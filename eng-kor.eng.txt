What happened?
What is wrong?
Get away from her!
What happened?
Get away from her!
Call an ambulance.
She can't leave here.
Her heart stopped beating.
She can't leave. - What happened?
We are going to the hospital.
I said you can't!
You hear me?
Her heart stopped beating.
I said no! We must go to a hospital.
We must get to a hospital right now.
Hurry up!
Hurry up!
Go!
Asset on board. En route.
12 cc's, epinephrine.
Clear.
Go, go!
Hurry up!
Hurry up!
Forty-five seconds.
Please leave.
What's wrong?
Stop.
Look, what's that?
Stop them. Stop that ambulance!
What are you looking for?
Get out!
Open the door.
Hurry up and open the door!
We need more adrenaline.
Cover her mouth.
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.
You're okay.
You're okay.
Rest. You'll be in America by morning.
We're taking you to Washington, D.C.
Do you know where the prisoner was transported to?
Ah, Washington.
Okay. Yeah, we'll take care of it.
Very good.
Hezbollah... they'll have to wait.
We're going back to Washington.
Washington? Heh, heh, heh.
Since when did Jolene Parker's case go from missing person to murder investigation?
Have you seen my keys?
Crazy.
Yeah, what, uh, happened?
The police say they have a person of interest.
Really?
Who is it? What do they know?
They're not sure.
Isn't it possible that she just left town like she said?
Moved to Dayton?
They found blood. Matches hers.
You see this stuff every day, you know, people getting hurt and killed.
And I don't. It freaks me out.
Just the thought of that happening to you, you know...
Just promise me you're as careful as you can be when you're at work.
The desk.
By the computer, that's where I saw your keys.
Oh. I'm gonna be so late.
I'm gonna give myself a tardy slip.
Found them.
They were under the newspaper.
What would I do without you?
I gotta run.
Tonight, for dinner, let's check out that new Thai place.
He knows something's off.
What makes you say that?
I can feel it.
I know him.
Tom is on his heels. He's behaving erratically.
He killed Jolene Parker.
Yes.
You knew?
Why didn't you tell me?
I felt if I told you, it would inform your behavior with him.
I found her body, called the police, and reported a missing person.
I was confident that in the course of their investigation, they would reach out to you and Tom.
Jolene Parker undoubtedly worked for the same organization as Tom.
In what capacity, I have no idea.
If they worked together, why would he murder her?
Perhaps he was ordered to.
Or perhaps he's just out of control, irrational, paranoid and reactionary.
He's scrambling for a foothold, and therein lies our opportunity to wait and to watch.
But Tom is not the reason I'm here.
I'm afraid there's something quite timely afoot.
The Pavlovich brothers are back in town.
The team that grabbed the general's daughter.
They're an extraction team.
Cut their teeth on Milošević's protective detail during the ethnic cleansing of the Yugoslav Wars.
We lost six of our men that day.
To the best of our knowledge the Pavlovich brothers have no political agenda.
They specialize in snatch-and-grabs, ranging from kidnap and ransom to extracting political dissidents.
Reddington says he has a contact.
A money launderer sourced by the brothers, claims they're coming after a Chinese scientist named Xiaoping Li.
What do we know?
Eighteen hours ago, the Agency sent an undercover team to extract her from a labor camp in the Yunnan province.
Break her out?
Why?
She's an immunologist specializes in viral and bacterial diseases.
Four months ago, she signaled to one of our assets to talk about a secret weapons program.
A month later, she was jailed for treason.
Scheduled to land at Andrews in an under an hour.
We have a team to escort her to Langley for a debriefing.
We got to assume the Pavlovich brothers
already know the route. - Reroute her. Bring her here.
Coordinate the adjustment with Langley.
Echo to Tango. Asset at drop point.
Thirty seconds to rendezvous.
This way. Quickly.
What's going on?
They said I'd be safe once I arrived.
We have a threat you're being targeted.
As a precaution, we've altered our route.
Get her up to the chopper.
Donald Ressler, FBI. Where's the asset?
Ground transport's been arranged. Negative.
Evac's been compromised.
Moving to Beta protocol.
Call it in.
All right. Okay. Copy that.
Anne Arundel County Sheriff's Department is reporting a downed aircraft burning 2 miles outside of Crofton.
No witnesses. We have units en route.
Gotta be the dump site on this chopper.
They knew CIA protocol, if the routes were compromised, they'd send air support.
These guys weren't based domestically.
They're gonna sneak out.
We should coordinate with Homeland, get their faces everywhere.
You wanna tell me why the director of National intelligence is calling?
What don't I know about this case?
The program Li was working on, it's germ weaponry, banned by nearly every nation on earth.
It's called Whitefog.
Day before she was jailed, Xiaoping Li sent a message indicating she had access to the designs.
If she did, and she shared those with us, that would represent the biggest intelligence coup in a decade.
A germ warfare program?
That's why the Chinese can't turn this into an international incident.
Where are you? Busy.
The brothers, they took Xiaoping Li?
How do you know?
You have a lead?
Something we...
Your husband is not in school. Wait.
Where is he?
Meet me at 9th and Constitution.
Reddington says he has a lead on the brothers. Wants to talk.
Let me know what NTSB says about that downed aircraft.
Called in sick this morning.
Returned home briefly before making a stop at the Radford Bank in Adams Morgan.
He's made three phone calls, all from pay phones.
He's been sitting at that cart for nearly an hour.
I'm sorry, Lizzy.
Don't be.
This must be difficult.
You wanna know what's hard?
Sitting here when all I really wanna do is get my hands around his throat.
Shouldn't we follow him?
We are.
They all work for you.
Lizzy, wait, wait. What are you do...?
Not now.
The boat? How long for the boat?
No. No. Please.
Tom?
Tom?
I'm in the dining room.
Where'd you get that thing?
I was gonna ask you the same question.
Found it in the basement.
That's where that was. I've been looking for it.
My father gave it to me. It's beautiful.
It's in great condition too.
Why haven't I seen this before?
Your pot is gonna boil over.
You're cooking?
I thought we were going out.
I just thought it might be nice, you know, stay home, alone, just you and me.
How was your day?
It was exhausting.
You know Billy Salter?
He was acting up again.
His mom keeps packing these fruit roll-ups, and they give him this satanic sugar-high, you know, so...
Oh, I did stop by the National Archives, just to maybe book a field trip for the kids.
It's funny. I...
I could have sworn that I saw you there.
There was a woman there, and she looked just like you.
No, I wish. I was cooped up in the office all day.
Yeah.
Should have known.
Well, whoever she was, she could not have been half as beautiful as you are right now.
All right. Keep stirring
I'm gonna walk the dog.
Come on, bud. Hey, hey, hey. Come here.
Hey, hey, hey. Where you going?
Come here. Come here.
Yes, you're a good boy. Yes, you are.
What?
Nothing.
Love you.
I'll be right back. Come on, bud. Come on.
Come on. Such a good boy.
You're a good boy.
Bantam Finance. How may I direct your call? Hi.
I'm having a problem with my account.
Number Delta, Sierra, 4-5-1.
Line is secure. Proceed.
Mockingbird knows. Requesting immediate evac.
She knows.
He's gone. My husband is gone.
Your husband never existed.
Lizzy, I understand why you went after Tom today.
The instinct to jump in is...
But it isn't gonna serve you well here.
And from the emotional point of view, this must feel like an extraordinary violation and betrayal.
But for Tom, it was business.
Do you know we had sex the other night?
Do you have any idea how filthy that makes me feel?
Unfortunately, you're chest-deep in filth.
You're gonna have to wade through it to get to the other side.
I fell in love with him.
I married him.
We were gonna have...
I was excited to have a child with him.
He was the one person I chose in my life who made me happy, who made me feel safe.
What does that say about me?
Everything that we had was just a figment of my imagination.
Worse than a figment, a lie.
It was right in front of my face, and I didn't see it.
I just believed it.
All of it.
Time is the only thing that will allow you to find yourself again.
If you tell me to be patient one more time, I swear to God.
I am going to find him, I'm gonna find answers, and I'm going to do it with or without your help.
The case. I need a lead.
Lizzy, if you wanna find where the Pavlovich brothers are you need to find out where they've been.
The helicopter is key.
The Pavlovich brothers burnt that chopper to cover up evidence.
DNA, fingerprints.
Those might have identified the brothers.
But the chopper?
The tail numbers were falsified, chopper was repainted.
But where did they do it?
ls there a deeper forensic analysis we can run?
What particulates were in the heat exchange?
Was there moisture in the compressor?
I'll reach Forensics.
Analyze every drop of fuel. Track every grain of sand.
I wanna know where that chopper's been.
That's him.
I'm sorry, man.
Not for hire. Hello, Symir. I'll be brief and to the point.
Yesterday you had a customer, picked him up outside the National Archives.
Sorry, man.
Oh, Symir.
You should have taken the money.
Your passenger, where'd you drop him?
Ha-ha-ha. Calculus.
I can't even think about derivatives without thinking of that tutor in Manor Hall.
Cindy something-or-other.
Never wore a brassiere, always a bounce in her step.
Look, I'm talking, cooperating.
You don't need to copy my driver's license, my credit cards.
We just wanna make sure we know where to reach you
Geoffrey P. Seevers"
...should we have more questions.
So tell me about the book.
I told you, I pick up and drop off.
I don't know names. I'm the messenger.
What is it?
Some kind of code?
How many times have you done this?
These drops?
This was the fourth.
I need you to write down the location of each drop you've made.
The pickup and the drop location.
Oh, my God. What?
Pagosa Springs Public Library.
I had a water pump go out in Pagosa Springs.
Bitch of a mountain. Wolf Creek Pass?
Thought I was gonna end up living out there with the hill people, until this teddy bear of a man fixed me up at the local garage.
I'll never forget him. Tracy Woods.
You don't know Tracy, do you?
Leather vest, mustache. Tracy Woods?
No.
I wonder if he's still fixing water pumps.
Anyway, it'll always be a fond memory.
The list.
So that's it?
We're...
The package? You're gonna deliver it or return it.
Whatever the people you work for want you to do with it.
And as far as you're concerned, we never had this conversation.
Dembe?
A copy, please.
I hope you have nothing pressing.
This may take a minute or three.
You sure you don't know him?
Leather vest, mustache. Tracy Woods?
Shame. Ha-ha-ha.
Hey.
I got something. Hey.
I never wanted to know this much about gas chromatography or gear lubricants but I think Mr. Reddington is onto something.
Look at this.
We pulled the lab reports from the NTSB, and the chopper's engine tested positive for two distinct compounds.
The first is ethephon, which is a ripening agent for tobacco.
And how does that help us? Take a look.
Tobacco production's way down in this area.
Since 1998, the federal government is actually paying farmers not to grow it.
There's still plenty of tobacco farms.
I agree, which brings us to chemical compound number two.
This one is used to grow sweet corn.
So we cross-reference the two? Exactly.
We are looking for a pesticide manufacturer who used to supply tobacco growers but transitioned to corn.
And how many of those are there?
Seventeen.
Wait.
Of those, 11 are outside of the fuel range of this chopper.
Of the other six, only one has a structure large enough to get that stolen helicopter out of view, under construction.
Halifax Agro-Chem.
if I had to bet
I'd say that's their staging site.
it's around the corner, half a block up.
I make seven exterior cameras, and those are the ones they want us to see.
And it's on the list of drop sites I gave you? Yes.
How long has Mr. Keen been inside?
I tailed him here four hours ago.
Lovely. Thank you, Preston.
You want me to call Sabusawa?
That would be ideal, but he's working an extraction in Ecuador.
Then how do you plan on getting Keen out of that concrete box?
We have a lead on Xiaoping Li.
Excellent.
Tell me.
She's being held at Halifax Agro-Chem in Falls Church.
We're assembling a team.
Lizzy, about Tom.
I don't wanna talk about Tom with you.
You have your opinion on how to proceed, I have mine.
Just don't bother yourself. I'll deal with Tom.
Lizzy, I assure you that will yield no answers and little satisfaction.
Well, I'll find out, won't I?
I wish I could talk you out of this.
You can't.
Well, good luck with Xiaoping...
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
I'm Raymond Reddington.
Hey. Look at this.
What are we looking at?
I have no idea.
Hey! Get out of here.
Go!
Package set.
Move into position.
Three, two, one.
What the hell was that?
Out, out!
Move!
Fall back. Asset en route.
Two cars.
Keen is in the lead.
Keen is still loose.
Bump him off the road!
Again!
it looks like some sort of serial number.
Or an atomic number. Something from a periodic table.
Why do you think that?
Because the only word I know that contains the letters V-G together is avgolemono.
I don't know what that is.
It's a soup.
Chicken stock, egg yolks and lemon juice.
What?
I cook.
The point is maybe Xiaoping Li left us a message.
I'll run the letter combination against the DMV registry, see if we can get a hit.
Any luck?
I can't get ahold of Reddington.
You told him the location where the brothers were holding Xiaoping Li.
Mm-hm.
Don't you find it a hell of a coincidence that we show up there, they're gone, and now we can't get ahold of Reddington?
We've been played.
No. Red put us on to the brothers because it would lead him straight to Xiaoping Li.
That woman's worth millions.
Where are you going?
I'm going to find Reddington, get some answers.
Reddington, I need you to call me, please.
I need some help with the case.
FINGERS A gift from Reddington. Enjoy.
Two years wasted.
Two years we spent. On what?
Do you care at all what you've done to me?
What you've done to my life?
What has it done to you?
Who could do such a thing?
Finding you, stopping you.
You'd think I'd be happy you're gonna spend the rest of your life in prison.
You'd think I'd get some satisfaction out of that, but I don't.
Because nothing... no sentence, no punishment, no revenge could ever come close to making up for what you've done.
I was doing my job.
Your job?
That was our life.
We were going to have a baby to...
You begged me to have a baby.
I was doing my job.
Stop talking about your job!
You, this, everything was a lie!
My life was a lie!
Every feeling, every memory.
Say something to your wife who's dying in front of you.
Say something.
It was the shoes.
What does that mean?
That's when I knew.
It was those brown leather shoes.
It was our third or maybe fourth date.
You'd come over to my place on Halstead and we ordered takeout, and rented a movie that we never finished because we ended up...
And you had to get up early for work.
And by the time I got up, you were gone.
I remember standing in the closet, half-dressed, reaching for my shoes when I saw that you had drawn this little heart in the dust on my shoe.
You remember that?
It was the sweetest thing.
And ever since that moment, I just felt... sorry for you.
Because I knew.
I knew that I had you.
Part of me didn't want it to work.
But it did.
Archimedes.
I beg your pardon?
Archimedes' formula.
You know, the naked guy who shouted "eureka."
Why a mathematical formula?
Maybe it's some kind of code.
Archimedes' principle indicates that the upward buoyant force which is exerted on a body immersed in fluid whether fully...
Aram.
Um, water displacement. Boats displace water.
She's trying to tell us how they're getting her out of the country.
Contact the Coast Guard.
Get photos of the brothers and Xiaoping to every port authority on the Eastern seaboard.
What are you gonna tell him?
Hey, what's going on?
Where are we on Xiaoping Li?
They're trying to ship her out of the country.
We're combing through manifests. Where are you?
Waiting on Reddington. He still hasn't shown.
I'm telling you, Keen. He used us.
The Pavlovich brothers, you remember what they did.
You were there that day on the bridge.
When we take them down, I want you there.
I will be, just as soon as...
I'm gonna have to call you back.
Nice try.
I was thirsty.
Yes?
Where is she?
Who?
Xiaoping Li. You took her.
You used the FBI and the Pavlovich brothers to get to Tom, and what, get Xiaoping?
Trade on her secrets?
I have no use for germ warfare.
As for using the FBI, I wouldn't be in this relationship if there wasn't a mutual benefit.
Where is she?
I don't know.
I tried to bargain for her life, but negotiations went sideways.
It was all I could do to get Tom.
If she gets sent back to the Chinese, she's gonna die.
Tell me what you know.
We think they're putting her on a cargo ship. Not sure.
We're looking over the manifests and shipping routes.
She isn't cargo, Lizzy.
She's contraband. This is a smuggling operation.
And nothing gets smuggled in or out of the Chesapeake without Rolph Cisco knowing about it.
Have Donaldpay him a visit.
What is his obsession with you?
You guys got, like, a daddy-daughter thing going on?
What's your plan?
Is Daddy coming over?
Is he gonna make me talk?
No, he's not.
I am.
Rolph Cisco?
Tell us about the Pavlovich brothers.
Who do you work for?
I have nothing to say.
Who do you work for?
Liz, come on.
You don't have it in you.
Let me out of here! Please!
Get me out!
Get me out!
It's okay. it's okay. Easy, easy.
We're the good guys.
Come here. Come here.
I'm gonna put you down.
Easy.
You broke my thumb. Yeah, I did.
If you're looking for sympathy you might wanna start with honesty.
Here's an example of honesty, Tom.
You've been making me pancakes for two years.
I hate pancakes.
You want honest?
Here's one.
If you're gonna handcuff somebody, don't break their thumb.
Your handcuffs, one on the wrist, one on the banister.
I am not here to hurt you, Liz.
My job was never to hurt you.
I'm one of the good guys.
Reddington, he's not who you think.
I will find you.
I can prove it.
The key in the lamp, I know you found it.
Take it to Radford Bank. Box number 3929.
He is not who you think he is.
Goodbye, Liz.

And then something new will begin.
You deserve the best in life, Lizzy.
I know that sounds odd coming from a man who has brought you some of the worst.
But it's the reason why Tom had to work so hard to be that for you.
To be kind, to be thoughtful, make you laugh, to make you love him.

Where have you two been?
You're all dirty.
Are you done, aunt Pin?
I'm going to prepare the tea for the Venerable.
See you tomorrow, mute.
Let's go. I'll give you a bath.
Put on some talcum. Prepare for bed.
Turn your other cheek this way.
The temple had seven sugar palm trees.
The Myna had gone to rob the temple and hadn't come back.
While I was rowing the boat to give him rice,
Follow me
See you tomorrow, uncle.
Salute, novice.
Move quickly.
It's dark now. Don't be sluggish.
Walk quickly.
Too many requests. You want to sleep alone?
Keep walking. You'll see a rectory.
Hey, aren't you supposed to lead me there?
I've led you far enough. You can walk by yourself now.
Are you new here, novice?
Hmm.
My name is Tin.
You can call me Brother Tin. Or Venerable.
What's your name?
Sun.
Are you staying here?
Hmm.
No one stayed here for a long time.
I think you'd better stay with other monks.
It's alright. I can stay.
Then I'll stay with you here.
Just to get past tonight.
He's crazy.
What is he saying?
He's avowing his sins.
Avowing his sins?
What is that?
Avowing a monk's sins is, to put it simply, is accepting the mistakes one has committed
so you will not face punishment.
Just saying these words? That's easy.
I was in juvenile detention for two years.
My dad hasn't forgiven me.
Wake up.
Wake up.
It's still dark.
I'm sorry.
It's alright.
Today is Waxing Gibbous of the Ninth Month.
Or the Rice Merit for the Earth Day
It's another day that family members meet.
Friends and cousins come together.
To help each other make banana leave baskets.
To send merit to the hungry demons, wandering ghosts,
and departed relatives. - His preaching was very impressive.
This is the only time. -It's a shame he doesn't normally preach.
He rarely speaks. - Yes. - He rarely speaks.
that the hell's gate opens.
On this meritorious occasion, I'm asking all of you to think and reflect
Grandma.
Yes - on what you have done.
Can I go outside?
While you are alive, - Yes, dear.
you must be conscientious.
Only think and do good deeds.
So that when you are deceased, you won't have to wait for merits.
The merits is your own duty to make for yourself.
I'm home.
Don't worry. I know you miss me.
Hiding form someone?
Good.
No one comes here.
Got a light?
Are you from around here?
No.
I'm from another place, just like you.
I was put in care of the master since I was young.
When I first came here, everything seemed strange.
But I was lucky to have friend.
So I wasn't lonely.
Your friend?
The mute?
He was born here.
Since I came here, he has been my only friend.
My die-hard friend.
It's a shame he can't speak.
And...
You can take it.
Go to the temple after you're done.
If you stay here too long, people will get suspicious.
Hello.
I've eaten.
Any good?
Yummy.
Can I go out with my friends tonight?
Are you okay?
Are you upset?
You can't go.
I just want to see my friends.
Let me go hang out with them.
Don't mad at me. Come on.
I don't want you to.
Are you talking to your girlfriend?
I won't tell anyone.
Are you from Bangkok?
You've come a long way.
Do you like to come here?
It's quiet.
I come here when I come to the temple with grandma.
Oh, why are there full of banana leave packs? Why do people put them on the ground?
Oh, they're the little rice packs.
We put them on the ground for the deceased. Also for the hungry demons, or wandering ghosts.
Hungry demons?
People who commit grave sins become hungry demons after they die.
Being as tall as the palm tree but having a mouth hole as small as the needle.
Today is the only day they can get merits.
You're talking like you have seen them.
I've never seen them.
Grandma said the hungry demons only show themselves to people they want to be seen.
The ones who see them will make merits for them.
What's your name?
Fai.
What's yours?
Sun.
It's a monk's duty. Don't dawdle.
Am I your friend?
You want trouble?
Sun.
Sun.
That's enough.
Venerable.
Sun hit me.
You dare?
Enough.
I will have a talk with Sun.
You will stay here tonight.
I'm not sleeping here.
Rich teen hits and runs Student dies in front of school
Let me have a cigarette.
Do you have something in mind?
Brother, have you seen any ghosts since you've ordained?
Why? You saw one?
I'm not sure.
I saw a woman around my rectory.
She was wierded me out.
I have no idea with her.
What you saw was probably aunt Pin.
She had a son.
They said from the first moment that child was born, he never stopped crying.
On the third day, aunt Pin decided to bring her baby to the Venerable.
This baby has been crying for three days.
Then a miracle happened.
As soon as that baby was in the Venerable's arms, he immediately stopped crying.
But he didn't only stop crying, he also stopped talking.
and he can't talking since then.
What about that woman now?
She's what you saw.
You asshole.
What the hell were you doing?
What the hell were you doing?
You've done this several times.
What is going on?
Had the Venerable not protected you, you would've been long gone.
Just let him go. Don't hurt him.
What a bastard to eat offerings for the ghosts.
Why did you stop me?
Calm down.
Let's clean things up.
Just watch out. Let's clean things up. Fai.
Come help me.
You shouldn't have stopped me.
He's done it several times.
Don't pay attention to him.
I'll kill you if I see you again.
There they come.
Last night, I dreamt of Pin.
So today, I made steamed fish in banana leaves.
Just like how you like it.
May you prosper with age, health and energy.
Looks relaxing.
Delicious?
I'm still not used to it.
Oh. What do you like?
I'll make it for you.
Are we going to talk like this?
Are you coming down? Or I will come up.
Beautiful.
It's a lot more fun to shout like this.
Eggs in gravy.
Huh?
Really?
Not too difficult. You won't starve here.
I'll make that tomorrow.
You can cook?
Of course. It's easy.
One pot, and you have something to eat for several days.
Hey.
Can you tell me about Bangkok?
What do people there do? Where do they go?
What's cool?
After school, they go to Siam area.
Shopping. Watching movies. Eating.
Things like that. Do you know Siam?
Hmm.
But I don't like going there.
I prefer listening to music, watching movies and relaxing.
And drinking.
Does your name come from the Sun?
No.
Actually my dad named me Son.
But I wanted it to be Sun.
Why?
Isn't it good to be a son?
How is it?
It's good.
The person who made it must be glad.
Do you have a boyfriend?
Is your girlfriend pretty?
Why did you change the topic?
I bet your girlfriend must be pretty.
I heard people in Bangkok are all good looking.
You like Bangkok people?
Just go on eating.
Please, Venerable.
You bastard.
You again?
Too many times now.
Teach him a lesson.
Help.
Help.
Get up.
Stop. Please stop.
I beg you as a favor.
Please take him back to the temple.
Hey.
Bastard monk.
What?
Why didn't you take my call?
Why did you go out?
Who's that boy you took picture with on Facebook.
Answer me.
Raising your voice all this for what?
You started it again.
I can't take it anymore.
We only have bad things together.
I've been waiting for you for two years.
You might be able to let our baby go.
But I can't.
We can't be together anymore.
I've had enough.
Without you, I still won't die.
Shit.
Hey.
Get out of here now.
Go.
I'm scared.
I'm scared. / Go.
I told you to go.
I'm scared.
I'm scared.
Eat.
Eat. Eat.
Mad man.
Wait.
You can stay here tonight.
Someone died here.
Sun. Novice Sun.
Novice Sun.
Novice Sun.
Quickly. Venerable.
Quickly.
Quickly.
Venerable.
Quickly. Venerable.
He is drenched with alcohol smell.
Tomorrow is Observance Day.
Confess your sin to me in the evening.
Can I leave monkhood now?
I will see if you have an appropriate time.
I'm in front of your house. Need to talk.
Wait a moment. Meet in the next house.
You like it?
The son of the owner draw it.
Whose house is this?
A friend of grandma's.
She died a long time ago.
But grandma regularly comes here to clean up. Because the Venerable asked her to.
What is it that you want to talk to me?
I need to tell you that I'm leaving monkhood.
When?
Soon. The Venerable is finding the time.
Is it not pleasant here?
Do you really want to leave monkhood?
Which brands?
Hey. Don't you ever want to leave monkhood?
Why did you get ordained?
I got ordained for that mute.
He wanted to but couldn't do it.
Why?
He can't speak.
So he can't say prayers.
Because he can't say prayers, he can't get ordained.
But why did you want to get ordained?
I wanted to fix some mistakes.
Were you able to do it?
It's up to whether we truly want to do it.
If we truly want to fix it, it means we accept our mistakes.
It's not important whether we can fix it or not.
How about you?
You haven't told me if you really want to leave monkhood.
Of course.
I know a guy like me doesn't belong here.
You miss home?
Miss your friends?
Girlfriend?
If you don't have anything to worry, why do you want to leave?
I don't know why I should be a monk.
I'd better go to bed.
Mute. Mute.
Where are you? You win.
Mute.
You can come out now. I quit.
Tin. Have you prepared the tea for the Venerable?
Stop playing now. Damn it.
Yes, sir.
Mute. Come out now. I quit.
I'm going to make tea for the Venerable. I'll be back.
Mute. I'll get you. Mute.
I got you now.
Have I sinned by behaving like this?
I'm a monk. We're not sinners.
Does it mean you won't leave monkhood?
Don't tell anyone.
Don't tell anyone. Understand?
Sun.
Sun.
Wake up.
Sun.
Wake up.
I can leave monkhood now?
You don't have a good time to do that.
What's that supposed to mean?
It means you can't leave monkhood, until you have a good time.
Don't do that.
Be patient.
Whatever happens, don't take of the robe.
Hello.
Hello.
Mom.
I want to go home.
Be patient.
Everything is getting better.
I will try to talk to your father.
Do you want to talk to him?
I'll talk to you later.
Let me see. No.
You can't.
Do I look ugly?
Let me see.
look, you look fat.
No. No.
Let me see.
Come on.
Let's see this picture.
It's a good one. I'll show you. Wait.
Wait a minute. I'll show you another one.
Fai.
Huh?
Will you miss me after I've gone back to Bangkok?
It's not pleasant to stay here?
Can I see you tonight?
Aunt Pin?
Aunt Pin. You need to get out. Your son is coming.
Aunt Pin.
What if your son knows who his father is?
What do you think he would feel?
Mom.
Fai.
What?
The owner of the house next to you, was her name Pin?
She hanged herself at the rectory, didn't she?
Yes, you know about this?
Right.
Why did she have to hang herself?
Grandma used to tell me that she fell in love with the Venerable.
But her love was ignored.
She couldn't stand it. So she hanged herself.
And no one thought they could be in love?
Grandma said, any girl who does that commits a grave sin.
She will become a hungry demon after death.
Has a female but in horrifying form.
And will never get reborn.
Do you believe it?
I only believe in love.
When two people are in love, being right or wrong is between those two.
What about the sin?
Grandma always teaches me to love my father.
If I hate my father, I will have sinned.
But I've never understood.
Is it not a sin for him to leave me and grandma?
What does a sin look like?
I have never seen it.
A novice or a monk or just ordinary people,
what different does it make about being in love?
Fai.
Go to Bangkok with me.
That's my body.
Have I told you before? Don't take off the robe.
Are you scared?
Are you scared of the things you can see?
What about the things you can't see?
Tin. Why do you come inside?
Who is that?
About aunt Pin, I tried to keep quiet, because I thought you were going to stop.
How many more children will be born like my mute friend?
Have you ever thought about that?
Tin, I'm the one who raised you.
But you never stopped.
Aunt Pin has died a long time ago.
You are still sleeping with other women.
A bastard like you doesn't deserve to wear monk's robe.
If you don't leave monkhood, I will announce to the villagers that you are sinful. Get out.
I'm getting out.
Are you alright. I'm worried.
I'm coming.
Are you here to see Sun?
He doesn't seem to be here. Will you wait?
Yes, sir.
What's your name?
Why haven't I seen you before?
My name is Tin.
Oh, Venerable Tin.
Where have you been?
My grandma used to talk about you.
I thought you're supposed to be older than this.
And what are you here for?
When two people meet, they must have done something together.
So I am curious.
What have you done that brought you to me?
Well, I'm coming to see Sun. And you are here.
Do we need to do something together so we can meet?
And aren't you going to your rectory?
I'm waiting for the time to confess my sins to the Venerable.
It's time now.
I may leave now.
Karma means action.
If you know karma, you will know sins.
I hope we will see each other again.
Fai.
Sun.
Is that you?
Fai.
Sun.
Where are you?
Sun.
The mad man.
I hid it. Why did you take it out?
Mad man. Did you kill Tin?
I'm not leaving monkhood. I'm not going.
I'm not leaving monkhood.
I'm not going.
I'm not leaving monkhood.
I'm not going.
I'm not leaving monkhood.
I'm not going.
Let's go, Fai.
Bastard monk.
But you never stopped.
Aunt Pin has died a long time ago.
A bastard like you doesn't deserve to wear monk's robe.
Get out. If you don't leave monkhood, I will announce to the villagers that you are sinful.
Bastard monk.
Bastard monk.
Bastard monk.
Bastard monk.
Sun.
Sun.
Sun.
Get out, novice.
Do you want to be a holy man who helps sinners.
Or do you want to be a sinner who waits for merits?
Do you see me?
I pray for my mother to be free from suffering.
Mute, you can speak.
I heard you speaking.
Mute. Talk to me.
I'm your friend.
Why don't you talk to me?
I can't talk.
Now you are talking, aren't you?
If I talk, I will see them.
Mute.
If you can't get ordained for your mother, I will do it for you.
I found you at last.
Tin.
Mute, you can speak.
Why don't you talk to me?
You have a good time to leave monkhood now.
Ask you mother and father.
Just tell me when you're ready.
Do you know now why you get ordained?
[English subtitles are available]
Quantum mechanics proposes that there is not just one universe.
There are multiple universes.
One of them is a parallel universe similar to earth civilization.
This area is covered by ocean.
People built Wuji City on the largest island.
While the desperadoes and rovers drifted on the sea, and turned into pirates.
Due to the backwardness of technological civilization and the lack of resources for survival, people started the legendary new land exploration journey.
Thus, the hot-blooded sailing adventure era begun.
[New Land]
But no one has ever arrived.
In the face of the reality of broken legends, the pirates aimed at the resource plunder, conquering non-stop.
Invade Wuji City and plunder everything they have.
Tomorrow, it will be your turn to be coastguards.
Kill all the coastguards.
We, as the last righteous army on this continent, must win this battle and protect Wuji City.
Now the North Sea Yama has led all his pirate ships out to invade our waters and point their swords at our Wuji City.
The situation is grim and not optimistic.
Take up your weapons.
Get ready for battle!
[The Warlord of The Sea]
I've given the strategic plan to Luo Li.
Now it's up to Luo Li to give you the deployment.
Geese formation.
Change the formation.
Fire!
Fire!
Fire!
Ignite!
Fire!
Fire!
Get down!
Fire!
Fire!
Fire!
Fire!
Fire!
Everyone, side sail forty-five degrees.
Machine prepare.
Machine ready.
Stop!
The ships come from the left, and you made left full rudder.
Are you looking for a collision?
Right, right full rudder.
Now it's force 6 northwest wind, with all the points of action at our stern.
If we make the right full rudder, the left deflection moment caused by the wind plus the lateral force of the accompanying current will make us unable to move at all.
Their ships are downwind.
They will ram us to pieces.
Launch!
Get up!
Everyone get up!
Sacrifice them to the sea!
For the sake of Wuji City.
Kill them!
Look!
There is something on the sea.
Luo Li.
What are you doing?
Run!
Brother.
What do we do now?
Fall back.
Yes.
[Wuji City]
Those black and gold coffins on the coast floated to the shore, with a large amount of unidentified gas inside, resulting in heavy casualties among the people.
Luo Li.
This case is much more important than fighting pirates.
Now everyone is watching our Coastguard Commission.
Did you find any clues from the shore?
According to my investigation, the black gas in the black coffin is a kind of algae.
It is similar to an ancient plant recorded in the 'Book of Human Plants.'
It can only reproduce in large numbers on land where water and grass are abundant.
It suggests that there is one such land in the world at least.
And there is a strange pattern on the inside of the black coffin.
One of the dots is obviously the topographic map of Wuji City
[Wuji City Coastguard Commission]
So I presume
[North Sea Mengpo North Sea Impermanence] this is the sea map.
I have invited Tu Gedong, a scholar from the new land who has studied sea maps elaborately.
Where did you get this baby?
A lunatic asylum.
Okay, okay, okay.
Is he crazy or are you crazy?
This is the new land.
I did my research correctly.
It seems that the new land is not just a legend.
[New Land]
Mr. Tu.
Please help us to set sail immediately.
No one can arrive the new land.
[Fresh water]
A legend says that the new land
[Gold] has an inexhaustible supply of resources.
[Farming land] [Wood]
But you must pass through the extremely dangerous Waters of Death
[Minerals] to arrive.
The waters are full of fierce sea beasts.
Especially, the Lantern Ghost King.
Unless there is someone who understands the sea language.
[Wuji Iceland]
File records, this person is called sea woman.
Three years ago, in exchange for the lives of her crew, she volunteered to be taken to the ice prison.
Pirates can be so righteous?
Really?
[Hai Ji]
You are sea woman.
Can you leave if I say no?
Don't you want to know why we are looking for you?
You want to make me work for you.
You can get out of here if you want.
So I just come and go at your wish?
Hai Ji.
If we dedicate this to you, is it enough to show our sincerity?
The Wanhai conch was originally my treasure, but you took it away, now
this is called return.
Since it is returned to its rightful owner, let's get right to the point.
Hai Ji.
Our Coastguard Commission wants to cooperate with you.
Cooperate?
It's hard to say if it's sincere or a ruse.
Back then, your Wuji City was afraid of my ability, and used the lives of my crew to blackmail me to voluntarily surrender.
I am in the ice prison, but you tried to threaten me several times to work for you.
And now you're talking to me about cooperation.
Do you think I am naive, or you are really hypocritical?
That was all the dirty work of my former commissioner of Coastguard Commission.
It has only been a year since I took office and we are not the same at all.
Not the same?
Your brain has not evolved very thoroughly.
You.
Don't be in a hurry to reject.
We haven't thrown in our real price yet.
Our real price is a piece of land on the new land
for you to house the crews and rovers you take in.
Hai ji.
We know you were looking for the new land before you went to prison.
The new land was found?
No way.
That would have changed the world a long time ago.
And how could you be so kind?
I know.
You have clues about the new land.
But you are short of people, especially me.
Clever.
Since we all have the same goal, let's go as soon as possible.
Wait.
I haven't proposed my condition yet.
I don't know what could be a more tempting condition than the new land.
On this voyage, we must use my crew and my Black Widow.
Your Black Widow is drifting on the sea.
Where can we find it?
My crew must be waiting nearby.
As long as I blow this Wanhai conch, the sea bottle will definitely appear.
Hai Ji.
Your Black Knight is here.
I don't believe any word they said.
When I think of what you've suffered these years.
If I do not kill them a thousand times,
I'm sorry for my "top 100 pirates" title.
Don't we have Wanhai conch?
Blow it.
Summon those deep sea beasts.
Let's go straight to the Coastguard Commission and kill them.
Just do it.
Uh.
Brother.
Uh.
Well.
Cooperation is important and let's move on.
All past crimes and sentences can be commuted.
Commutation?
Commutation.
I had a hard time getting on the list of top 100 pirates, just barely worthy of Haiji.
Are you going to give me a commutation?
When did you also become one of the top 100 pirates?
To chase after you, just entered today.
Am I good?
Calm down.
I do need to calm down.
I need to think about how to let the world know about this.
Sea bottle.
Your real name is Ruan Mengmeng.
Ruan.
Ranked 100th, with a reward of 8,000 Belly.
You are far from Hai Ji.
So that's how it is.
I must take you two to improve my ranking today.
Put out the fire.
You, put out the fire.
The agreement was reached only 10 minutes ago, and it changed in a flash.
Of course.
There is no trust between human beings.
But, luckily,
I have never trusted anybody.
I
Listen.
We can choose to die together.
Or, you guys can jump into the sea.
Who are you battling with here?
You pick the wrong guy.
Then I will light it up.
Put it out.
Put it out!
You didn't blow it out.
Enough!
Keep blowing.
Put it out!
It's on! It's on fire!
Enough!
Do you need me to help you blow it out?
I, Hai Ji, swear by my blood.
I will do what I say.
You can stand if you want.
But I am sure the new land will not come to you itself.
I only say this once.
Since we are on the same ship.
Once the ship sinks, no one can survive.
When you get on my ship, you must learn to trust.
Pick up the old scholar you mentioned and set sail immediately.
Just wait.
Fasten the ropes.
Yes.
I finally know why you insist on using the Black Widow.
Okay.
The keel of the ship is made of ghost trees which grown in deep seas for thousands of years
and is extremely tough.
Take the ammo.
Yes.
It can withstand several tons of pressure.
But it is light in weight with a shallow draft.
Put it here.
Maybe, it is a powerful weapon for us to drive through the Waters of Death and defeat the Lantern Ghost King.
You do know about the value of this ship.
Sails up.
Move things there.
Yes.
Fasten it tight.
Come on.
One, two, three, go.
Come on.
Go.
Watch it.
Course.
Thirty-five degrees southeast.
Take a break, take a break.
Our captain has her own navigator.
Idiot.
Adjust the course to thirty-five degrees and head to the right side.
It's so easy to control these marine animals.
You know nothing about the true power.
Sail down the wind at full speed.
Yes.
Yes.
I am going to prepare the sailing ceremony.
Let these idiots see something unusual.
Watch it out.
Yes.
[Island of Skeletons]
[Waters of Storm]
[Waters of Guangzhi]
Turn the rudder to 15 degrees southeast and sail 7,500 nautical miles.
After ten days, we will arrive at the target area.
Commissioner Zhang is a person good at social intercourse.
He can play with anyone.
Hai Ji, I am here.
Let me go.
Mine, I...
Hai Ji.
Hai Ji.
Put me down.
Hai Ji.
Let me go.
You...
You...
Let me go.
Hai Ji.
Take your hands away.
You.
You dare to touch our Hai Ji.
Let go of her.
Come here, here.
Coming.
You are different from the other coastguards I have met.
I am more handsome than them.
I mean it's different here.
You have something in your heart.
And they don't have.
This is not definite.
For example, our commissioner.
He has an abacus in his heart.
With your ability and means, you can't be just a normal coastguard.
Tell me.
What's your secrets?
We have just met.
It's inappropriate to talk about my secrets.
Did you forget?
I said since you are on my ship, you must learn to trust.
I won't allow someone unreliable to be around me.
This is a long story.
The last thing you lack on the sea is time.
All right.
Everything has to start with it.
Since I was born, this compass was with me.
[Why is there a baby in the box?
]
[Let me borrow some of your milk.]
[You rogue.]
[All the crew work as the father.]
[It costs a lot to raise him up.]
[He is surprisingly talented.]
[It's a shame to follow the cargo ship.]
[Take these two things.]
[They are the only clues to your birth story.]
[New Land]
So, the new land on the compass becomes your goal.
I believe my relatives are waiting for me at some distant place.
This longing is a bond.
People have bonds, life has a goal, isn't it?
She believed it!
Yes.
You have goals.
She believes in the story.
But all I have is my brothers.
This can be nice.
We laugh and talk and life goes on.
Man, you take it too easy.
I have a story.
Do you have money?
Damn.
You are so shameless.
Well, well, well.
I will buy it.
Hai Ji.
You will definitely fall in love with me.
To love or not to love, is really a tough question.
Since it's a tough question, you should go to sleep quickly.
Do not make tricks.
What happened?
Are you sick?
Apart from loving you,
I have no other disease.
Don't say such scary words.
Just tell me.
Why are you coughing blood?
Silly Bottle, what happened to you?
No...nothing.
Tell me.
Last time, when I went to save you in the ice prison with our brothers.
My lung was beaten through by those coastguards.
Now it turns to lung cancer.
Final stage.
How?
In this world, the only person I can't let go is you.
But I know what I am.
I know I look like this.
I didn't except you to accept me.
Actually, today is my birthday.
I make a wish.
I just want to spend the rest of my life accompanying you.
I want to cry with you, laugh with you
and go to distant places with you.
I want to see the sunrise and sunset and the rise and fall of tides every day with you.
Your world can be without me, but in mine,
all I have is you.
It is the last wish of my about-to-end life.
How many dishes do you have?
How can you be drunk like this?
Aren't you an abandoned baby?
Why do you know your own birthday?
I have mixed up the two stories.
There is noise out there.
What happened over there?
Who rang the bell and interrupted my business?
This is the legendary Waters of Death.
[Waters of Death]
I think we are being watched by the Lantern Ghost King.
Its powerful magnetic field will make all ships lose their directions and stay still.
And finally all ships will die in the belly of the fish.
Here belongs to the Lantern Ghost King.
Blue whales can't come inside.
The Lantern Ghost King appears.
Mr. Tu, please hide in the cabin.
Quickly.
Hai Ji, speak your sea language.
Hai Ji.
What does that thing say?
Isn't it obvious enough what it says?
It wants to eat us.
Help me!
The Lantern Ghost King is moving too fast.
But it can't break the Black Widow,
I am afraid it will swallow the entire ship.
If it goes on like this, we will all die.
Now there is only one way.
Kill it.
You do have some masculinity.
Just like me.
Just do it!
Where is my knife?
Take it.
You finally learn to trust.
Hai Ji.
Luo Li.
Luo Li.
Hai Ji.
Hai Ji.
What is that sound?
Luo Li.
Luo Li.
You are hard to kill, aren't you?
Don't you dare to die.
I'm determined to take you as a brother.
Luo Li.
Luo Li.
Luo Li.
Luo Li.
You are finally awake.
You are finally awake, my brother.
Look how anxious I am for you.
I thought it must be really bad.
Good news is you are all right.
Luo Li.
Here.
Have something good to eat.
Make up for your body.
I'll put it here.
Have a seat.
Why are you looking so pale?
You got caught by the Lantern Ghost King.
Hai Ji came to rescue you, and she only came to life after three days in coma.
Looking pale?
I kept her company for three days and nights, why didn't you say I look pale?
Look at my dark circles.
What are you talking about.
I'm fine.
This time, thanks to Luo Li, who held back the Lantern Ghost King, we could drive out of the Waters of Death.
At that time,
I didn't know why, but my body
seemed to have gone through some change.
It felt like my body...
Awakened?
Right.
It is really you.
I finally found you.
You were looking for me?
So you are?
No, no, no.
I'm not your father.
But
I do know about him.
Twenty years ago, to meet the extreme lack of resources in the future,
Luo Dayong and I were appointed as researchers, to develop a reagent that can evolve human body real fast to adapt to living in the sea.
At first, it was only experimented on mammals.
[Evolution Plan]
But later I found that
Luo Dayong went go so far as to experiment on you.
Therefore,
I rescued you.
He got into a rage and I had to send you on a merchant ship.
After that, Luo Dayong went missing.
I have been very self-condemned that I didn't stop him.
So I kept looking for you.
You might be the only guinea pig that has successfully evolved.
That is why you have such powers.
This is unfortunate, yet fortunate in another sense.
I have looked for him for so many years.
I never expected that he was such a despicable person.
Luo Li.
I know that since the emotional link is broken, you must be very sad for a while.
But don't worry.
We will be here for you.
Rest assured.
You have got us at least.
Luo Li.
It is not a big deal.
Don't you take it too hard.
Right.
Perhaps, you, my partners,
are the real emotional links for me.
Since we were all born in this cruel world,
no one can live like an islet, alone on the sea.
Every one of us is like a little piece of mud.
Only when these pieces connect with each other,
the real new land can be formed.
They are so pretentious.
You are so...
Something went wrong! Something went wrong!
Someone has found his way up here.
Commissioner.
Commissioner, help me.
I had no choice.
So it was you who gave away our route.
We can't beat them.
Run.
Commissioner.
Run.
Stop there.
What is that? Leave it.
Go, go.
Go.
Captain, we found this sea map on him.
The new land?
Assemble the other four kings, and send out a secret order to all pirates on the sea.
I will hold the King of Pirates Convention at the Senluo Market.
Yes.
This world is about to change.
Yama and others didn't catch up.
Mr. Tu and Commissioner Zhang must have been caught.
Even if I have to die,
I will reseize the Black Widow.
No way.
Luo Li has just recovered. We can't bear a tough fight.
Luo Li, why didn't you turn into a fish just now?
Let's go back to where the Black Widow was at.
We may find some clues.
That is too dangerous.
If we can find out where the Black Widow is heading, we can trace them down easily.
These markers are specially made by the Coastguard Commission.
They will float on the sea and won't move due to winds or waves.
This must be the clue that Commissioner Zhang left for us.
Never thought the old codger would be so conscious.
[Senluo Sea Market]
What is this place?
That should be the entrance to the Senluo Sea Market.
Go through this and straight to the end, there will be the real Senluo Sea Market.
This trip will be fraught with grim possibilities.
We can only do it by strategy, not tough confrontation.
There's no coward in us.
Let's just do it.
Welcome to the World of Pirates.
There is only one rule at the Senluo Sea Market.
As long as you can offer enough chips, you can trade for any resource.
[Hai Ji] [Wang En]
Want some potion?
Magic fruit, want one?
[North Sea Yama]
[North Sea Yama North Sea Mengpo] [Ruan Mengmeng]
Weird.
Where am I?
Here, here.
This is me, isn't it?
Take a photo for me.
Here.
No problem.
Take a photo. Here.
Here, again.
Another pose.
Good.
One more.
We have business to attend to. Let's go.
One more, please.
I'm not done.
Don't miss out on this.
Take a look.
Hold on.
Kill and rob? Knife not handy?
Am I having illusions?
Assassination, but with fear of being found?
Suicide, but with fear of pain?
I have here the exclusive secretly-made poison from West Sea, the Suffocated Donkey.
With no color or smell, no trace or clue, no pain or itch, your problems will be solved before you know it.
The price yesterday was 988, and today it is only 688.
Pay 688 and you can have it.
Fast, fast.
Here.
688.
This old codger never cease to surprise me.
Give me money.
See.
He is bent on money again.
Take it yourself.
You guys.
I have finally found you.
Did you see the clue I left for you?
You saw...
Yes.
The clue.
Saw it.
You saw it?
Congratulations, Zhang.
You have found a new direction in life.
Promising future of wealth.
I'm mainly doing this for intelligence gathering, right?
The business is only sideline.
I have something important I need to tell you.
Here.
Let's talk over there.
Right, let's talk over there.
Let's go.
Let's go.
You haven't paid the money.
Look, the King of Pirates Convention is tomorrow.
I'm not ready yet.
How should I make my appearance?
I'm not done.
North Sea Yama has secretly imprisioned Tu Gedong.
It seems that there's going to be a public interrogation tomorrow on the convention.
And he will discuss with the other four kings about how to invade the new land.
If we want to rescue Tu Gedong, tomorrow is our only chance.
The top priority for now is to figure out how we can sneak into the convention.
It is too hard.
The King of Pirates Convention is the biggest gathering in the pirate circle.
The grandstand tickets were sold out even the five kings of North Sea and their minions haven't arrived.
Such a brisk business.
What did you say?
Such a brisk business.
No, the sentence before that.
The grandstand tickets were sold out.
The one before that.
The five kings of North Sea and their minions haven't arrived.
[Beautiful-voice dancers]
On the endless waters, if there is one glimmer of hope left, that must be our Senluo Sea Market.
We drifted about, fought against all.
It is the pirates' turn to come on the stage of the world.
Welcome the fifth king, North Sea Rakshasa.
He is in charge of the excavating and mining of all the coals and minerals used for steam power.
He is the myth of earth in charge of the world of pirates.
[North Sea Rakshasa]
Welcome the fourth king,
North Sea Impermanence.
Thanks to the gunpowder developed by her, we have the capabilities to invade and plunder by firearms.
She is the one to build the fire glory of the world of pirates.
[North Sea Impermanence]
Welcome the third king,
North Sea Mengpo.
Smells so good.
He is responsible to extract and offer the source of life in our daily life.
He is the Shura of water dominating the pirates' world.
[North Sea Mengpo]
Let's welcome the second king,
North Sea Judge.
He is proficient in making ships by wood, and controls the maritime transport.
Without him, all the pirates are in difficulty while sailing.
He is the chief of wood dominating our pirates' world.
[North Sea Judge]
Everyone, let's welcome our king,
North Sea Yama.
He makes all the currency we use to trade .
One of his words can throw the world into turmoil.
One cannot live if he wants him dead.
He'll not be absolved from the sins even in the hell.
He is the legend of gold dominating the pirates' world.
[North Sea Yama]
The five kings are here.
I declare the Pirates Convention begins officially.
Good. Good. Good.
Pour wine for our brother. Refill it.
Brother, a toast for you.
Never ming them.
The breaking news
I'm going to declare will rewrite the history of the world, and restructure the global situation.
There is going to be a brand new world dominated by us pirates in the future.
I've got the sea map of the new land.
Sea map?
He is going to be our guide and leads us to the new land.
The new land!
The new land!
Here comes the wine.
Come on. Hurry up!
Here.
Fetch the wine.
Here. Pour it.
Pour it.
In the name of the King of Pirates,
I command you to follow me to the new land.
Wish us success through all the wind and waves to conquer the new land.
Cheers!
Cheers!
Cheers!
Cheers!
Cheers!
Cheers!
Come on.
Refill it!
Drink!
The wine is strong enough!
Good job!
Well done.
Let me pour the wine for you!
Drink the wine.
What's wrong with you dumb?
I don't know, either.
Cheers, girls.
Pour the wine.
[Specified List of August Sulphur Saltpeter]
[Specified List of November Sulphur Saltpeter]
Boss
What's wrong?
Laosi, she earned a lot of dirty money, but she didn't share it with you.
It's true.
Brother,
I have something to say.
We can't take North Sea Impermanence with us during this expedition.
She is an unfaithful and perfidious bitch!
What's the fuck you are talking about?
I'll shoot you at once!
What?
What?
Have a try?
Try it!
Try it!
What?
Try it!
Sijie.
Laosi, have you forgot about the rules?
Let him finish first.
Brother,
I've treated her as my brother, but she always tries to entrap me.
These years the price of sulphur and saltpeter has risen by dozens of times in the market.
She has never mentioned the increase, but denies that the raw ore and extractant are two different conception.
You, how much does she owe me?
200 ships in the last 10 years.
20 tons each ship.
According to market price, a ton costs 7,890.33 belly, so she needs to make up for the price difference by 23,561,320
Belly.
That's right!
24 million.
Don't blame me for being malicious if you don't pay today.
Your base would have been destroyed by the Coastguard Commission without my protection.
You need to pay the protection money!
I pay the shipping cost of raw material every year.
Do you have any conscience?
What are you saying?
Wait.
I...
Shipping cost?
Laowu,
I've never received any shipping cost.
So you use my ships for free?
Free?
Stop now.
Drop it!
Erge, we can talk about it later.
We can spilt the money half and half after I get it.
Perfect!
Give me my money!
Don't change the topic!
Don't change the topic!
You jerks with evil mind!
I've hated to see you guys for a long time!
I cannot bear the sight of you!
Get out!
What?
This sissy is annoying!
Shameless! Hit him!
I cannot bear the sight of you!
What did you say?
You filthy sissy!
What are you doing?
Hit him!
What did you say?
I will beat your ass!
Hit him!
Look, brother.
Shut up!
It's alright.
Sit down.
Anyone else who broke the rules?
Talk!
Brother.
Brother.
Brother.
He's bleeding.
Come to stop the bleeding now.
This bitch is afraid of the disclosure and being caught.
You did this?
Who did it?
It's her!
What did you say?
Murder!
Murder!
What did you say?
Erge.
You did want to kill me!
The wine is poisonous.
The wine is poisonous.
It's poisonous.
You sissy!
I didn't do it.
Let's go.
Go go go.
Hurry up.
Easy.
What is that?
Knockout drops.
Let's go.
I moored the Black Widow at the port in advance.
What about the crew?
We are on our own from now on.
Cheers!
Cheers!
Next stop, the new land.
It's a pity our sea map has been left at the Senluo Sea Market.
It doesn't matter.
I've studied it for my entire life.
The sea map is already in my mind.
You do know about the map!
The wine is a gift given by a captain when I was at Caribbean.
This is all that have been left.
I will share with you guys since we are so cheerful.
I've learned this eye make-up from him.
You acted well this time.
You live up to your name as the Commissioner of Coastguard Commission
I did all these things because of my families.
All businessmen are profiteers. Right?
But this time
I truly treat you as my brothers.
Can I call you brothers?
Interesting.
Now the coastguards and pirates are brothers.
This is insane!
We've been through death together.
Of course we are brothers.
How about this?
We three become sworn brothers?
OK.
How's that?
OK.
Good.
Listen to my command.
OK.
What's our relationship?
Brothers!
How do we drink it?
Bottoms up!
Good wine.
Come on. Let me do this.
That's enough.
It's quite strong, don't drink too much.
Let m do it..
Just one sip.
How come there is still some left?
No, that's all left.
There must be more. Give me.
Refill it.
There is little left.
I'll drink it.
Don't spill it.
Don't worry. I won't.
I'm your brother, too.
Do they look good?
Yes.
Yes?
That's enough.
Don't be endless day by day.
I tell you, she is going to be you sister-in-law.
It might be hard for you to go after her.
Hai Ji is not mean to be a normal woman.
I knew that.
She has been my life since the day she was willing to sacrifice her life for me.
I will set sail if she wants to set sail.
I will be her stepping-stone if she wants to be a queen.
I'll be her side all the time, and be her chief mate even if she marries to someone else in the end.
That is the way how I love her.
You have love in your heart, and you dare to love and hate.
You are a real man.
Mr. Tu, what are you...
Nothing.
People love to reminisce about the past when they are old.
Once
Luo Dayong and I were good brothers like them.
Once
I had a daughter, a beautiful and kind little girl
probably like you.
I wouldn't have been mad for years if she were still here.
Love sometimes makes men mad.
Mr. Tu,
I believe your daughter will feel your love no matter where she is.
Maybe she will feel it soon.
[The New Land]
The new land.
This is the new land.
This?
This?
Isn't it a deserted island?
It's impossible.
My research can't be wrong.
It is here according to the sea map.
Let's land on the island and explore it first.
We can discuss it later.
Let's go.
Look, the Black Coffins.
Isn't it a deserted island?
[Wanhai Tong]
How come there is the newspaper of Wanhai Tong of a year ago?
It can only explain the real murderer of the the Black Coffin case might be on the island.
How come there is an artificial building on the deserted island?
Let's go.
Let's have a look there.
Hurry up.
Go.
Tell me.
Who on earth are you?
Luo Li, what's wrong with you?
He is Tu.
You are the only one who knows about the sea map.
What do you want by guiding us here all the way?
Who the hell are you?
Who am I?
Haven't you known about that?
Why?
Why did you do that?
Do you still remember the story I once told you?
In fact, the hero of it wasn't Luo Dayong, but me.
At that time, my daughter was dying.
In order to save her,
I did an experiment on her privately.
Shasha.
Dad, I feel so bad.
However, there was a mutation.
She became a monster.
I had no choice but to seal her in a Petri dish.
[Evolution Plan]
Later,
I did the experiment on you secretly.
I had not expected that you could integrate with the reagent perfectly and produce antibodies automatically.
You were all the hope for curing my daughter.
However, after Luo Dayong discovered it, he destroyed all of it.
So you're the real culprit of the Black Coffin case.
There isn't the new land at all.
Right.
I did all these things just for attracting you here.
As for them, they're just the supporting roles I've arranged.
The purpose is to make the show of looking for the new land more real.
Now it's time to finish the show.
Old man, if you dare to act rashly,
I'll kill you.
Otherwise I am not the Sea Bottle.
Tu, calm down.
I can give all my money to you so that your daughter can receive the best treatment.
If your daughter knows that your love is so ruthless,
I'm afraid she won't be willing to wake up.
You can't understand the pain a father has to suffer after losing his daughter.
For her sake,
I can bear all the sins.
I'm willing to save your daughter with my own blood, as long as you let go of them.
Luo Li.
Luo Li.
Each of us is like a small piece of dirt.
Only when all these pieces of dirt connect with each other, it's truly a new land.
Really?
Yes.
Okay.
I trust you.
You know what?
I really appreciate your telling me about all these things.
It turns out that my father was a good man.
From your words, I could feel his existence,
his conduct and his love for me.
So it's enough for me to have known about these things.
I believe his love for me
was the same as yours to your daughter.
So
I'm willing to save your daugther with my own blood.
No.
No, Luo Li.
As long as you let go of them.
You might die by doing this.
Sorry.
Maybeâ¦
I mean, maybe.
If the antibodies in your blood is strong enough,
maybe both of you can survive.
Luo Li.
How are you?
We meet again.
I've made so much effort to find you.
Say it.
Where's the new land?
Well, haven'tâ¦ haven't you found it?
Here is the new land.
You can hardly stay longer when your god is calling on you.
Don't worry. I'm here.
It's time to show my true power.
I won't disgrace you.
Idiot.
Kill them all except for that old man.
Yes.
Hai Ji.
Bottle.
Bottle.
Bottle.
Bottle.
How are you?
Don't cry.
I can't stand it if you cry.
It's worth it if I can die for you.
Before I die, could you
kiss me?
Luo Li.
Shasha.
Just wait.
I'll come back again.
Luo Li.
Are you all right?
Look.
Thanks.
I've caused you all the trouble.
But you still returned good for evil like this.
Luo Li, thank you for doing all these things.
It's all over.
Luckily, everyone is fine.
Bottle.
Bottle.
Bottle.
Bottle.
Bottle.
Bottle.
Bottle.
What's wrong with you?
You're faking death again, aren't you?
Bottle.
I've told you many times.
It's not funny at all.
If you do this again,
I'll be very very very angry.
Bottle, hang in there.
Bottle.
I'll be so angry that I won't forgive you all my life.
Did you hear it?
Did you hear it?
Did you hear it?
Bottle.
I heard it.
It's good if you won't forgive me.
Then will you remember me all your life?
Do you still remember what I said to you in the cabin that night?
Yes, I do.
Though the story was false, and the lines were fabricated,
I love you.
My love for you
is true.
I'm sorry.
I've caused you all the trouble and Sea Bottle even died because of me.
What a terrible mistake I've made.
I'm not worthy of being a human.
Bottle, wake up.
If I could, please let me repent of and atone forâ¦
Bottle.
Bottle.
â¦my sin in the rest of my life.
Bottle.
Bottle.
Bottle.
Bottle.
Bottle. Bottle.
Bottle.
Bottle.
Bottle.
Bottle.
Bottle.
Bottle.
I only want to spend the rest of my life with you.
Cry and laugh with you.
Go to the ends of the earth with you.
See the sunrise and sunset with you every day, and the ebb and flow.
Your world could be without me.
But in my world, there's only you.
That's the last thing I wish for during the last minutes of my life.
Bottle,
I'll go on living with your will.
I'll also find the new land and help your Hai Ji and your buddies settle down.
I won't allow the loss of any of us again.

The End
Following its first projection, the film "Metropolis" was considerably shortened and modified.
More than 25% of the original film was regarded as lost.
In 2008, an almost complete copy was found in Buenos Aires.
The print was seriously deteriorated and the image partly truncated because of the copy's 16-mm format.
This version contains new scenes and made it possible to correct the order of sequences.
The Spanish inter-titles were recreated.
A black edge was applied where the image is truncated to fit the 16-mm format.
The lost parts essential to the comprehension of the plot are summarized by titles in a modern font. The intertitles appear in their original style.
The shorter missing sections are marked with black frames.
Shift change.
Down below the Earth's surface the workers' city.
As deep as lay the workers' city below the earth,
So high above it towered the complex club named the "Club of the Sons," with its lecture halls and libraries, its theaters and stadiums
Fathers for whom every revolution of a machine wheel meant gold had created for their sons the miracle of the Eternal Gardens
Which of you ladies shall today have the honor of entertaining Master Freder, Jon Fredersen's son?"
Look! These are your brothers!
Look!
These are your brothers!"
Who was that?"
But this is what happened to Freder son of Joh Fredersen, master of Metropolis!
when he went in search of the girl:
To the new Tower of Babel! To my father!"
Why is it, Josaphat, that I learn of the explosion from my son, and not from you!"
The details!"
What were you doing in the machine halls, Freder?"
I wanted to see the faces of the people whose children are my brothers and sisters"
Your marvelous city, father, and you the city's brain and all of us the city's light"
And where are the people, Father, whose hands built your city?"
Where they belong"
Where they belong?"
in the depths?"
What if one day those in the depths rise up against you?"
The chief foreman of the Heart Machine, Grot with an important message"
Two more of those damned plans, Mr. Fredersen"
in the pockets of two men involved in today's accident at the M-Machine"
Why is it, Josaphat, that these plans were brought to me by Grot, and not by you?"
Apply to the G-Bank for your remaining wages"
Father, do you know what it means to be dismissed by you? It means: Go below!
Into the depths!"
Do you know what it means to be dismissed like that by Jon Fredersen?"
Do you want to work for me, Josaphat?"
I still have a long way to go tonight"
Into the depths, to be with my brothers"
Beginning today I wish to be kept informed of every step my son takes"
Someone h a s to stay at the machine!"
Someone w i l l stay at the machine" ME."
I want to trade lives with you!"
Wait for me, both of you"
In the heart of Metropolis there was a strange house, overlooked by the centuries.
The man who lived in it was Rotwang, the inventor.
Lost to Joh Fredersen.
Died giving birth to Freder, Joh Fredersen's son.
A brain like yours, Rotwang, should be able to forget." Only once in my life did I forget anything:
that Hel was a woman, and you a man"
For you, as for me, she is dead"
Do you think that losing a hand is too high a price to pay for re-creating Hel? ! "Do you want to see her?"
Isn't it worth the loss of a hand to have created the man of the future? the MACHINE-Man?
!"
Give me another 24 hours, and no one, Joh Fredersen, no one will be able to tell a Machine-Man from a mortal!"
The son of Hel was yours!"
As usual, when my experts fail me, I come to you for advice"
What do they mean?"
Will ten hours never end? !"
it is a plan of the 2000-year-old catacombs deep below the lowest level of your Metropolis"
I should like to know what my workers are doing in the catacombs."
Today I will tell you the legend of the TOWER OF BABEL"
And on the top of the tower we will write the words:
Great is the World and its Creator! And Great is Man!"
The task was too great. So they hired hands for wages.
But the hands that build the Tower of Babel knew nothing of the dream of the brain that had conceived it.
THE MEDIATOR BETWEEN HEAD AND HANDS MUST BE THE HEART!"
You called me. Here I am!"
I shall destroy their belief in this woman"
Freder sees a monk in the pulpit who preaches:
Verily, I say unto you, the days spoken of in the Apocalypse are nigh!"
The monk's hand points to the Bible, in which is written:
And I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet colored beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns"
And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet color, having a golden cup in her hand
And upon her forehead was a name written, mystery, Babylon the Great, the mother of abominations of the earth."
You will destroy Joh Fredersen him and his city and his son!"
If you had come earlier, you wouldn't have scared me.
But now I beg you: Stay away from me and my beloved!"
Where is he, whose clothes you wear?"
Will you please wake Georgy?
He must take me at once to the Worker's City"
No. 11811, you will return to your machine and forget that you ever left it understand?"
I must have someone who is loyal to me, Josaphat.
how else can I reach the end of my Journey? !"
I must continue, Josaphat
I must now look only to the People, to whom Georgy pointed the way ..."
This evening, Josaphat this evening, when I return..."
So, what price do you ask in order to leave this house this evening?"
You do not seem to have understood, on whose behalf I am here"
This man does not wish that his son be found here this evening!"
In three hours I'll come for you!"
It is time to give the Machine-Man your face!"
Where is Maria? !"
She is with your father"
I tell you, she is with your father!"
She is the most perfect and obedient tool that ever a man possessed!
Tonight you'll see, as she is unveiled before the eyes of the top hundred.
You'll see her dancing...
C.A. Rotwang requests Joh Fredersen to be his guest this evening.
I want you to visit those in the depths, in order to destroy the work of the woman in whose image you were created!"
C.A. Rotwang requests Joh Frederson to be his guest this evening.
Verily, I say unto you, the days spoken of in the Apocalypse are nigh!"
Death descends upon the city!"
The Book of Revelations
I put on this disguise to escape from the Thin Man But for ten days your father's spy has been making even the workers' city risky"
The only thing keeping the workers in check is that they still wait for the Mediator that was promised to them"
More strange things have happened, Freder"
once the best of friends were, because of that woman"
the other man the same evening"
The Eternal Gardens lie abandoned, but night after night in Yoshiwara"
And this woman, at whose feet all sins are heaped"
The same woman who those in the depths look up to as a saint?
Many now go to the City of the Dead, to a woman who has proven herself as true as gold."
But the mediator must not be missing!"
Whatever happens tonight, it is my express orders to let the workers do as they will"
Joh Fredersen wants to let those in the depths use force and do wrong,
When you spoke to your poor brothers, you spoke of peace, Maria
She will destroy their belief in a mediator!"
You know that I have always spoken of peace, but your mediator has not come"
You have waited long enough!
but I have tricked Joh Fredersen!
Who is the living food for the machines in Metropolis?
Who lubricates the machine joints with their own blood?
Who feeds the machines with their own flesh?
Let the machines starve, you fools!
Let them die!" "Kill them the machines!"
Maria speaks of peace, not killing!
Joh Fredersen's son!"
Kill him, the dog, in his white silken fur!"
Get your women, your sons, from the workers' city!
In the attic with Maria, Rotwang grows ever more intoxicated by his triumph over Fredersen.
and I tricked Joh Fredersen twice over!
For I concealed from him that his son wants to be your brothers' mediator and loves you!"
Maria is not the only one listening to Rotwang.
Outside the attic window Joh Fredersen has been eavesdropping Joh Fredersen breaks into Rotwang's attic.
He battles with his old rival, overcoming him.
faithful after all"
Women and men, let no one miss today!
None, none remained behind!"
Don't touch the machines!
I said, open the gates!"
If the Heart-Machine is destroyed, the entire machine district will end up in ruins."
Have you gone mad?
If the Heart-Machine is destroyed, the entire workers' city will flood!"
Where are you fathers, your mothers?"
Do you know that your son is among the workers?"
Yes You!

To the air shafts, quickly!
Quickly!
The reservoirs have burst! The city is flooding!"
We'll take the children to the Club of the Sons!"

Tomorrow thousands will ask in fury and desperation, Joh Fredersen, where is my son!
Where are your children?
The city lies underwater, the shafts are completely flooded!"
Who told you to attack the machines, you idiots?
Without them you'll all die!"

Paul Maurand
A Woman Passed By
A woman passed by  crushing underfoot the feelings and desires of her worshippers...
Sowing hatred and envy in her wake...
Unhappy and misunderstood, she goes on toward her inescapable destiny  which will never be the path of happiness...
La Feria ! ...
a cafe-nightclub  the haunt of boatmen, sailors, passing dockhands...
Look !
It's Concha !
Concha... a dancer...
All sensuality, all desire summed up in a smile  her man...
A regular at La Feria...
Jean-Marie Grignard - ... master of the Mouette, a barge that regularly plies "The Canal".
 Why don't you come live with me on the Mouette  You'll be happy... "
... In a week and a half... I'll be back... "
Pierre le Roulier, adopted as a child by Jean-Marie  now a grown man.
Gertrude the housekeeper, present when the Mouette was launched  who remains the sole female presence on board.
The soup is ready ! ... Come and eat..."
Faster !"
FASTER !"
 Flog the nags ! ... "
A RAID
Just then, the Mouette arrived in port.
 We're staying here a few days.
I have some business to take care of. "
 Do you still mean what you said ? "
And the next day, in the morning mist  Jean-Marie brought Concha to the Mouette.
 Harness the horses... we have to get out of here...
 That's an order ! "
... and a new life began on board...
 We have to pay the Mouette's passage through the locks. "
And life became calm again...
The Mouette carried on its perpetual to and fro  between the ports of the North and the South.
... And the days rolled by in monotony  along the ribbon of grey water that was the "Canal".
Little by little, Concha was gripped by nostalgia for her cafe-nightclub  her life  her affairs.
 Look at her, dancing while we work.
It would be a whole lot better if she'd help us... "
Not long after, the barge returned to its port of origin.
 Tomorrow is the end of our voyage  and it's the anniversary of the old Mouette's launching. "
 Meet me tonight at midnight, near the old lighthouse... "
 During the party we're having tomorrow  I've got a big surprise in store for you. "
And the night before the party  Jean-Marie busied himself with mysterious preparations.
... After midnight, Concha and Pierre left the quiet banks of the Canal  and found themselves on the coast of the stormy Ocean.
Tomorrow... after the party... We have to run away... "
 To run away...
we'll need money... Do you have any ? "
RETURN TO TOWN
... Violent passion, burning enthusiasm  and as the party begins  Jean-Marie goes to great lengths to stage "his surprise"...
The surprise.
 And now let's christen the other Concha !
 When a barge is christened for the second time  they say it's a sign of bad luck."
And now, on to the dance !
As night fell, the wine flowed freely  the couples spun about  the party was at its height.
 We'll run away at once..."
 Do you have the money ?"
 In an hour wait for me on the bridge of the Mouette.
I'll have lots of money  We can run away... "
... And in the young man's fevered brain  a furious struggle erupted...
 We'll hide out tonight at the Hotel Trianon. "
The Hotel Trianon.
Refuge of the occasional transient  and motorists in a jam.
The owner, who combines the functions of hotel manager  room valet and cook.
The Viscount de Tanaris, known throughout the world  for his entertaining escapades.
 Fix the car tonight  we leave tomorrow morning at 11:00. "
 Do you know that pretty girl ? "
 Where have they gone ? "
 They're hiding out at the Hotel Trianon... "
 In one hour we'll be headed for the border. "
 Someone is inquiring for Madame...
Would Madame care to come down ? "
 What have you done with my Concha ? "
With my wife ? "
... several days went by...
THE CIRCUS
Swing Little Girl, Swing, high, to the sky,
And don't ever look at the ground,
If you're looking for rainbows, Look up, to the sky,
You'll never find rainbows, If you're looking down,
Life maybe be dreary, But never the same,
Some day, it's sunshine Some day, it's rain,
Swing Little Girl, Swing high, to the sky,
And don't ever look to the ground,
If you're looking for rainbows, Look up to the sky,
But never, no never, look down...
THE CIRCUS
So you missed the hoop again."
Father, I couldn't help it."
For that you don't eat tonight."
And you're supposed to be funny!"
Look at that house; empty!"
Around the Side Shows hungry and broke.
Here you are, sir."
Count it."
Is it all there?"
Say, gimme that money!"
How d'you get out of here?"
Rotten!"
Get off!"
Where's the funny man?"
Bring on the funny man!"
The Funny Man.
Meal-time after the Show.
Father won't let me."
Do you want a job?"
Be here in the morning, and we'll try you out."
Early the next morning.
Hungry.
Run along home!"
I live here."
Excuse me, my cane."
The Tryout.
Go ahead and be funny."
That's awful!"
Put on the William Tell act."
Now then, watch this and see if you can do it."
Go ahead and try it."
Put on the barber-shop act."
Now I must hit you."
Now hit me!"
I can't see."
Just a moment!"
We haven't talked terms yet."
Get out and stay out!"
Show's starting!"
Aren't you coming in?"
You're not leaving?"
You see, we couldn't come to terms."
Thank you for the egg."
The Show on.
Trouble with the Property Men.
How about our back pay?"
Get to work!"
We quit!"
They've quit."
Get anybody!"
Do you want a job?"
Don't touch that button!"
He's a sensation, but he doesn't know it, Keep him on as a property man."
The Circus prospered, but not the property man; and the girl led the same hard life.
Keep him busy and don't let him know he's the hit of the show."
A Sick Horse.
Blow this pill down the horse's neck!"
The horse blew first —"
Open the door, quick!"
I told you the lions were dangerous!"
Where's that pill?"
Come here!"
I've got to see a doctor!"
It's a shame the way they make you work — — and you the hit of the show."
Why of course! All the crowds, all the applause is just for you."
I knew it!"
If you strike that girl, I'll quit!"
And what's more I want what I'm worth —"
I'll give you fifty dollars a week."
Sixty!"
I'll double it!"
Nothing less than a hundred."
The Next Show.
The success of the Tramp made life easier for the girl and himself.
Oh, Merna, you must have your fortune told!"
I see love and marriage with a dark, handsome man who is near you now."
A New Added Attraction, Rex, a tight-rope walker.
Pardon me."
Go right ahead."
I'll give you Five Dollars for it."
It's happened; I'm in love!"
He's a tight-rope walker; I've just met him."
Hurry up, you're on!"
The Act Over.
What's the matter?
You hardly got a laugh!"
This is my friend."
I don't like tight-rope walkers."
Time brought many changes to the Circus;
New Hopes and New Ambitions.
His New Ambition.
Never mind the rope; You'd better try and be funny again or you'll go!"
The next performance– and not a smile.
I've had enough of this; you get one more chance."
Where's Rex?"
Rex, the tight-rope walker, hasn't shown up."
Is Rex here?"
You can do the act, can't you?"
You'll do it or quit!"
I'll do it; find his clothes!"
There's the clothes!"
You follow her!"
He'll kill himself."
That's all right; I've got him insured."
Take your time, there's another act to go on."
Why, what is the meaning of this?"
I am taking his place on the rope."
You'll get killed."
Oh, no, I have a charmed life."
I'll give you five dollars if you'll do it."
Not a word to anybody."
Please don't do this."
You've forgotten your tights."
You're on!"
You're through!"
That Night.
I've run away from the circus."
I'll never go back."
Can't you take me with you?"
I've got an idea."
You stay here."
Have you seen Merna?"
She's run away —"
I can do nothing for her — —"
Now, there's one way out."
She's there now?"
Take me to her!"
The Next Morning.
The Circus ready to leave.
So you've come back — You — !"
You're speaking to my wife!"
Will you go on with the show?"
— — if you take him."
The end wagon for you."
Come in with us."
The End Fixed  Synced by @masih_mzsh
THE PASSION OF JOAN OF ARC
In Paris, the library of the Chamber of Deputies holds one of the most extraordinary documents in the history of the world:
the minutes of the trial of Joan of Arc, a trial which ended in her sentencing and death.
In it, the judges' questions and Joan's answers are meticulously recorded.
Reading it, we discover Joan as she really was.
Not the Joan in helmet and armor, but simple and human.
A young woman who died for her country.
We witness an astounding drama:
a young, deeply religious woman attacked by a horde of blinded theologians and experienced lawyers.
I swear to tell the truth, the whole truth... nothing but the truth.
In France, they call me Joan.
In my village, they called me Joanie.
How old are you?
Nineteen.
I think.
Do you know the Lord's Prayer?
Who taught it to you?
My mother.
Would you recite the Lord's Prayer?
You claim to have been sent by God?
To save France.
That's why I was born.
So you think God hates the English?
I know nothing of God's love or hatred for the English... but I know the English will all soon be driven out of France... except those who die here!
You said Saint Michael appeared to you.
What did he look like?
Did he have wings?
Was he wearing a crown?
How was he dressed?
How could you know if it was a man or a woman?
Was he naked?
Do you think God is unable to clothe him?
Did he have long hair?
Why would he have cut it?
Why do you wear men's clothes?
If we give you women's clothes, will you wear them?
When the mission God gave me is finished,
I will wear women's clothes again.
So it was God who commanded you to wear men's clothes?
And what reward do you hope to gain from Our Lord?
The salvation of my soul.
You blaspheme God.
This is disgraceful.
To me, she is a saint.
Did God promise you anything?
That has nothing to do with your trial.
Shouldn't we let the judges decide that?
Would you like to put it to a vote?
Well, then!
What did God promise you?
Perhaps he told you you'd be freed from prison?
When?
I know neither the day... nor the hour.
She doesn't want to make a confession, so we must use wiles to get it.
Fetch a letter bearing King Charles's signature.
I will dictate the letter.
I have such compassion for you!
Can you recognize your king's signature?
I have a letter from him for you.
I don't know how to read.
To our dear, beloved Joan...
I make ready to march upon Rouen with a great army.
I send you this devoted priest.
Trust him."
As Jesus is God's son, do you consider yourself God's daughter?
Now will you recite the Lord's Prayer?
Did God tell you you'd be freed from prison?
Yes, through a great victory!
Did God promise you'd go to heaven?
So you are certain of your salvation?
Be careful, that's a dangerous answer.
So if you are sure of your salvation, you have no need of the Church?
Are you in a state of grace?
Well, now!
Answer! Are you in a state of grace?
If I am, may God keep me there.
If I am not, may God bestow His grace upon me!
Sir... allow me to hear Mass.
Joan, if we allow you to hear Mass... will you lay aside your men's clothes?
So you prefer your men's clothes to hearing Mass?
That immodest garb... abominable to God.
You are no daughter of God.
You are a servant of Satan!
Prepare the torture.
She sure looks like a daughter of God.
In the torture chamber.
Look at your judges.
Are not these learned doctors of the Church wiser than you?
But God is wiser still!
Listen, Joan, we know your revelations do not come from God... but from the devil.
How do you tell a good angel from a bad angel?
You kneeled before Satan, not Saint Michael!
Don't you see it's the devil who has confused you... tricked you... and betrayed you?
I think she's ready to sign the letter of abjuration!
The Church opens its arms to you.
If you refuse, the Church will abandon you and you will be alone.
Alone!
Yes, alone.
Alone with God!
Even if you tear my soul from my body, I will renounce nothing.
And if I do say anything, afterward, I'll say you forced it out of me!
She must not die a natural death.
She is very weak.
She is feverish.
She must be bled.
Be careful, she could kill herself.
She's very cunning.
Get the Sacraments.
You have nothing to say to us?
I fear I'm in great danger of dying... and if I do, I ask to be buried in holy ground.
The Church is merciful.
It always welcomes its lost sheep.
Joan, we all want to help you.
You see, I've sent for the Holy Sacrament.
I am a good Christian.
Don't you know that what you refuse is the Body of Christ?
Can't you see that you offend God with your stubbornness?
I love and honor God with all my heart.
You say that I am sent by the devil.
That is not true.
It is you who are sent by the devil to make me suffer.
And you.
And you.
And you.
There's nothing left to do.
Summon the executioner!
For the last time, let us try to save this lost soul.
I'm speaking to you, Joan.
And I tell you your king is a heretic!
My king is the most noble of all Christians.
This woman's arrogance is outrageous.
Never has France seen such a monster.
I never hurt anyone.
If you don't sign, you'll be burned alive.
Look, the executioner awaits.
You don't have the right to die. Your king still needs your help.
Joan, sign...
and save your life!
Joan, we have such pity for you.
Sign, Joan!
In the Lord's name. Amen.
As you have admitted your errors, we free you from the bonds of excommunication.
But because you have rashly sinned, we condemn you... to perpetual imprisonment with the bread of sorrow and the water of affliction.
You have done well this day: You have saved your life and your soul.
She made fools of you!
Long live Joan!
Fetch the judges!
I repent. I lied.
Hurry!
I've done something very bad.
I betrayed God to save my life.
But, Joan, before the people you admitted you'd been led by the devil.
So you still believe you are God's chosen one?
That answer is her death sentence.
I only confessed out of fear of the flames.
Do you have anything else to tell us?
We have come to prepare you for death.
Is it time... already?
How am I to die?
At the stake.
I'll get the viaticum.
Tell me, how can you still believe you were sent by God?
God moves in mysterious ways.
Yes, I am His child.
And the great victory?
My martyrdom!
And your freedom?
Death!
Do you wish to make confession?
RELAPSED HERETIC, APOSTATE, IDOLATER
Joan, be brave. Your last hour is near.
Sweet God, I accept death gladly... but don't let me suffer too long.
Will I be with You tonight in paradise?
Jesus!
You have burned a saint!
The protective flames surrounded Joan's soul as she rose to heaven.
Joan, whose heart has become the heart of France.
Joan, whose memory will be honored by the French forever.

BANNEC.
On an island where winter storms wipe out all forms of life... four men come in two teams to spend the summer collecting seaweed in total isolation
There should be one or two bottles left in my trunk.
If you want to share a toast..."
You broke my last bottle of plonk!
Give me my knife back, at least!"
There is no source at Bannec.
The only cistern, which collects rain water... is a constant worry for the four solitary men.
At daybreak, when the tide is low, Ambroise starts his gathering... at one of those thousands of reefs that make the sea so dangerous here
This morning, Ambroise's arm feels weak and has none of the usual skill.
Jean-Marie, on the other hand, is already back with a huge crop.
The seaweed should be spread and partly dried in the sun before being burned.
The harvest season only lasts 3 months.
Ambroise's companion is worried...
This laziness must come to an end !
The drought goes on and the water cistern sinks to an alarming level.
With the evening comes some rest.
Are you mad? You use drinking water to wash your hands ?
... You think you can get away with such girlish behavior here ?"
As you let me down and went to work for Jean-Marie, he'll have to feed you!
Feverish and helpless, Ambroise considers going back to his home at Ouessant... where there is a doctor.
Ambroise gathers all his force to raise the sail with his only working arm...
But the dead calm makes the trip impossible without rowing.
Ouessant, which is separated from Bannec by the difficult Fromveur passage... is the biggest and mildest of the islands of the archipelago.
Jean-Marie's mother would never have dared to put on her headdress again... if she had missed the daily mass
but she was on very bad terms with her neighbor, Ambroise's mother.
Malgorn, one of the guardians of the Menn-Tenn-Sell lighthouse... finally has his turn of ten days to spend on land
Something's strange on Bannec...
Today none of the boats parted." Only one oven smoking the last 2 days...
The devoted doctor Lesenn is the youngest islanders' best friend, despite his 67 years.
The locals all have a deep affection for him, based on respect and gratitude.
The guardian of Stiff, the lighthouse north-east of the island, agrees :
There is surely something strange going on on Bannec..."
Faced with the Register of Sailors, this people consisting of widows, orphans, parents who lost their sons, is swift at reacting.
Mothers, daughters, seamen's wives, the Ouessant women are fearsome....
They try to perceive Bannec
Doctor Lesenn !
Only he can do it..."
Yes, it's disquieting...
When the tide allows, I'll try to get to Bannec."
Ambroise !
I found my knife !
Ambroise, we were wrong... listen !"
Pierre, we can't just sit here and watch him suffer like this...
We must get him to Ouessant..."
Not saying against..
But how to traverse the Fromveur in this dead calm...
With 4 men rowing we won't manage to go up the stream..."
Come on children, we need yet another sailor to get to Bannec...
The fog, most dangerous of enemies...
The semaphore flag signals VARIABLE wind.
At daybreak.
But on the other side of the island, an old man is sick... and calling for help from the good doctor.
The end.
The scorpion is an arachnid species found in various parts of the world.
Its tail comprises five prismatic joints.
The pincers, recalling those of the larger crayfish are instruments of aggression and information.
Its tail ends in a sixth joint, a sac from which poison is injected by barbed sting.
A lover of darkness, it burrows under stones to escape the glare of the sun.
Antisocial, it ejects the intruder on its solitude.
Such lightning strikes, such virtuosity in attack. Even a rat, for all its fury, falls prey to it.
Some hours later...
Stop it.
Perhaps I just happened to fall?
We saw nothing.
Is there any news, yes or no?
Yes, the Majorcans are here.
Quick, to arms.
To the rear.
What about Péman?
I'm done for.
So are we, but we're going.
Yes, but you've got accordions, hippopotamuses, wrenches, mountain goats, and...
Nonsense.
Let's go.
...and paintbrushes.
This stone, on the site where the Majorcans died, marks the founding of the city of Imperial Rome.
Once mistress of the pagan world, now secular seat of the Church.
Aspects of its stoutest pillar, the Vatican.
The landlord's terms are very favourable.
We can move in at once. Longing to see you, very soon now.
Your loving cousin.
But the hurly-burly of modern life has overtaken the Imperial City.
Sometimes on Sundays...
Various picturesque aspects of the great city.
Bandaged?
Yes, it's been sore for over a week.
Is father home yet, mother?
Yes, he's in the dispensary.
Then he'll dress for the party.
We went out together this morning and engaged four of them.
The little moustached one sang like the rest.
Only a pianist is lacking.
But our priest is a fine violinist.
I think the musicians we have will be enough.
Six of them placed near the microphone will make more noise than sixty ten kilometres away.
I know sound fades in the open air but we could bring the guests in close.
Get a move on.
The Majorcans will be arriving at nine.
Scroundrel.
Filthy swine.
Keep your mouth shut.
Do you want a beating?
You're certainly asking for it.
Enough. Let me show you who you're dealing with.
Let's have a look, then.
The International Goodwill Society hereby appoints you its special delegate.
This document testifies to our faith in you.
We pray that you will prove worthy of this trust we place in you, and successfully complete your goodwill mission.
On your spirit of self-sacrifice and your proven valour depend many lives.
Children, women, old men
The honour of our Fatherland
Rests on the outcome of this noble enterprise
At his magnificent Roman estate, the Marquis of X prepares for his guests.
The Minister of the Interior is on the telephone.
You are entirely to blame.
You compromised me, too.
Do you realise that not one child survived?
Many women and old men perished, too.
You're bothering me about a few scamps?
Filthy ruffian, you've dragged me down with you.
Dishonoured me.
You can die for all I care.
Then listen to my last words...
Has he gone?
Are you sleepy?
I was just falling asleep.
Where's the light switch?
At the foot of the bed.
Your elbow's hurting me.
Move your head closer, the pillow is cooler on this side.
Where's your hand?
That feels so good.
Let's just sit here and not move.
Are you cold?
No, I was falling.
I've been waiting so long for him.
What joy.
What joy in having killed our children.
My love... my love...
Just as these feathers fell, but a long way away, the survivors from the Château de Selliny emerged to return to Paris.
120 days earlier, four godless and unprincipled scoundrels had, driven by their depravity, shut themselves away to indulge in the most bestial of orgies.
To them, the life of a woman mattered no more than that of a fly.
They took with them eight lovely adolescent girls to serve as victims for their criminal desires plus four women well versed in debauchery, whose narrative skills would serve to stimulate their already jaded appetites whenever interest flagged.
Here are the survivors of these orgies, leaving the Château de Selliny.
First and foremost of the four instigators, the Duc de Blangis.
How do you do?
Mr. Carl Laemmle feels it would be a little unkind to present this picture without just a word of friendly warning.
We are about to unfold the story of Frankenstein, a man of science, who sought to create a man after his own image without reckoning upon God.
It is one of the strangest tales ever told.
It deals with the two great mysteries of creation, life and death.
I think it will thrill you.
It may shock you.
It might even horrify you.
So, if any of you feel that you do not care to subject your nerves to such a strain, now is your chance to...
Well, we've warned you.
Down! Down, you fool!
Now.
Come on.
Hurry, hurry.
The moon's rising. We've no time to lose.
Oh, careful!
Here he comes!
He's just resting, waiting for a new life to come.
Here we are.
Look. it's still here.
Climb up and cut the rope.
No!
Go on. it can't hurt you.
Here's the knife.
Look out!
Here's the knife.
Here I come.
Is it all right?
The neck's broken.
The brain is useless.
We must find another brain.
That will do, gentlemen.
And in conclusion, ladies and gentlemen, here we have one of the most perfect specimens of the human brain that has ever come to my attention at the university.
And here, the abnormal brain of the typical criminal.
Observe, ladies and gentlemen, the scarcity of convolutions on the frontal lobe, as compared to that of the normal brain, and the distinct degeneration of the middle frontal lobe.
All of these degenerate characteristics check amazingly with the case history of the dead man before us, whose life was one of brutality, of violence and murder.
Both of these jars will remain here for your further inspection.
Thank you, gentlemen. The class is dismissed.
Herr Victor Moritz.
Victor. I'm so glad you've come.
What is it, Elizabeth?
Oh, you've heard from Henry.
Yes. The first word in four months.
It just came.
Victor, you must help me.
Why, of course I'll help you.
I'm afraid.
I've read this over and over again, but they're just words that I can't understand.
Listen.
You must have faith in me, Elizabeth. Wait.
My work must come first, even before you.
At night, the winds howl in the mountains.
There is no one here.
Prying eyes can't peer into my secret."
What can he mean?
What does he say then?
I am living in an abandoned, old watchtower, "close to the town of Goldstadt.
Only my assistant is here to help me with my experiments."
Oh, his experiments.
Yes, that's what frightens me.
The very day we announced our engagement, he told me of his experiments.
He said he was on the verge of a discovery so terrific that he doubted his own sanity.
There was a strange look in his eyes, some mystery.
His words carried me right away.
Of course, I've never doubted him, but still I worry. I can't help it.
And now this letter.
All this uncertainty can't go on. I must know.
Victor, have you seen him? Yes.
About three weeks ago.
I met him walking alone in the woods. He spoke to me of his work, too.
I asked him if I might visit his laboratory.
He just glared at me and said he would let no one go there. His manner was very strange.
Oh, what can we do?
Oh, if he should be ill...
Now, don't worry. I'll go to Dr. Waldman, Henry's old professor in medical school.
Perhaps he can tell me more about all this.
Oh, Victor, you're a dear.
You know I'd go to the ends of the Earth for you.
I shouldn't like that. I'm far too fond of you.
I wish you were.
I'm sorry.
Good night, Victor, and thank you. Thank you.
Good night.
And don't worry. Promise?
I won't.
What is it?
I'm coming with you.
But, Elizabeth, you can't do that!
I must!
I'll be ready in a minute.
Herr Frankenstein is a most brilliant young man, yet so erratic, he troubles me.
I'm worried about Henry. Why has he left the university?
He was doing so well, and he seemed so happy with his work.
Well, you know, his researches in the field of chemical galvanism and electro-biology were far in advance of our theories here at the university.
In fact, they had reached a most advanced stage.
They were becoming dangerous.
Herr Frankenstein is greatly changed.
You mean, changed as a result of his work?
Yes, his work.
His insane ambition to create life.
How?
How?
Please tell us everything, whatever it is.
The bodies we use in our dissecting room for lecture purposes were not perfect enough for his experiments, he said.
He wished us to supply him with other bodies, and we were not to be too particular as to where and how we got them.
I told him that his demands were unreasonable, and so he left the university to work unhampered.
Oh. The bodies of animals.
Well, what are the lives of a few rabbits and dogs?
You do not quite get what I mean.
Herr Frankenstein was interested only in human life.
First to destroy it, then recreate it.
There you have his mad dream.
Can we go to him?
You will not be very welcome.
Oh, what does that matter? I must see him.
Dr. Waldman, you have influence with Henry. Won't you come with us?
I'm sorry, but Herr Frankenstein is no longer my pupil.
But he respects you. Won't you help us to take him away?
Very well, Fräulein. I've warned you.
But if you wish it, I will go.
Fritz!
Hello.
Have you finished making those connections?
Yes, they're done.
Well, come down then and help with these attachments.
We've lots to do.
Look out.
Fool!
If this storm develops as I hope, you will have plenty to be afraid of before the night's over.
Go on. Fix the electrodes.
This storm will be magnificent!
All the electrical secrets of heaven!
And this time we're ready, eh, Fritz?
Ready.
Why, what's the matter?
Look!
There's nothing to fear.
Look.
No blood, no decay.
Just a few stitches.
And look, here's the final touch.
The brain you stole, Fritz.
Yes. Think of it. The brain of a dead man, waiting to live again in a body I made with my own hands.
With my own hands.
Let's have one final test. Throw the switches.
Good.
In 15 minutes, the storm should be at its height.
Then we'll be ready.
What's that?
There's someone there.
Quiet.
Send them away. Nobody must come here.
Here! Cover this.
Whoever it is, don't let them in.
Leave them to me.
Of all times for anybody to come, now!
Think I'm going to let these people in? Not much.
I'll show them, messing about at this time of night. Got too much to do.
Wait a minute! All right! All right!
Wait a minute. I'm coming.
It's Dr. Waldman, Fritz.
You can't see him. Go away.
All right, knock, but you can't get in.
Henry!
Frankenstein!
Open the door!
Let us in!
Who is it? Who is it?
What do you want?
You must leave me alone now!
It's Elizabeth. Open the door!
What do you want?
Open the door.
Let us in!
You must leave me alone.
Henry, at least give us shelter!
What's all this nonsense of locked doors? Henry!
Elizabeth, please. Won't you go away? Won't you trust me, just for tonight?
Oh, you're ill. What's the matter?
Nothing.
I'm quite all right. Truly, I am.
Oh, can't you see I mustn't be disturbed?
You'll ruin everything. My experiment is almost completed.
Wait a moment.
I understand.
I believe in you, but I cannot leave you tonight.
You've got to leave!
Henry, you're inhuman!
You're crazy!
Crazy, am I?
We'll see whether I'm crazy or not.
Come on up.
Are you quite sure you want to come in?
Very well.
Forgive me, but I'm forced to take unusual precautions.
Sit down, please.
Sit down!
You too, Elizabeth. Please.
A moment ago, you said I was crazy.
Tomorrow we'll see about that.
Don't touch that!
I'm sorry, Doctor, but I insist.
Please.
Dr. Waldman, I learned a great deal from you at the university about the violet ray, the ultraviolet ray, which you said was the highest color in the spectrum.
You were wrong.
Here in this machinery, I have gone beyond that.
I have discovered the great ray that first brought life into the world.
Oh. And your proof?
Tonight you shall have your proof.
At first, I experimented only with dead animals and then a human heart, which I kept beating for three weeks.
But now, I'm going to turn that ray on that body and endow it with life.
And you really believe that you can bring life to the dead?
That body is not dead.
It has never lived.
I created it.
I made it with my own hands from the bodies I took from graves, from the gallows, anywhere!
Go and see for yourself.
You, too.
Dead, eh?
Quite a good scene, isn't it?
One man crazy, three very sane spectators.
Is everything ready?
Get the batteries.
Look. it's moving.
It's alive. it's alive.
It's alive. It's moving. It's alive.
It's alive!
Henry, in the name of God.
In the name of God!
Now I know what it feels like to be God!
Henry is well, but he's very busy. He said he would get in touch with you soon.
Don't worry about him, Baron. He'll be home in a few days.
You two have it all arranged, haven't you?
You think I'm an idiot, don't you?
But I'm not.
Anyone can see with half an eye that there's something wrong.
And I have two eyes, pretty good ones, at that. Well, what is it?
You're quite mistaken, Baron.
What's the matter with my son?
What's he doing?
He's completing his experiments, that's all.
Why does he go messing around an old, ruined windmill, when he has a decent house, a bath, good food and drink and a darned pretty girl to come back to?
Will you tell me that?
Oh, Baron, you don't understand.
I understand perfectly well.
There's another woman, and you're afraid to tell me.
Pretty sort of experiments these must be.
Oh, but you're wrong.
And how do you know?
If you please, Herr Baron, the Burgomaster.
Well, tell him to go away.
But he says it's important.
Nothing the Burgomaster can say can be of the slightest importance.
Good day, Herr Baron. Fräulein.
Well, what do you want?
If it's trouble, go away. I have trouble enough.
Oh, there's no trouble, sir.
What do you mean, "No trouble"?
There's nothing but trouble.
I brought you these flowers.
Thank you, Herr Vogel.
Both in my private and official capacities as Burgomaster...
Yes, yes, yes, yes, we know all about that, but what do you want?
Well, what I really want to know is, when will the wedding be, if you please?
Unless Henry comes to his senses, there'll be no wedding at all.
But, Herr Baron, the village is already prepared!
Well, tell them to unprepare.
Oh, but such a lovely bride.
Such a fine young man, the very image of his father.
Heaven forbid.
But, sir, everything is ready!
I know that. Don't keep on saying so, you idiot.
There's nothing to cry about.
Good day, Miss Elizabeth. Good day, Herr Moritz.
Good day, Herr Vogel.
Good day, Herr Baron.
And good riddance to you.
There you are. You see how it is.
The whole village is kept waiting.
The bride is kept waiting.
And I am kept waiting.
Henry must come home, if I have to fetch him myself. No, no, Baron.
What do you mean, "No, no"?
What about his work?
Stuff and nonsense! What about his wedding?
There is another woman, and I'm going to find her.
Oh, come and sit down, Doctor.
You must be patient.
Do you expect perfection at once?
This creature of yours should be kept under guard!
Mark my words, he will prove dangerous!
Dangerous?
Poor old Waldman.
Have you never wanted to do anything that was dangerous?
Where should we be if nobody tried to find out what lies beyond?
Have you never wanted to look beyond the clouds and the stars, or to know what causes the trees to bud, and what changes a darkness into light?
But if you talk like that, people call you crazy.
Well, if I could discover just one of these things, what eternity is, for example,
I wouldn't care if they did think I was crazy!
You're young, my friend.
Your success has intoxicated you.
Wake up and look facts in the face.
Here we have a fiend whose brain...
Whose brain must be given time to develop.
It's a perfectly good brain, Doctor.
Well, you ought to know. it came from your own laboratory.
The brain that was stolen from my laboratory was a criminal brain.
Oh, well. After all, it's only a piece of dead tissue.
Only evil can come of it.
Your health will be ruined if you persist in this madness.
I'm astonishingly sane, Doctor.
You have created a monster, and it will destroy you!
Patience, patience.
I believe in this monster, as you call it, and if you don't, well, you must leave me alone.
But think of Elizabeth, your father.
Elizabeth believes in me.
My father never believes in anyone.
I've got to experiment further.
He's only a few days old, remember.
So far he's been kept in complete darkness.
Wait till I bring him into the light.
Here he comes. Let's turn out the light.
Come in.
Sit down.
You see?
it understands.
Watch.
Take care, Herr Frankenstein!
Shut out the light!
Sit down.
Go and sit down.
It understands this time. It's wonderful.
Frankenstein! Frankenstein! Where is it?
Quiet, you fool!
Get away with that torch!
Quick!
Fetch the rope. Quick!
Get him to the cellar!
Shoot it! It's a monster!
Quiet.
Cooperate!
You'll have the whole countryside on us!
Come away! He has the strength of 10 men.
This is madness.
Give me that.
Oh, come away, Fritz.
Leave it alone.
Listen. What's that?
It's Fritz!
Come on, Doctor.
Quick. Hurry.
Get back.
Get back. Get back.
Quick. Quick!
He hated Fritz. Fritz always tormented him.
Come, come.
Pull yourself together.
What can we do?
Kill it, as you would any savage animal.
We must overpower him first. Get me a hypodermic needle.
It's murder.
It's our only chance.
In a few minutes he'll be through that door. Come quick. Hurry.
Got it? Yes.
Here it is.
It's very strong. Half-grain solution. Good.
Now, then.
You stand there. When he goes toward you, I will make the injection in his back.
Right.
Ready?
Yes.
Get back. Back!
Are you hurt?
No, no, I'm all right. It's nothing. See who's at the door.
What's happening here?
Elizabeth and your father are coming up the hill to see you.
You must keep them out.
Too late.
They must not see that. Here, quick, give me a hand. Quick.
Henry, you better hurry upstairs and get that blood off your face before your father and Elizabeth get here.
All right.
Well, pretty sort of place for my son to be in, I must say.
Is that the front door?
Yes, this is it.
Why,
I don't like it, but here goes.
There doesn't seem to be anybody in the place.
What a forsaken place here.
You're trying to burn it down, eh?
What's that for, eh?
What's the matter with you?
You look as though you've been kicked by a horse.
Where's Henry?
Well?
He can't be disturbed just now.
Oh, can't he?
I'll soon settle that nonsense.
Victor, where is he?
This place seems to drive everybody crazy. I...
Good heavens, what's that?
I beg your pardon. I am Dr. Waldman.
Oh, are you?
I'm Baron Frankenstein.
Perhaps you know what all this tommyrot's about.
I'll be shot if I do.
I would advise you to take Henry away from here at once.
What do you suppose I'm here for, pleasure?
Huh? Where are you, my dear? Oh, there you are.
Let's go and see what's up the awful stairs.
I don't know how the deuce I'm going to get up them.
Do the trick. Leave them alone.
No banisters or anything else. God bless his soul. How much further?
Come in.
Victor, Dr. Waldman, come quickly!
My dear, what have they done to you?
Poor, poor, Fritz. It's all my fault.
Get him on the sofa.
Come on.
Oh, my boy.
Thank you.
Have you got any brandy?
I did it.
Quick, quick, quick, quick.
Here, I'll do that.
Come on, boy. Now, now, now, drink. Drink this.
There. There, that's better.
I'm going to take you home with me, Henry.
No, I can't. My work. What will happen to the records of my experiment?
We will preserve them.
And...
I will see that it is painlessly destroyed. No. Yes, yes.
Leave it all to me. Poor Fritz. All my fault.
There, Henry. You can't do any more now. You must come home until you get well again.
You'll soon feel better when you get out of here.
It's like heaven, being with you again.
Heaven wasn't so far away all the time, you know.
I know, but I didn't realize it.
My work...
Those horrible days and nights. I couldn't think of anything else.
Henry. You're not to think of those things anymore. You promised.
All right. Let's think about us.
When will our wedding be?
Let's make it soon.
As soon as you like.
For three generations, these orange blossoms have been worn at our weddings.
Your great-grandfather wore this, Henry.
Looks as good as new now, eh?
Thank you. And here.
Here's one to make the best man look still better.
Thank you, sir.
Thirty years ago, I placed this on your mother's head, Henry.
Today you'll make me very happy by doing the same for Elizabeth.
And I hope in 30 years time, a youngster of yours will be carrying on the tradition.
And now, how about a little drink, eh?
My grandfather bought this wine and laid it down.
My grandmother wouldn't let him drink it.
Oh, bless her heart. Here's to your very good health.
Well, you all full?
Yes? Come along.
Here's a health to a son of the house of Frankenstein.
Here's a jolly good health to young Frankenstein.
Here, Hyde.
Give the servants some champagne.
This stuff's wasted on them.
Well, well, well, well.
Go on, mop it up, mop it up. it'll do you good.
To the house of Frankenstein.
To the house of Frankenstein.
Thank you.
Now, then, now be off about your business.
Listen.
Listen to them.
The boys and girls are busy, my dear.
It's extraordinary how friendly you can make a lot of people on a couple of bottles of beer.
Tomorrow they'll all be fighting.
They're calling for you, Baron.
Well, I suppose I'd better show myself.
Make a little talk.
Quiet!
Thank you all very much indeed. I am very pleased to see you all, and I hope there's plenty of beer.
At all events there's lots more where that came from.
You stay here, Maria. I'll just take a look at my traps.
Then we'll go to the village and have a grand time, huh?
You won't be long, Daddy?
Oh, no, no.
If Hans comes by, tell him I'll be back soon?
Daddy, won't you stay and play with me a little while?
I'm too busy, darling.
You stay and play with the kitty, huh?
Bye, Daddy.
Goodbye. Be a good girl now.
Come on, kitty.
Who are you?
I'm Maria.
Will you play with me?
Would you like one of my flowers?
You have those, and I'll have these.
I can make a boat.
See how mine floats?
No, you're hurting me! No!
Oh, how lovely you look.
But you shouldn't be here.
I must see you for a minute.
Well, what's the matter?
Could you leave us for a moment?
Why, of course.
Well, what is it?
Oh, I'm so glad you're safe.
Safe? Of course I'm safe. But you look worried.
Is anything wrong?
No, forget my foolishness.
It was just a mood. There's nothing the matter.
Of course there isn't.
Henry, I'm afraid, terribly afraid.
Where's Dr. Waldman? Why is he late for the wedding?
Oh, he's always late. He'll be here soon.
Something is going to happen.
I feel it. I can't get it out of my mind.
You're just nervous. All the excitement and preparation.
No, no, it isn't that. I felt it all day.
Something is coming bet ween us.
I know it. I know it!
Sit down and rest.
You look so tired.
If I could just do something to save us from it.
From what, dear? From what?
I don't know. if I could just get it out of my mind.
Oh, I'd die if I had to lose you now, Henry.
Lose me?
Why, I'll always be with you.
Will you, Henry?
Are you sure?
I love you so.
Sure. How beautiful you look.
What's that? What's that?
Henry! Henry!
Henry!
Dr. Waldman! Dr. Waldman!
What about Dr. Waldman?
Henry, don't leave me. Don't leave me.
No, darling, you stay here.
Dr. Waldman's been murdered in the tower.
The monster?
He's been seen in the hills terrorizing the mountainside.
He's in the house.
He's upstairs!
It's in the cellars.
It's Elizabeth.
Come on.
Someone open the door!
Where is it?
Don't let it come here. No, no, no, darling. Don't let it come here.
It's all right.
Don't let it come here. It's all right, darling.
It's all right.
Oh, look!
Look, Maria!
Silence! Silence!
Silence. What is it? What is it?
Maria, she's drowned.
My poor man, why do you bring her here to me?
But she has been murdered.
Silence!
I'll see that justice is done! Who is it?
How is Elizabeth now?
I don't know.
She's still in a daze. Just looks at me and says nothing.
It's maddening.
Easy, old man. She'll be all right.
Our wedding day.
Steady.
Your wedding will only be postponed a day at most.
A day?
I wonder.
What do you mean?
There can be no wedding while this horrible creation of mine is still alive.
I made him with these hands, and with these hands, I'll destroy him.
I must find him. I'll go with you.
No.
You stay here and look after Elizabeth.
I leave her in your care, whatever happens.
You understand?
In your care.
Quiet!
Ludwig, you will search the woods. Those are your group.
We'll get him.
Quiet!
Herr Frankenstein, you will take to the mountains.
Those are your people.
I will lead the third group by the lake.
Remember, remember, get him alive if you can, but get him!
Quiet!
Search every ravine, every crevice, but the fiend must be found!
Are you ready?
Yes!
Then light your torches and go!
Stop! Stop, men.
Frankenstein, mountains.
Ludwig...
Lake party, this way!
Come on, men!
Come on, boys. Keep together.
Now, you search there. The rest, come with me.
Go over there!
Go on.
Come on, men! Come on!
Herr Frankenstein! Herr Frankenstein!
Come on, men! Hurry up.
This way.
Which way?
Which way did he go? Hans, which way did he go?
Tell me.
Tell me!
Over there.
You stay here and take care of him. The rest, follow me. Come on.
Come on, quick!
Come on!
No, come back.
This way!
Herr Frankenstein!
Where are you?
I think he's up there. Come on, follow him. Follow him.
Follow him.
Quick!
Hello!
Fire. Fire!
Help! Help!
Listen!
Help!
It's Frankenstein.
That way!
This way. Come on.
Hurry. Hurry!
There! Turn the hounds loose!
Once more.
There he is!
The murderer!
Bring him down to the village, and let's take him home.
Burn the mill!
Burn the mill.
Have you got it?
Yeah. Come on.
Hurry up.
Quiet, quiet.
Well, go ahead and knock.
Well, well, well. What's all this?
What do you want, eh?
What's this?
If you please, Herr Baron, we thought that Mr. Henry could do with a glass of his great-grandmother's wine.
Fine old lady, my grandmother.
Very foreseeing of her to prevent my grandfather drinking this.
Mr. Henry doesn't need this.
Well, as I said before, I say again.
Here's to a son to the house of Frankenstein.
Indeed, sir.
We hope so, sir.
Fritz Lang's M was approved by the Berlin Film Censorship Office in a 117-minute version on April 27, 1931, and received its premiere on May 11, 1931.
The film was rereleased in a shortened 98-minute version in March of 1960 under the title M, Dein Morder sieht Dich an.
The original negative is preserved at the Federal Film Archive in a 96-minute version.
Whenever possible, missing scenes were filled in using prints from the same period from the Cinematheque Suisse and the Netherlands Film Museum.
In its present form, the film runs 110 minutes.
Sound Restoration: KirchMedia, Munich, and Martin Sawyer Sound Services, London
Just you wait, it won't be long
The man in black will soon be here
With his cleaver's blade so true
He'll make mincemeat out of you!
You're out.
I told you to stop singing that awful song!
Didn't you hear me?
That same cursed song over and over!
Dear me, that's heavy.
What's the matter?
I told those kids to stop singing that awful song, but they sing it all day long.
As if we haven't heard enough of that murderer already.
Leave them alone.
As long as we can hear them singing, at least we know they're still there.
Yes, I guess you're right.
PUBLIC SCHOOL
10,000 MARKS REWARD - WHO IS THE MURDERER?
Little Kurt Klawitzky and his sister Klara have been missing since June 11th.
Evidence leads us to believe the children were victims of a crime similar to that committed last fall against the Doering siblings.
What a pretty ball you have there.
What's your name?
Elsie Beckmann.
Didn't Elsie come with you?
No.
She didn't come with us.
Thank you.
A thrilling new chapter, Mrs Beckmann. Passionate and moving.
Just a moment, Mr Gehrke.
Tell me, Mr Gehrke.
Have you seen little Elsie?
No. Didn't she just come up the stairs?
No, she's not home yet.
She won't be long now. Goodbye.
Goodbye, Mr Gehrke.
Extra!
No, I can't give change!
Extra!
Makes you afraid to send your kids to school!
Who is the murderer?
Because the police did not publish my first letter,
I am writing now directly to the press!
Proceed with your investigations.
All will soon be confirmed.
But I'm not done yet!
10,000 MARKS REWARD
Christ, here we go again!
This is horrible!
The print's too small. We can't read it.
You in front, read it out loud!
Let him read!
Hey!
Quiet!
The terror in our town has found a new victim."
Louder!
We can't hear a word!
Certain evidence leads us to believe that this is the same murderer who has already claimed eight victims from among our city's children.
We must emphasise once again that it is, now more than ever, every mother and father's sacred duty to alert their children to this ever present danger and to the friendly guise it is likely to assume.
A little candy, a toy, or an apple can suffice to lure a child to his or her doom."
Very true!
Keep reading.
Anxiety among the general public is heightened by the police's failure to apprehend a suspect.
But the police are faced with the almost impossible task of catching a criminal who left not the slightest clue behind.
What does he look like?
Where is he hiding?
No one knows him, yet he is among us.
Anybody sitting next to you could be the murderer."
Yes, that's very true.
Why look at me when you say that?
You know very well.
What do I know very well?
Think about it. It'll come to you.
What are you saying?
I saw you follow that little girl from the fourth floor up the stairs.
You're crazy, you dirty swine!
Who's the swine?
Me, or a man who chases little girls?
You bastard!
You swine!
Murderer!
Gentlemen!
I'll see you in court!
I'll have you locked up!
Slanderer!
Trying to ruin my reputation!
Damn slanderer!
Besmirching a man's good name!
And the police fall for it!
A search warrant!
How awful!
What a disgrace!
Searching a man's house based on an anonymous letter!
Mr Jager, please calm down. We're only doing our job.
As if it weren't enough that we're in constant fear for our kids!
You see?
That's why the police must follow up every lead.
Any man on the street could be the murderer.
Can you please tell me what time it is?
Yes, my child.
Now you must hurry home. Where do you live?
What's it to you where the kid lives?
Excuse me?
What do you want with that kid?
Absolutely nothing!
What do you want with me?
I'll show you what I want!
Let me go!
This is an outrage!
What's going on?
This is an outrage!
What does Four-Eyes want?
Don't get so excited.
First chatting up children...
Punch him in the face!
...then acting like a big shot!
Will you let me go!
I didn't even speak to the child!
Get her alone, eh?
And kill her like the others, right?
He's the murderer!
Hold him!
Call the police!
Never around when you need 'em!
Officer!
Make way, gentlemen. Let us through.
Sure, you can catch pickpockets!
Why don't you catch the murderer instead!
What?
Is he the murderer?
Break it up! Come on, move along!
The murderer!
The monster!
Get him!
Tackle him!
MURDERER WRITES TO THE PRESS
Because the police did not publish my first letter,
I am writing now directly to the press!
Proceed with your investigations.
All will soon be confirmed.
But I'm not done yet!
This is a terrible scandal!
Lmagine the effect such a note will have on the public, Commissioner!
This is simply irresponsible!
Mr Secretary, we cannot stop the murderer from writing to whomever he wishes!
This severely pathological man probably takes great pleasure in seeing his crimes covered in the press.
We immediately got in touch with the newspaper and had them send us the original letter.
The lab's working on it right now.
Of course, you can't get good fingerprints from a postcard that's passed through so many hands.
Nevertheless, we will leave no stone unturned.
We'll painstakingly compare the results against our archives in hopes of finding something that can be used to solve this case.
Then we'll send the letter to our graphologist.
The aforementioned diamond-shaped and swelling sweeps, clearly seen in the word 'soon', third line from the bottom..."
You got that?
Yes.
...attest to the strongly pathological sexuality of this sex offender."
The partially disrupted and uneven style of his other letters is, in its interpretation, a form of acting which may manifest externally as indolence or even lethargy.
The writing as a whole displays elusive yet unmistakable signs of madness.
Yes, of course, Commissioner.
I have no doubt you're doing your job, and your men as well.
But we need results!
Results!
Mr Secretary, my men haven't gotten 12 hours' sleep in an entire week!
My riot squads don't get a moment's peace.
They report for duty almost more fatigued than when they were dismissed.
Because the painstaking nature of their work wears on the nerves, and 80%, if not 90%, of our leads are false.
The homicide squad doesn't even get time to change clothes.
They're constantly on call, always tense and alert.
Ever ready to spring into action, to follow even the slightest lead, as it just might be the one that solves the case.
Mr Secretary, just consider the search of the crime scene.
To give you an example, in the bushes just behind a picket fence, a small, white, crumpled paper wrapping was found.
It apparently once contained inexpensive sweets.
In the outermost corner were found traces of fruit drops and particles of powdered sugar.
We've tried to trace the origin of this wrapper in every candy shop and grocery store within a radius of a mile and a half, but all to no avail.
With each passing day we expand the area searched.
But, of course, after such a long time, no one remembers anything that could serve as a lead.
Despite all these setbacks, we're forced to press on in our investigation, always in uncertainty and with little chance of success in bringing the case even one step closer to its conclusion.
Our men are doing everything...
What good is all this?
Commissioner, I'm aware you're not dawdling, but that doesn't change the fact that an unknown killer is terrorising four and a half million people!
And the police are getting nowhere!
Mr Secretary, you don't seem to have a clear picture of the enormous obstacles confronting our forces.
Do you realise, for example, regarding the route the child took home, that there are fifteen conflicting eyewitness accounts alone?
Let me give you a random example:
Testimony 1,478 in the Beckmann murder case..."
You've got no clue.
More than you, mister!
Gentlemen!
You must at least know the colour of the cap the little girl wore whom you say you saw with the stranger!
Of course, Inspector.
It was red!
It was green!
Red!
Stop!
This is pointless!
Thank you, gentlemen.
You're welcome!
Next witness.
If you rely on a colour-blind man for clues, don't be surprised if you get nowhere!
In their hunt for this unknown killer, the police have tracked down more than 1,500 detailed leads.
The files in this case fill 60 thick volumes.
We've dispatched all our forces to systematically comb the area adjoining the city.
Every piece of undergrowth is scoured, every thicket searched.
Every bush examined, since any bush or hollow could harbour some object that could finally set us on the right track.
We called in police dogs.
We set the best trackers on the faintest of traces, but they lost the scent and failed to pick it up again despite all efforts.
Since the first murders, the police have searched homeless shelters night after night, subjecting everyone in them to thorough scrutiny.
This does not, of course, make the police very popular, nor does it reduce the general public's anxiety.
Railway stations are kept under surveillance around the clock.
Still, the investigation has not yet yielded the slightest results.
Nor have nightly raids in the criminal districts.
The cops!
Get back!
Back!
This is the police!
Let me go, you dirty bastard!
Let me go, you son of a bitch!
Goddamn bastard!
Put me down!
Let me go!
Let her go, you filthy pig!
Quiet!
Move back!
The top fuzz!
Quiet!
Police orders:
Nobody is to leave this establishment. Get your papers ready.
Please!
Come now, children, stop this foolishness.
Well, if it isn't Tubby Lohmann!
Quiet!
That'll get you nowhere.
Go after the murderer instead!
Right!
Quiet!
Be reasonable now!
Step back! You hear me?
Step back!
Let's go!
Come on, let's see those papers!
I haven't got any.
Let's see your papers.
Please let me go, Inspector!
The two guys who tried to escape were caught on the Krangasse.
Leave those chairs alone!
Shut up!
Have your papers ready!
Haven't we met before? - Yeah.
So?
Off to the precinct again!
Haven't even made a buck tonight!
Anyone without papers goes down to the precinct!
I tell you, I'm innocent, really!
Stop talking nonsense!
Let's get moving!
Kiss my arse!
Show your papers!
Where's the paddy wagon?
Don't push.
Everyone will get their turn.
Silence!
Cool it, kids!
Have your papers ready!
Your papers.
Inspector, I can't carry my birth certificate around with me everywhere!
Quit your bellyaching, child.
I really can't, Inspector!
The precinct for you!
You make me puke!
Shoddy work, my friend.
You've been had.
Precinct.
See you, Willy. Ta-ta!
Lay off!
Next.
Stuck-up snob.
What's wrong?
Papa Lohmann...
...nabbed him!
UNSOLVED BURGLARY AT FURRIER'S
We'd better take you down to the precinct too.
What do you mean?
My papers are in order.
Move on.
Move on!
Tough luck!
Next.
Papers.
Don't got none.
To the precinct.
Just my luck.
Next, come on.
You're ruining my business, Sarge. These raids every night.
No one can get a moment's peace!
They're human beings too.
You think we stay up all night just for the hell of it?
No.
But you're drivin' away my clientele, and you won't find the guy you're lookin' for here anyway.
If you knew how steamed they are at the guy who's causing these raids.
Especially the girls.
Sure, they solicit. Business is business.
But believe me, in every one of them beats a mother's heart!
I know a lot of toughs who get all teary-eyed just seein' the little ones at play.
If they ever get their hands on that monster, they'll make toothpicks out of him!
Ready to leave, Sergeant.
So long.
They hit the Crocodile Club today.
Two paddy wagons.
What's keeping Safecracker?
Is it 3:00 yet?
I'll find out.
The exact time, please, miss.
2:58.
Thank you.
2:58.
The cops are crawling the streets like ants again.
Green coats wherever you spit.
They're on your back even if you're with a broad.
They've gone nuts, got this murderer on the brain.
My old lady has a little six-year-old girl, and every night I have to check under the bed to see if the murderer's hiding there.
You can't do business anymore for tripping over cops everywhere.
There's no privacy anymore. I'm fed up with it.
What else is new?
Where the heck is Safecracker?
Think they might have nabbed him?
That guy?
Come on.
Scotland Yard laid a trap for him once on a bank job he pulled in London.
There he was, hands up, back to the wall cops all around him.
Seconds later there were three men dead on the ground, but he wasn't one of them!
No one better from Berlin to San Francisco.
They've been after him six years and they've yet to get him. Not yet.
But put enough dogs on the fox's tail...
Can it!
I can't take this!
He was always right on time before.
Thank God! - Finally.
Morning!
Are you nuts?
Close those blinds!
Gentlemen, I hereby open this meeting.
I declare all division leaders of this organisation present.
I assume you're authorised to make binding decisions for your divisions.
We'll dispense with the preliminaries, as we all know why we're here.
An outsider is ruining our business and our reputation.
Measures taken by the police and the daily raids to catch this child murderer are hampering our activities to an almost unbearable degree.
We can no longer tolerate the fact that we're not safe now in any hotel, bar, cafe or even private home from the clutches of the police.
Very true.
This state of affairs must end.
Things must return to normal or we'll go under.
Our coffers will soon be depleted.
If we can't get funds to support the wives of those members who currently enjoy room and board at state expense,
I don't know where we'll find the money to carry out our plans.
Our reputation is suffering as well.
The police seek the murderer in our fold.
Gentlemen, when I run head-on into an officer from the squad, he knows the potential risks, and so do I.
If either dies in the line of duty, fine. Occupational hazard.
But we must draw a firm line between ourselves and this man they're looking for!
We conduct our business in order to survive, but this monster has no right to survive!
He must be killed, eliminated, exterminated!
Without mercy or compassion!
Gentlemen, our members must be able to go about their business again without frantic cops in their way at every turn.
I invite your views, gentlemen.
Step up ID checks, comb the entire city, and raids, relentless, ever tougher raids!
We need informers!
We must know the police's plans almost before they do themselves!
The girls gotta work the cops more!
How often has one of us been nabbed because his girl ratted on him to the cops?
Now they can rat on the cops!
Every resident, every landlord, every property owner must be forced to consent to meticulous searches of his property for the slightest of clues.
What if we...
We have our connections.
What if we put an article in the papers that our syndicates, I mean, our organisation, doesn't wish to be lumped in together with this pig, and that the cops should look for this guy somewhere else.
He's not even a real crook!
This man may well be, when not engaged in the actual act of killing, a harmless, upstanding citizen who wouldn't hurt a fly.
In his right mind, perhaps he plays marbles with his landlady's kids or plays cards with friends.
Without what I'll call the innocuousness of these murderers' private lives, it's inconceivable that someone like Grossmann or Haarmann could have lived right next door to their neighbours for years without arousing the faintest trace of suspicion!
This is where we must focus the public's attention.
I'll tell you about public cooperation!
Just thinking of it makes me puke.
I beg your pardon, Commissioner.
But ain't it the truth?
What the devil has public cooperation gotten us so far?
Piles of letters full of the most outrageous slander!
Very true.
They alert homicide whenever a chimney sweep walks by.
That's right.
But when you really want reliable information from them, then they suddenly haven't got a clue.
Why, they just can't seem to remember a thing.
There's your public cooperation for you!
I believe you're exaggerating a bit, Lohmann.
It can't really be that bad, can it?
But it is, Commissioner!
Most of the public still takes the position,
How does this concern me?".
The idea that each individual is responsible for what happens to the poorest, most anonymous child on the street hasn't even dawned on the public at large!
I've got another idea.
There was this magician.
Te... Tele...
I can't remember what you call it.
Anyway, he could conjure up hidden pennies out of handkerchiefs.
The reward is still far too little money.
The man who leads us to the murderer should get a fortune.
None of this is anything new.
This is all leading nowhere.
So we just wait for the police to catch the guy instead?
The difficulties in solving crimes of this nature are, in my experience, often insurmountable, since perpetrator and victim are often brought together by mere chance.
The instincts of the moment drive the murderer's actions.
The victim is found and identified, his or her last known whereabouts are determined, and then... then comes the big question mark.
These children vanish without a trace.
And when they're found...
Well, we all know the state in which we've found them.
And the perpetrator...
It's a fact well-known to all of us that murderers like this rarely leave a clue behind.
That's what makes our work so hard, our successes so few.
The police have been after this murderer for eight months now.
They'll only get him by accident now.
We can't wait for that.
No, we'll go broke by then.
What, then?
We have to catch him ourselves.
Yes, that's what we must do.
There is perhaps one other way.
I'm quite certain that information on the individual in question must already exist somewhere.
Being the severely pathological case that he is, he has no doubt already had some kind of contact with the authorities.
That's why all health care facilities, prisons, clinics and insane asylums must be encouraged to cooperate with us unequivocally.
We specifically need information on those released after being deemed harmless to society but who, due to their inclinations, could be the murderer.
We must cover the city with a net of informers.
Every square mile must be under constant surveillance.
No child in this city must take a single step without us knowing it.
Fine, but how?
... - And who?
It must be people who can go anywhere without causing a stir, follow anyone without attracting attention, follow any child to any house without arousing suspicion.
In short, people whom the killer would never suspect.
But who?
There are no such people!
Who could do that?
The beggars.
The organisation of beggars!
MR CREDIT IS DEAD AND BURIED - THE MANAGEMENT
Blood pudding's on the upswing.
God, this cheese stinks so good.
Take that, you sons of bitches!
Hey, stop snoring. You'll wake up the lice.
Two, four, six...
NO BEGGARS OR PEDDLERS
SANDWICHES
Bread-and-butter sandwich, lukewarm response.
Black Friday for roast beef.
All right. Now come the courtyards.
Yes, from number 1 to 88.
Next.
You're responsible for the courtyards on Hauptstrasse from 1 to 88.
Got it.
What's next?
Hauptstrasse, from number 89... to 196.
Hauptstrasse, number 89 to 196.
Member number?
3795. Emil Dustermann.
Well, Emil, maybe you'll win the 15,000.
I've got my fingers crossed.
Knock on wood.
My heartfelt thanks, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you.
In searching homes, be on the lookout for any clue which could establish the origin of the murderer's letter to the Courier.
Be on the lookout as well for an old wooden table...
Idiot!
...or red pencil...
Come in.
...or writing paper of the type used by the killer. Inspector, here are reports on mental patients who've been released as cured or deemed harmless over the last five years.
Reports from every private and public institute, as well as from municipal hospitals and asylums.
And here's a list of their present addresses.
Good day.
Does a Mr Beckert live here?
Pardon me?
Does a Mr Beckert live here?
I'm afraid I don't understand. I'm a bit hard of hearing.
You don't say.
Does a Mr Beckert live here?
Mr Beckert, yes, he does.
But he just stepped out.
I had hoped to speak with him.
I'm from the tax office.
The tax office. Oh, my Lord!
Perhaps you'd like to wait for him...
Yes, thank you.
Please have a seat.
Thank you.
Perhaps you'd like something to read.
Thank you. Most kind.
THE GENERAL GAZETTE
Tell me, Mrs Winkler, does Mr Beckert subscribe to any newspapers?
Mr Beckert? No, he always borrows mine.
I see. Thank you.
Mummy!
I wanted to meet you halfway!
Child, you mustn't do that. You know why.
Good day. What would you like?
Coffee.
No, a vermouth.
No, a cognac.
Another.
The bill.
Two cognacs... That's 1.65, please.
Thank you very much.
Number 24: Beckert. Doesn't take the Courier
Table: Polished mahogany, with tablecloth.
No traces of red pencil. In fact, no writing materials of any kind.
Printed matter found in wastebasket:
Cigar ad and a postcard with flowers and 'Regards, Paul' on it, but no address of sender.
An empty cigarette pack, Ariston brand, a bag of candy..."
Just a moment.
Ariston?
What was that?
I'd like the file on the Marga Perl murder case.
Thank you very much.
That's odd.
I've heard that before.
It was...
Hey, Heinrich!
What is it?
What's wrong?
Listen.
Someone's whistling.
Can't you hear it?
There.
Now he's stopped.
Did you see the guy who was whistling?
Yes, I can still see him.
Heinrich, he's talking to a little girl and walking her down the street.
After him, quick, and don't lose him!
Why?
The day little Elsie Beckmann was killed, a man bought a balloon from me.
He was with a little girl and he whistled just like that!
Damn it, man!
Are you crazy, throwing orange peels on the ground?
A man could slip and break his neck! Unbelievable!
I should report you to the police!
Outrageous behaviour!
Hey, mister.
Here it is.
In a 150-foot radius of the crime scene, three cigarette butts of the Ariston brand were found." There you have it.
Yes, it may be the same brand of cigarettes, but there was no old wooden table.
Of course, he could have written that letter somewhere else.
Good God!
The window ledge!
You're right.
Just a minute.
Red pencil.
My God, finally!
We're finally on his trail.
What?
They're on his trail?
Did they find him?
The beggars found him.
His whistling gave him away. - They put a mark on him.
Shut up!
What did you say?
They're following the mark.
He isn't out of sight for a second.
His every move is being watched.
Mister.
What is it?
You got some white stuff on your coat.
Where?
On your shoulder.
Here, I'll wipe it off.
What's the matter? - Come on.
We're leaving.
He didn't come out this way. We would've seen him.
Out of the question!
Well, he didn't turn back.
He has to be somewhere, damn it!
Maybe he's hiding inside the building.
Closing time!
We can't let him get away in the crowd!
If he slips through now...
They're starting to come out!
Out in the street, and keep your eyes peeled!
Excuse me, may I ask you a question?
No, in my condition I can't eat anything like that...
The boss came to my office today...
Turn off the light.
He'll get suspicious if he comes home and sees it on.
What time is it, anyway?
Almost 6:30.
He's gotta still be inside!
He definitely didn't come out with the office crowd.
No, just a moment.
The beggars have called for backup and surrounded the whole building.
They figure the guy's hiding in the building.
What sort of building is it?
Nothing but offices.
I don't know what's in the basement.
There's a branch of the local savings bank on the ground floor, and the second to sixth floors are nothing but offices.
Above that is the attic space.
This is unbelievable.
Anyone still in there?
Anyone still in here?
Anybody still in here?
Damn carelessness!
All that trouble for one door.
Seems the guy's cornered now.
I think we should tip the cops off right away.
I agree.
Let's not waste time!
Stay by the phone and call back in a few minutes.
What is it?
Are you crazy or something?
The police? No!
We're gonna get this guy ourselves!
Listen, the time now is... 8:00.
All right. 9:00, 10:00...
At 11:00!
Evening. Did you know your gate isn't closed?
What?
That's impossible!
Why I just...
Wait, it is!
Open up, quick!
And not a sound!
Come on! Move it!
Let's go!
Come on, move it!
How many other watchmen are in the building?
Don't want to answer?
Very well.
There are still two watchmen on their rounds.
Goddamn it!
Damn piece of crap!
Goddamned lock!
Damn it to hell!
Shit!
Careful where you shine those lights!
And don't stomp around like elephants!
He's not in the basement.
We went through it all and found nothing.
Two men are still going through the boiler room.
Hold it!
This is the last one.
Go up and join Emil. He needs help.
Safecracker sent me.
All right.
Listen carefully.
This is a new type of time clock.
Here's a general diagram.
If they're not set at exactly the right minute, an alarm automatically goes off at the nearest police station.
You got it?
I'm not an idiot!
Well...
He's not in the boiler room or the coal room.
We turned over every piece of coal.
Hey!
Are you nuts?
What if the doors are wired?
You want the police here in five minutes?
We gotta get in if we're gonna search the whole place!
But not through the door, you idiot!
Go through the ceiling of the office above!
Nothing.
All right. Down we go.
Hey, what's up?
Hey! What is it?
Wait a minute!
Answer me, damn it!
What's going on?
I heard some banging!
Where are you off to?
Why are you running?
Wait, damn it!
I've gotta see Safecracker!
He's in the attic, I tell you!
I heard him knocking!
Quiet!
Go on!
He has to be in there!
Here's the light switch.
Force the locks.
Come on.
Hurry up!
Got him!
I found the guy!
He's in the attic!
I heard someone banging, and I told Safecracker.
He's up there with eight men. They'll get him any moment now.
Just came down to fill you in.
If I hadn't been alert, we could've looked for him for hours!
The watchman!
Three... one... four.
314.
Everybody out!
What? - The cops will be here in five minutes.
Damn it!
Who called them?
The watchman rang the alarm.
Let's scram!
Hold it!
Quiet down!
Five more minutes, six more storage sheds.
Move it!
Get going!
Not like that!
Out of the way!
He's not in here.
Come on!
He's not here either.
Move on! Next door!
Quickly!
We've only got three minutes left!
No padlock on this one... He must be here!
Open it!
Something's jammed inside.
Let me do it! Hurry! Only one minute left!
There he is, the dog!
Come on!
Move it!
Everybody out!
Get out while you can, damn it!
Move it!
For Christ's sake, get going!
What's keeping the others? - They're coming!
If not, they might as well stay here, with or without the guy!
What in the hell is keeping them?
Finally! Thank God!
Quick now!
Go! Make it snappy!
He's not down here.
Hey! Who pulled up the rope?
Hey, who pulled up the rope?
Bunch of morons!
Hello there.
Hands up!
How can I put my hands up when I'm holding on to the rope?
Come out of there!
I'm really innocent this time like a newborn babe.
This may surprise you, Franz but I believe you.
Then everything's in order, and I can go now, right?
Just a moment.
Cigarette?
I'll take your word for it, Franz, provided you can tell me
who the man was that you were looking for and that you found in that building.
I don't understand, Inspector.
A man, you say?
I know nothing about that. There must be some mistake.
I know nothing.
Nothing at all.
Of course.
There's just one thing I don't get:
Why you're covering up for the gang who left you in the lurch.
Fine friends, running off when things heat up, leaving you right in the fire.
Phooey!
That ploy won't work with me, Inspector.
What can happen to me anyway?
Maybe a little property damage, so what?
Nothing was pinched!
But something was pinched, my friend!
In fact, a good deal.
What?
Something got pinched?
How much?
Tell me what you know and I'll do the same.
I already told you. I know nothing.
Very well.
Give it some thought, Franz.
Leave a man alone for a couple hours and a lot comes back to him that he couldn't remember before.
Take him away.
Send the night watchman in.
Mr Damowatz.
Please sit down.
Now then, you said in your statement...
Listen carefully, in case you have to testify under oath later.
You clearly heard one of the burglars say to the guy guarding you,
We got him. I found the guy.
He's in the attic."
Ls that correct?
Yes, Inspector.
Yes, I'll swear to that anytime.
Good.
Go home now and recover from your ordeal.
But please remain available for further questioning.
Of course, Inspector.
Good morning, Inspector.
Morning.
Tell me, is Inspector Lohmann in the building?
He's talking to someone?
No, it doesn't matter.
I'll come over myself.
What?
I see.
Hasn't come home yet, eh?
Did you keep an eye on the old Winkler woman too?
Come in.
Come in!
Am I disturbing you?
Listen, the whole block is surrounded.
If he decides to go home, he has to run into us.
So just keep on waiting.
If anything happens, I'll be here at the precinct.
Damn it!
What do you want?
I wanted to ask a favour of you.
Dishwater again!
I wanted to ask you...
Read this first.
... - A statement?
Yeah.
An office building was broken into.
Bennostrasse?
That's a respectable part of town.
Perhaps not that respectable after all.
Hell, this is getting serious!
What the...
Did they mean to empty the brothel?
What could they have been looking for in the coal?
Incredible!
Unbelievable!
I'll be damned!
This is madness!
So they were after the savings bank!
Good God!
What could this mean?
I don't understand at all.
They didn't even touch it?
Must've been a bunch of real idiots!
I'll be damned!
Isn't that something?
Nothing stolen, but a man was carried off.
God knows where they took him.
That's just great.
And Franz isn't talking.
He's afraid, of course.
Guys like him would rather jump out the fifth-floor window than be mixed up in a murder rap. I know him well.
What if we could get at him from that angle?
Lohmann, if you'd be willing to help me out...
Very clever.
I see the wheels turning.
Let's send for this Franz.
You're wanted for questioning.
What?
They sent four guys for me?
What's this about?
Homicide squad.
Inspector Karl Lohmann."
What do you want with me?
What have I got to do with the homicide squad?
Yes, young man, your case has been turned over to me.
But why?
Why?
You boys did your work a little too well.
One of the watchmen...
Dead?
Accessory to murder.
Nasty business.
Inspector, I've had enough!
I want no part of this!
I'll tell you everything I know!
Very sensible, but, unfortunately, too late.
It can't be too late!
It can't be!
I'll tell you everything!
Even what we were looking for in that damn building.
Well...
The child murderer!
What?
Who?
The child murderer, Inspector.
Just a moment.
This had to happen to me!
Me, of all people.
Come sit down, my boy.
We're gonna level with each other, got it?
Certainly, Inspector.
And God help you if you pull something.
Now then, what have you boys got to do with the murderer and where was the guy taken?
Well, Inspector you know the old Kuntz  Ley distillery?
The one that went belly-up in the Depression?
That's the one.
Since then, the building's stood empty, and no one gives a damn about it.
Get out here! Move it!
Let me go!
What have I done to you? You swine!
Let go of me!
Bastards!
Swine! What do you want from me?
What do you want...
Help!
Help!
Let me out of here!
I want out!
Let me out of here!
You'll never get out of here.
Gentlemen, I beg of you!
I don't even know what you want with me.
I beg you, let me go.
This whole thing must be a mistake!
A mis...
No.
No mistake. Out of the question.
This is no mistake.
No.
No mistake.
You recognise this?
You bought a balloon just like this for little Elsie Beckmann.
Just like this one.
No!
Where did you bury little Marga Perl, you bastard?
But I never...
I never even met her!
You never even met her!
I suppose you never met her either?
Or her?
You never met her either?
Stop him!
Grab him!
Stop him!
Don't let him escape!
Watch out!
Punch him in the face!
Let go of me!
You have no right to treat me this way!
We'll show you we do!
You have no right to hold me here!
Right?
There's only one thing right for a man like you... death!
Right!
Kill him!
Kill the rabid dog!
Lce him!
Let him have it!
Quiet!
Kill him!
You spoke of right just now.
We will be your right.
Everyone sitting here is an expert in the rule of law!
From six weeks in Tegel prison to 15 years in Brandenburg.
They'll make sure you get your rights.
You'll even have defence counsel.
Everything according to the letter of the law.
Defence counsel?
I need no defence counsel!
Who's gonna prosecute me?
You, perhaps?
Hey, you.
If I were you, I wouldn't make big speeches.
Your head's at stake here, in case you hadn't noticed.
And just who are you?
I have the dubious pleasure of serving as your defence.
Though I'm afraid it won't do you much good.
Do you all want to kill me?
You want to just wipe me out?
We simply want to put you out of commission.
And we'll only be sure of that when you're dead.
But you can't murder me just like that!
I demand to be handed over to the police!
I demand to be brought before a real court of law!
That's a good one!
You'd like that, wouldn't you?
Look who's talking!
So you can plead insanity and spend the rest of your life being cared for by the state.
And then you break out of the asylum or receive a pardon, and you're happy as can be, free to kill with impunity, protected by law on grounds of insanity and you're back to chasing little children!
No, no more of that!
You must be taken out of action!
You must go!
But I can't help it!
I can't...
I really can't... help it!
We know that one!
Before the judge, we all "can't help it".
What would you know?
What are you talking about?
Who are you anyway?
Who are you?
All of you. Criminals.
Probably proud of it, too.
Proud you can crack a safe or sneak into houses or cheat at cards.
All of which it seems to me you could just as easily give up if you had learned something useful, or if you had jobs or if you weren't such lazy pigs.
But me?
Can I do anything about it?
Don't I have this cursed thing inside me?
This fire, this voice, this agony?
So you mean to say you have to kill?
I have to roam the streets endlessly, always sensing that someone's following me.
It's me!
I'm shadowing myself!
Silently... but I still hear it!
Yes, sometimes I feel like I'm tracking myself down.
I want to run, run away from myself!
But I can't!
I can't escape from myself!
I must take the path that it's driving me down and run and run down endless streets!
I want off!
And with me run the ghosts of the mothers and children.
They never go away.
Always!
Except when I'm doing it.
When I...
Then I don't remember a thing.
Then I'm standing before a poster, reading what I've done.
I did that?
I don't remember a thing!
But who will believe me?
Who knows what it's like inside me?
How it screams and cries out inside me when I have to do it!
Don't want to!
Must!
And then a voice cries out, and I can't listen anymore!
Help!
I can't!
I can't!
The accused has stated that he can't help himself.
In other words, he must commit murder.
With that he has pronounced his own death sentence.
Right!
A man who claims that he's compelled to destroy the lives of others, such a man must be extinguished like a bonfire!
Such a man must be obliterated!
Wiped out!
May I address the court?
Counsel for the defence has the floor.
My learned colleague who just spoke, who is, if I'm not mistaken, wanted by the police on three counts of manslaughter...
That's irrelevant here.
...has claimed that the fact that my client was acting compulsively warrants the death sentence.
That's right!
He is mistaken, because the very nature of compulsion warrants an acquittal!
Get outta here, will you?
Are you nuts, or plastered?
It is precisely the nature of compulsion that relieves him of responsibility for his actions!
And a man cannot be punished for that for which he is not responsible!
Ridiculous!
You mean this monster should go free?
That he should live?
I'm saying that this man is sick, and you turn a sick man over to a doctor, not an executioner.
Will you guarantee his cure?
What does the state build asylums for?
What if he breaks out?
Or he's declared cured and released?
And one fine day the killing starts all over?
Another month-long manhunt!
Once again the insanity clause, once again the asylum!
Another breakout or possible release!
And again "must kill"!
Is this supposed to go on indefinitely?
No one has the right to kill a man who cannot be held responsible for his crimes!
Not even the state, and all of you least of all!
The state must ensure that this man is rendered harmless so that he ceases to be a danger to society!
You never had kids, did you?
Then you never lost any either.
But if you wanna know what it's like when a little child is taken from you, just ask the parents whose kids he took away!
Ask them about the days and nights not knowing what had happened, and later, when they finally found out...
Why don't you ask the mothers?
You should ask the mothers!
Think you'd get mercy from any of them for murdering their kids?
The woman's right!
Absolutely!
No mercy for the killer!
Let him have it!
Slaughter the bastard!
Kill the monster!
Kill him!
Put the animal to death!
Rub him out!
Kill him!
Waste him!
Get rid of him! ...
Annihilate the monster!
I will not let you shout me down!
I will not allow a murder to be committed in my presence.
I demand that this human being...
That's not a human being!
...that this human being be afforded the same protection under the law rendered the common criminal!
Not a chance!
I demand that he be handed over to the police!
The police!
Of all the dumb...
In the name of the law...
In the name of the people...
This will not bring our children back.
One has to keep closer watch over the children!
All of you!
Hello, Emily.
Hello, Fred.
I think you'll lik e me in this dress when it's done.
Oh. Have you broken your umbrella?
I made you steak and kidney pudding for tonight.
And i was wondering whether you'd like to stay in and listen to the wireless or go out to the pictures.
Mr. Baker will give his 12th talk on accountancy in 3 minutes.
The pictures then, dear?
Damn the pictures and the wireless and the office.
I want some life! Life, i tell you!
Like that.
What you want, dear, is some little liver pills and some fruit torte.
I don't want any pills.
I want some of the good things of life.
Money.
Why should you be able to spend less on yourself than some women do on their rotten poodles?
Why shouldn't you have a hairdresser and a lady's maid?
Why, Fred, i never expect those things.
That's just it.
The good little women like you don't want enough.
Get out of there!
I think the best place for us is a gas oven.
Fred!
To talk about gas ovens when we've a roof over our heads.
Food, beds...
oh, and lots of things.
Is that the post?
Oh, let it be the gas bill.
Serves you jolly well right if it is, talking about gas ovens.
Oh, thanks.
Have you left everything ready for me outside, mrs.
Porter? Yes, ma'am.
Thank you. Good night.
Good night, ma'am.
Good night, sir. Good night, mrs.
Is it the income tax?
Em! Quick, look.
See this, em?
Now you can have some real clothes.
Oh! My new dress!
Hurry up, old james, you'll be late for the office.
You know, em, i always got into the sea.
I hear it's a bit rough in the channel.
Hello. We're off.
Come on, em. Let's take a snap.
I say, em, i think i'll pop down and get you some sick... i mean, magazines.
Yeah, but... oh, my god.
D. They're not dresse i mean...
Let's get out of here. I don't like it.
Why not?
Somebody just pinched me.
Where?
You know where.
You leave it to me.
So long, folks.
See you tomorrow.
What's in that parcel, Fred?
For you.
I couldn't wear this.
People will think we aren't married.
don't feel a bit as if we are.
One of the sailors told me it was a bit rough outside.
Yes, i heard that, too.
I say, em... i think i'll go do wn to the cabin and, um, i mean, you know... to see if everything's all right.
All right, Fred.
Oh, excuse me.
Oh, hello, commander.
How do you do, miss emory?
Are we going to have a lot of fun and mischief?
I hope so.
We're not off yet.
Just about that much.
It's a marvelous night, isn't it?
Yes, isn't it?
Is your husband feeling better?
Oh, yes, he's much better.
He's really a very good sailor, but he's not used to it.
Yes.
Oh, commander gordon, aren't you coming down?
We're all waiting for you.
Do you mind if i have one more pipe in peace?
You know, these bright young people make one feel awfully old at times.
Oh, i like to keep them enjoying themselves.
Come in.
How do we go now, sir?
Would you like to try a little something?
Tell my wife.
She'll get me a grave.
Very good, sir.
Here's another.
May i draw on this?
Sorry? Yes.
You're the crazies t person, really.
Why do you say that?
I don't know. You're delicious.
I could sit and listen to you all the afternoon.
You're laughing at me.
No, no, i'm not, really.
Funny you should say that because i always find it so difficult to talk to people.
Do you?
Yes.
I find it quite easy... much easier than i could to my husband.
Do you know...
i see... i beg your pardon.
Oh, no.
Oh, please, i didn't mean to interrupt.
Go on.
Well, what i was saying was you know, i couldn't understand it at first.
But now i think i know why it is.
Oh? Why?
Well, you see, you're just a man and not my husband.
And if you get bored with me, all you've got to do is to get up and go away and it doesn't matter.
Yes, but it would matter very much.
Have you ever been in love, mr. Gordon?
No, i can't say that i have.
That's a pity.
That's a pity because it's difficult for you to understand.
You see, i love Fred and he loves me.
And naturally, i want him to think well of me.
When i talk to him, i'm always so frightened of saying something foolish.
You see, he's terribly clever.
And i'm not, eh?
No.
Oh, i think you're interesting and amusing.
And you like the things that i like... yes.
Well, that doesn't take much doing, does it?
No, i suppose not.
No, i don't think you're clever.
No, i supposed i'm not really.
I say, it's a very lucky thing that, uh, we're no t in love, isn't it?
Yes. Isn't it?
Love is a very difficult business, mr. Gordon.
You'd be surprised.
It makes everything difficult and dangerous.
You know, i don't think love makes people brave like it says in books.
I think it makes them timid.
I think it makes them frightened when they're happy and sadder when they're sad.
You see, everything's multiplied by two... sickness, death, the future.
It all means so much more.
Oh, i'm afraid i haven't made myself very clear.
Yes, you have.
You see, love's a wonderful thing, mr. Gordon.
Yes.
The kind of love that you're describing must be.
You know, i think i shall have to try it. You must.
You're just cut out for it.
But do be sure you get the right girl.
It'd be a crime if you were wasted.
Mrs. Hill... will you give me an honest answer to a straight question?
Why, yes.
Are you trying to pull my leg?
Pull your leg?
I don't quite know why i said that.
H. It's rather foolis forgive me, will you?
Oh, yes, of course.
What i was searching to say.
I mean... hello, gordon.
Why, hello, colonel.
Oh, and, um, this i presume is mrs. Gordon. Oh, there you are.
Now, come along, ken.
You distinctly promised me you wouldn't run away.
I want you to help me feed the seagulls. If you come along with me, colonel.
There you are.
No, no, commander, don't be silly.
If i may intrude for just a teeny weenie second.
It's just struck me, i have the very thing for your poor ill husband.
That's very kind of you.
I have a perfectly marvelous plaster.
You just put one on and the effects?
Magical.
But what do you?
There's one on the... next the skin.
I guarantee he'll be up tomorrow, i really do.
I guarantee it.
Thank you so much.
Oh, it's nothing.
I really only carry them for the benefit of the less fortunate.
Don't you think the world would be a better place, commander, if we all did that sort of thing a little more often?
Yes, i suppose so.
I'm afraid i don't bother very much about other people.
I don't believe it shall i fetch the plasters later on?
What?
Oh, yes, yes.
Now, commander, what about a 4 at bridge?
I'm afraid not.
I promised to take mrs. Hill for a stroll.
If you'll excuse me.
What a perfect gentle knight you are, commander.
Good evening.
Like to see a ship we were once passengers in?
Oh, gordon.
I called you gordon. Why, that's a christian name, too.
Yes.
I liked it.
It sounded kind of friendly.
The mister got lost out here, didn't it?
Yes, i'm glad. Let it stay lost.
It's rather good, eh?
Gordon.
Just one bloke to another.
I feel quite dizzy.
Let's go back.
Ah!
Well, upon my soul, i've been looking for you everywhere, when you were here all the time.
Behold, the wonder worker.
Thank you.
And tomorrow your husband will be up and looking after you again.
But poor commander gordon will be left right into the background.
There, there. I'm only joking.
You like my high spirits?
How funny.
Well, i must be going.
Good evening.
Well, i suppose i'd better be saying good night, too.
Is it all right?
Yes. From the office.
What's for dinner, em?
Steak and kidney pudding?
What, again?
Every other night it's steak and kidney pudding.
Gosh, em, i'm feeling fine.
I say, em, these deck games look good to me. Yes.
Drat! Ooh!
Oh, i'm most terribly sorry.
I say, damn it. You need to be more careful.
You might have knocked my eye out.
They ought to have a rope round here or something.
I say, old man, no need to go on like that.
It was quite an accident.
The princess couldn't help it.
Don't be angry with him.
I am not offended.
Get down. You'll fall.
Ah, Fred.
How lovely.
Ah, my bag... you'll stay here?
Yes.
Don't run away without me.
No.
Have you seen the colonel?
No? You hare. He's the re all the time.
Now, colonel, don't forget you're coming with me to buy my carpet.
What?
Oh, yes. Yes, you'd better come now, i think.
Good morning.
Don't forget you'' 're coming to buy my carpet, will you?
Fred, isn't it lovely?
Em, i shouldn't take that with you.
It makes you look like a tourist.
To think that place has been there all these years.
All those strange people having their babies.
Dying.
Cooking their funny meals.
Strange.
It's been there all these years.
You don't think they built it especially for us overnight, do you?
Well, you needn't snap my head off.
That's the third time you've spoken to me like that since yesterday.
Ah, Emily!
Oh, your husband. He looks so good.
Don't he?
Going ashore... oh, come.
Let us go.
Hello.
Aren't you going ashore? Yes.
Well, there's not too much time.
May i carry that for you?
Come on!
Em, are you coming bathing with the princess and me?
No, i'm staying with miss emory to buy her carpet.
Oh, my dear, really, that's quite all right.
I don't mind.
Fred... oh.
There.
There, there.
Yes, i like this, i think.
Come on. Uh... really.
Be careful, dear.
I rather like that.
Thank you.
Now, mr.
Gordon, you'll carry this for me, i'm sure... well, he's gone.
Well, colonel, you can carry it.
Good. Good morning.
Shall we go?
Fred may be looking for me.
Yes, i suppose we'd better.
Our little twin beds, huh?
Oh! My poor heart.
You make him jump so.
You feel?
Cabin number 19.
No, no, no.
Not right away.
You must be what you call indiscreet.
You go have your promised dance with the, um, gossip woman.
Then she will not look for you.
Cabin number 19.
Good evening.
Don't you think my shepherdess costume makes me look young?
Yes.
How old?
19.
Whoo!
Good evening.
Can i get you an ice?
Oh, yes, please do.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Aah!
I'm drunk, Emily.
No, you're not.
Admit it.
Well, if you are, i am, too.
Exactly.
Hello, em.
Hi, gordon.
Hello. Sit down. I'm tight.
What are you gonna have?
All right. I'll get you something.
Steward.
Oh, hello, Fred.
Hello.
Hello, Emily.
Oh, no, no, no. I sit there.
Why, hello, princess. What will you have?
Oh, i think, um, a brandy and soda.
Brandy and soda?
Oh, steward, a brandy and soda as well, please.
Have you a cigarette, Fred?
Yes, i think so.
Ah, what do you want, a cigarette?
I have one.
There you are.
Thank you.
It's a gorgeou s night outside.
Perfect for lovers.
Oh, have you seen my husband anywhere about?
I think he went ashore with the princess, madam.
? My wife?
? Won't let me...?
Well, uh... why not let me show you around town, eh?
I'd be delighted.
I say...
yes, sir?
When's there a boat leaving again for shore?
There's one going in 5 minutes.
5 minutes. Shall we?
All right.
You've been thinking a lot.
Oh, i'm as much at sea as ever.
It's a bewildering business, this, this being at sea.
But on the night of the carnival, i knew that Fred and the princess were... were drunk, too.
Compared with them, we were a pair of sober sods.
But i can't feel sorry.
About them?
About us.
Tell me, Fred, have you not a regret for treating Emily so?
Well, i wouldn't be human if i had no regrets.
Naturally, i feel for her.
I'd be a pretty poor sort of fish if i didn't.
Of course, she's fond of me i know.
I suppose we were happy enough in our own quiet little way until we came on this trip and i met you.
After that, of course, it was all out.
I mean, how can i be expected to love Emily when i...
when i love you?
Water is a good drink, but champagne he is better, yes?
That's it.
And having developed a taste for champagne what's the use of trying to stick to water?
Oh, well, maybe she will find someone who is nearer her own level.
Of course, you know, she never really understood me.
I was a bit too much for her.
Like to see a ship we were once passengers in?
It's running away from us now.
Him.
Is he going to beat us?
You are going to let me take care of you, aren't you oh, i don't know.
Let me make this figure real.
After all, you know, you drew it.
isn't it marvelous to think that after tonight we should always be together?
Yes.
But don't forget, Fred.
Tomorrow when we go ashore, i'm asked to get off alone.
Oh, yes.
My hand.
Sorry.
But i can't help feeling a bit worried about em.
I hope she'll be all right.
Fred... hmm?
If the woman can't hold her man, there's no reason why he should take the blame.
I suppose you're right.
You always are.
Shall we go inside?
All right.
Hip hip hooray! Hip hip hooray! Hooray!
Hip hip... hooray.
I've seen it all along.
Look at the way you made yourself an absolute slave to him.
Anyway, i'll be able to make you happy now.
You wouldn't go back to that dull life again?
Fred may have to go back.
Oh, he's fickle.
If he were a man, i'd feel ashamed.
As it is, i frown for him. Bluff.
Empty shirt.
Oh, gordon.
It used to make my heart ache to hear you worship that overgrown sham, the way you kowtowed to him.
He was just a great baby masquerading as a big, strong man.
I've held my tongue because i hadn't the heart to open your dear eyes.
But now, you're not his wife anymore.
Yet a princess fell in love with him.
Princess.
Do you know why Fred succeeded so admirably with her royal highness?
Because she's not a princess.
She's just a common adventuress and he was the biggest asset aboard.
She set her trap and caught him.
Why didn't you warn him?
Much good that would'v e done, sweetheart.
You can't teach the Freds of this world.
What'll happen to him?
I don't know, and i don't care.
When she's spent all his money, she'll drop him like a hot brick.
Then he can come to his senses.
Alone.
It's not our business, sweetheart.
M. We've got to forget hi but don't you see, i can't, gordon.
A wife's more than half a mother.
And i've been married to him for over 8 years.
It's a long time, you know that?
Oh, think what it means, gordon.
I hate to.
No, gordon. I can't!
Ask him to stop.
Fred... i've been down to make certain.
She has gone with him.
That must be the dinner i sent for.
Come in.
Oh, uh, wait there.
Put the bill on the table there.
Perhaps you would wish to speak alone with Fred? Eh?
I will wait downstairs for you, Fred. Yes?
Uh... i'll go and get a shirt.
Thank you, uh... princess.
You did not go with him.
You little fool. You damn little fool.
I'm just... i was just fixing up to go bathing with the princess.
You don't want to come, do you?
I suppose you'll be going somewhere with gordon.
He's gone.
He's what?
He's gone to his home.
Up country.
Well, fancy that.
He wanted to take me with him.
What's that?
He loves me.
And how far has this thing gone? Oh!
Fred, don't start play acting over this.
It'll only make things worse.
Oh, play acting. Huh!
Sorry state of affairs.
Yes, yes, Fred! Let's take all that as said!
I'd have gone with him if it hadn't been for you.
For me?
He'd have made me happier.
But you've no right... when i said i would, he started to show me you as the outside world sees you.
Not as i've seen you, blinded by love and all this long time together.
Don't... you're mad.
Yes, i was to have missed my chance.
But after what he said...
Oh, come in! Get out of here!
Well, what did he say then?
Just the truth, Fred.
He said you were a sham, nothing but a bluff.
I'll smash him to bits, is what i'll do.
He wouldn't have any fear of you, dear.
He knows you're just a great big coward.
Well, if you thought so much of him to listen to all his dirty lies about me, why the devil didn't you go with him?
Because i recognized your faults.
Whereas, before i'd always dressed you up in all kinds of silly virtues.
Oh, very much obliged, i'm sure.
I saw that i was the wife for you.
That without me, you'd be lost.
I couldn't allow that.
It wouldn't be right, would it?
Not right, eh?
Very kind of you, i'm sure.
And do you think that after the way you've behaved... i suggest that if you want to get this thing straightened out and not wreck everything through... this trip, you've got to do something about this.
Well, what's that?
She's a sham, too.
You don't tell me.
Is anybody or anything real then?
And in what way is the princess a sham, if it's not troubling you too much?
Because she's not a princess at all.
Because she's just a common, cheap adventuress.
And she only threw her hat at you because you were the one man on board... oh, shut up!
Shut up, damn you! It's true!
Shut up, i tell you.
Shut up!
I'll shut up when i've said... shut up!
That's all.
I'll go to the princess.
My things can be sent on.
Good-bye.
Just a minute.
Come in.
Thank you.
knowing you, i accept your verdict.
You have made your choice and i see the way of it.
I don't know much about love,
how long it lasts or what the remedies are,
but i love you, Emily.
So much that i can't write anymore... only blessings and prayers for you. "
Don't you dare say, "i told you so. "
She... caught the train to rangoon.
But i can't make i t out why she would... um, do you think that this has got her... give it to me.
What do you mean by hiding my letters?
She's gone.
She was a fraud.
She thanks me for my company and says her father kept a cleaning shop in berlin.
That little swine.
Yes! That's what she is.
The swine!
To treat you like that.
Oh, i could... what a fool she's made of me.
What a fool!
Oh, Fred.
Poor Fred. Oh, for god's sake, keep your pity!
But i tell you again,
If you say "i told you so," i'll strangle you i will, i swear i will.
Wish i could strangle her.
I'll set the police on her, that's what i'll do.
She hasn't done anything.
I mean, not broken any law.
Hasn't she just?
That's all you know. She's only robbed us of ³³1,000.
What?
You would like...? Get out!
But how could she?
Oh, she told me a pack of lies about an expected remittance or something.
Anyway, it was only to be a loan.
Well, not a loan exactly because we were pooling everything we had.
And then there were our passages to australia... of course, i was going to see the jeweler all right.
I mean... well, you were gonna run away with your precious gordon.
But i didn't.
Well, did i?
I wish i'd never come on the trip.
Think of that tart heading for burma with 1,000 of the best in her pocket and shoving her fingers to her nose.
How in god's name are we going to get home, Fred?
Shall we have enough?
Oh, i dare say we have enough to pay this bill and a cheap boat home.
Fred!
That's all right, darling.
All hands on deck!
What's up, em?
Em, what's happened?
We've stopped.
I don't know...
you must know.
I don't. What is it?
I don't know. I don't.
There was a big bang and something fell.
It hit you on the head.
You'll be fine.
Can't get the damn thing open.
The bolt!
Why can't you open this door, you fool?
Help! Help! Help!
Oh, help! Help! Help!
There go the lights, em.
Help! Help! Help!
Help!
It's no use, Fred.
We can't get out, em.
We're dying.
Oh, em, for god's sake.
Fred... do you mind very much?
Not now.
I did at first.
I'm... i'm scared, em.
Em... i'm sorry.
What for, Fred?
There's only been you.
There's only ever been you.
Oh, i know. I know.
Fred.
Fred! It's daylight.
Look.
Look at the port hole.
Don't do that. You'll let the sea in.
Be quicker anyway.
Fred, we could have got out last night.
The gangway is just outside.
If only we'd thought.
Oh, i'll go first to see if it's all right.
Come on, darling.
Come on. Don't forget, feet first.
Ahoy!
Have they gone, Fred?
Don't go sneaking up to a chap like that.
It's scary enough without playing funny tricks.
Of course they've gone
They'll come back, chappy. Oh, will they?
They'll reckon it's gone down hours ago instead of floating on like this.
Why did it, Fred?
How the dickens do i know?
The silly things you ask.
What the hell do we do now?
That's the question. Well, we want a boat or a raft or something.
You don't tell me.
Fred, hadn't we better go and find some clothes or something?
Somebody might come.
Yes, that's very likely.
Let's see what's in here.
I'd better give yo u a hand with these.
All right?
Yes.
That's better.
Ohh... he set next to me at dinner.
Let's go.
Phew. It's getting on my nerves.
I need a drink.
I know. Let's go down to the bar.
We'll have brandy. It'll warm us up.
Here we are. I tell you one thing:
We'd better get a move on and find some way out of this, make a raft or something.
Fred. Mm-hmm.
Here. Listen.
What?
Do you think it's mad if i use the gentleman's?
Ours is underwater.
Yes. Go on.
No sense in being suburban.
Listen.
Fred, look!
A chinese junk.
Give me your hand.
That's right.
There we are.
Uh, good afternoon.
Fred, look!
She's going to have a baby.
Seems all right, em.
Best meal i've eaten for ages.
Much better than all those swell meals we had in paris. Mm!
I like being shipwrecked.
It's not half as bad as people make out. Hmm.
Nothing ever is.
Why, this is as good as yachting.
Hi!
Dullard dummies, aren't they?
Ah...
What's the old boy up to?
Help me up, Fred.
Ok. Ooh!
Sat on a knot.
I'll tell you one thing, em.
What's that?
That ship going down has done us a bit of good in a way, you know.
Well, don't you see?
That ³³1,000 pounds i gave... i lost well, we can say it went down with the ship.
Why, yes.
And then we'll be able to get some more and buy some clothes and things when we land.
Yes. When we land.
Fred, do you hear that?
It's a baby.
What do you mean?
That woman's had her baby.
How could she?
Well, anyway, she has.
Isn't it wonderful
i'd better go and see if i can help.
Better keep out of it, em.
They don't want us. We'd only be in the way.
I suppose so.
There, there. Don't cry, em, old dear.
Why, these damn chinese breed like rabbits.
We're all right, em. We've got each other.
Oh, the poor little mite.
Gosh, isn't it ugly?
You mustn't do that! You mustn't!
No newly born baby could stand it!
Stop it, stop!
Don't be silly, em.
How would you like a chinaman to tell you how to manage your baby?
Besides, look how strong it is.
I bet that chap holding it is the father.
See how proud he is of it?
I made a nice steak and kidney pudding and i've ordered the papers and i had the wireless batteries charged.
Have issued the following gale warning.
Strong northwesterly gales all coasts of the british isles.
Rain in most districts, some hail or sleet locally.
Channel crossings extremely rough.
What are you looking at, Fred?
I was wondering if we could get a pram down that passage.
But are we going to be here?
What?
Why not?
When you get your new job as traveler for the firm, i'm going to a bigger, better house than this.
Oh, what do you want to move for?
There won't be enough room here.
Oh, i never heard of anything so ridiculous.
We've been here for all these years.
What do you want to move for?
That is the very reason why.
Grand Hotel. - The line is busy. Who is this?
I can connect you with room service.
Hello. Is that the clinic?
This is Senf, the head porter, Grand Hotel.
How's my wife? Is she in pain?
Isn't the child coming soon?
Patience? Would you have patience?
This is Otto Kringelein.
Is that you, Heinrich?
Listen. I've got to talk very quickly. Every minute costs 2 marks 90.
You know that will I made before I had my operation?
I want you to tear it up.
I came to Berlin to see a great specialist about that old trouble of mine, you know?
It's pretty bad, and he says I haven't long to live.
I say, he says I won't live much longer!
No, it isn't nice to be told things like that.
You plague, bother, and save, and all of a sudden you're dead.
I want to get something out of life.
I'm never going back to Friedersdorf. Never.
I'm staying here at the Grand Hotel.
It's the most expensive hotel in Berlin.
All the best people stay here.
Even our big boss, Preysing, is staying here.
I'm going to tell him someday just exactly what I think of him.
Hello, miss.
This is General Director Preysing.
I want my home in Friedersdorf, please.
Hurry.
Hello. Is that you, Mama?
How are the children?
What news have you from the factory, dear?
Is your papa there?
Good.
Hello, Papa, is that you?
The conference with the Saxonia company is set for tomorrow morning, Papa.
If the merger does not go through, we are in very bad shape, Papa.
Everything depends upon news from Manchester.
If the deal with the Manchester Cotton Company does not go through... we're facing a very bad situation, Papa.
I'm Suzette, Mme. Grusinskaya's maid.
Madame will not dance today.
She will not go to the rehearsal.
She did not sleep all night.
There is something preying on her mind.
I gave her a tablet, a Veronal. She's sleeping now.
This is Baron von Geigern.
Look here, I need money, or I can't stay at this hotel much longer.
I've laid the groundwork. I know the exact position of her room.
I've made friends with her ballet master, Pimenov.
Listen, Heinrich. I've taken all my savings, everything... and I'm going to enjoy spending it.
All of it.
It's terribly expensive here, Heinrich.
But it's wonderful.
I can't! I'll lose my job.
It's like being in jail.
Rely on me, Papa.
I will make this merger go through. I never fail.
Poor Madame.
Her mind is tortured.
I'm afraid she will....
I don't need advice, thanks very much. I need money!
Music all the time.
It's wonderful.
Grand Hotel.
People coming, going.
Nothing ever happens.
Mme. Grusinskaya will not want her car.
Mme. Grusinskaya's car is not to be brought.
Here. - Yes, Baron?
Adolphus is very vexed with you.
You didn't take him for his walk this morning.
Your door was locked.
You might have knocked.
Don't you realize?
That's why they don't like little dogs in big hotels.
The doors are locked. They can't get out. You see?
Yes, Baron.
I want you to take him for a good walk. - You understand?
Yes, Baron.
Don't bring him back till he's exhausted.
No, Baron. Wait a minute.
It's quite all right.
Is that for me? No. Mme. Grusinskaya's car is to be brought.
Mme. Grusinskaya's car is to be brought.
Will you send this to Mme. Grusinskaya? - Yes, Baron.
Good evening. My key, 168.
Good evening, Mr. Pimenov.
Good evening, Baron.
How is the beautiful lady? - Grusinskaya?
To tell the truth, Baron, tonight we're a little bit nervous.
Were you at the theater last night?
I'm always there when Grusinskaya dances.
Last night was not so good.
I thought she was splendid.
Is Mr. Preysing in?
I'm Dr. Zinnowitz.
Mr. Preysing. Visitor. - Mr. Preysing.
Here you are. - Sorry to have kept you waiting.
Waiting? I've been waiting for news from Manchester.
No news yet?
No news.
That's bad.
You can't hold out unless you merge with the Saxonia company.
I know.
The Saxonia company will never sign... unless your firm is tied up with the Manchester people.
I told you that. Yes, I know. I'm very much worried.
But I have my agent in Manchester.
I'm expecting a telegram any minute.
You have to create a good impression. Seem optimistic.
Don't even mention Manchester to the Saxonia crowd. Be clever.
No, I cannot do that, Dr. Zinnowitz.
I'm used to making my deals on a solid basis.
I'm an honest businessman, a good husband and a father.
I have nothing to conceal.
I could not live happily otherwise. Yes, I know.
We'll go someplace and talk it over.
I'm expecting a stenographer.
Send her to Mr. Preysing's room. 166. Yes, Dr. Zinnowitz.
Letters for me?
No, Doctor.
Telegrams?
No, Doctor.
He always seems to be waiting for something... but it never happens.
No messages? - No, Doctor.
Yes, I was in the war.
Your bill, Baron.
You're not beginning that again, are you?
Please pay some attention to me. I've no time.
Kindly wait one moment, sir.
Has anyone asked for me?
No, Doctor.
We're holding the rooms now. Five bedrooms, two sitting rooms.
How many in your party?
Let me see. My mother, two sisters...
Really, this is an imposition.
Sir, kindly wait one moment, please.
That makes nine. - Yes, madam.
You wish to have the rooms held? - Yes, please. And then...
Really, I won't wait any longer.
I've been here a very long time.
That's all right.
Look here, I waited three days before I got a room at all.
When I finally got one, what kind of a room was it?
A very nice room, and inexpensive.
I didn't ask you for a cheap room. When I came here to live, did I ask you for a cheap room? Did I?
If you wait one moment, sir...
I can't wait.
Every day is precious. Every hour...
176? - ...every minute is precious.
I came to live here for two weeks, maybe three. Heaven only knows.
I can pay whatever you want.
I'm tired and ill. I can't wait.
The gentleman has a complaint?
He is dissatisfied with Room 559.
Yes, I have a complaint. I think it's a perfectly fair complaint.
I came here from a great distance to live at the Grand Hotel.
I want a room, a big room.
The same kind of room you'd give General Director Preysing.
I'm as good as Mr. Preysing.
I can pay for a room the same as Mr. Preysing.
Would you stick him way off in a corner in a little room... where the water pipes go "pop" all day?
He can have my room.
It doesn't matter where I stay.
That won't be necessary, Doctor.
Mr. Kringelein will take Room 176.
It's one of our most expensive rooms.
A large room on the front, and with a bar.
With a private bar, exclusively mine.
Certainly, sir.
Exactly what I want. That's very kind. I'll pay for it now.
No, I beg of you, sir. - Pardon me, sir.
You dropped your little hat.
Permit me.
Thank you. Permit me.
My name is Kringelein, from Friedersdorf. - Yes.
I'm Baron von Geigern.
A Baron.
Permit me to present Dr. Otternschlag.
A doctor.
Doctor, I'm ill.
I know. When a man's collar is an inch too big for him, I know he's ill.
I must go and dress now. - I hope to see you at the theater. - Surely, sir.
Is this gentleman a baron, too?
Unfortunately, no.
Will Mr. Kringelein kindly sign here?
I have signed once.
Have you a minute?
I told you not to come into the lobby. Time's getting short.
Haven't I told you not talk to me with a cigarette in your mouth?
I want to speak...
Later.
Yes, sir.
This way, Mr. Kringelein.
Mr. Preysing.
Will you go up to 166?
166.
Hey, wait a minute!
Hello?
Mme. Grusinskaya's car is not to be brought.
She said, "On the other side of the fence."
Baron, you're incorrigible.
Poor Grusinskaya.
How can she receive anyone? She can't.
No, of course not.
Theater, hotels, trains. Trains, hotels, theater.
Quite so.
I must toddle along. - She'll be waking up and calling for me.
I'm sorry, old fellow.
Who are you, please?
I'm the stenographer.
Then you will please wait outside, please.
Yes, sir.
Outside, please.
Take your time.
Listen, the burial fund and everything. I've got it right here.
I'm going to live.
I'm going to have a good time while I can.
That's my creed, Kringelein:
a short life and a gay one.
A short life, Baron, and a gay one.
That's very true in my case.
You know, I know you won't think I'm impertinent... but perhaps you might have a little better time... if you bought some new clothes.
Started out fresh, so to speak.
Well, Baron, I didn't think there was time for that.
But it's very kind of you to take an interest.
Friends, then.
Friends, Baron?
Thank you.
Your room is ready, sir.
I may speak to the Baron anytime I see him?
Of course, Kringelein. Why not?
I mean, when you're with your smart friends?
I haven't any friends, Kringelein.
You said me, Baron.
Friend.
Bless you, Kringelein.
See you later.
I've often wondered what would happen to that porter... if somebody jumped on him from here.
I'm sure I don't know. Why don't you try it and find out?
Thanks very much.
Not at all.
Don't you like dancing?
No. Not with strangers.
Never?
Never.
Thanks very much.
Not at all.
Are you back again?
He must be an awful nice fellow.
Who?
Whoever's keeping you waiting.
Have you seen it?
Seen what?
It.
You don't mean 166?
That fat, bulbous neighbor of mine, Mister....
Preysing.
Not you.
Oh, no. Work.
Does he sing?
I hope not.
Weren't you playing something?
Yes. The typewriter.
You're a little stenographess.
Yes, I'm a little stenographess.
That's fascinating.
I don't suppose you'd take some dictation from me sometime, would you?
How about some tea, then?
Tea would spoil my dinner.
I only have one meal a day, and I'd rather hate to spoil it.
Are you reducing?
Reducing?
Me?
Do I need to?
No. It's perfect.
I don't think I've ever....
But why one meal a day?
Money. Ever heard of it?
Yes, I have, vaguely. But I always thought little stenographers made little pennies.
Very little.
That's too bad.
Did you ever see a stenographer with a decent frock on?
I have, indeed.
One she'd bought herself?
I see what you mean.
Poor kid.
I wish I were free tonight.
Aren't you?
What?
Free.
No, darn it, I'm not.
But there's tomorrow.
What time tomorrow?
5:00, downstairs.
Where downstairs?
In the funny yellow room where they dance.
You're funny.
Tomorrow?
Of course.
Really?
We'll dance?
All right.
We'll dance.
I wonder if I could remind the Baron of his promise... that I might speak to him at any time?
Mr. Kringelein, how are you making out in the royal suite?
Wonderfully, thanks to the Baron.
Baron? - Are you a baron?
Strangely enough, yes.
Then this isn't the Baroness?
Strangely enough, no.
Do I look like a baroness?
You're attractive enough to be anything.
Thank you, Baron. You're nice.
Thank you, Miss....
Miss Flaemm.
Miss Flaemm, this is Mr. Kringelein.
They call me Flaemmchen.
I like that better.
I wonder if the Baron would take the trouble to come to my beautiful room?
I've ordered some caviar and champagne. It's very expensive, but that doesn't matter.
Perhaps Miss Flaemm would join us.
Have caviar, if you like, but it tastes like herring to me.
It does, as a matter of fact. I hadn't thought of that.
I'm sure my beautiful room... will appeal to your artistic sense.
It has real velvet upholstery.
A-number one. I'm in the textile trade, and I know.
I wonder if you'd like to see my bathroom?
It has hot and cold running water all day.
Nighttime, too. I can have a bath anytime that I like.
Yes.
Stenographer. Please.
Her master's voice.
Goodbye, Mr. Kringelein.
Thank you.
Goodbye, funny one.
Don't forget tomorrow. 5:00.
I won't. Goodbye, you. - Goodbye.
What's the matter, Mr. Kringelein?
Preysing.
You know him, don't you? - I know him?
I've slaved in that man's factory for years and years.
I know him through and through.
Sorry, old man.
I beg your pardon, Baron. Excuse me.
Won't you join me in my room?
I've ordered some champagne.
Listen, I'd love to. I'll join you a little later.
You know the gentleman we met downstairs, with the face?
Who? The doctor, you mean?
He's a gay old blade, isn't he? - He's wonderful.
Please, Messieurs, Madame is asleep.
See you later.
Waiter!
Please.
Sorry.
Has Madame slept well?
No, I've been awake, thinking.
It is time for the performance.
I think, Suzette...
I've never been so tired in my life.
Not even the Veronal can help me to sleep.
Mme. Grusinskaya's car is to be brought.
I can't dance tonight.
It will pass, Madame.
Pearls are cold.
Everything is cold and finished.
So far away.
So threadbare.
The Russians.
Saint Petersburg.
Imperial court.
The Grand Duke Sergei....
Sergei... is dead.
It's all gone. Mon Dieu.
The pearls, if they were to break.... The pearls don't break.
They hold together and bring me bad luck.
I hate them.
Orchids again, Madame! No card.
I think they are perhaps from the same young man.
He is at the end of the corridor. Tall.
He walks like a soldier.
Madame must have noticed how often he rides in the elevator with us.
Yes? Oui.
Madame, the car is here.
Send it away. I shan't need it.
Mme. Grusinskaya will not require her car. No.
She'll not be going to the theater.
Time for the performance.
The performance.
Poor little Lisebeta.
She still has her stage fright. It will pass.
It's not stage fright. It's something more.
What?
What is it?
Last night there was no applause.
There was.
That theater, half empty.
Dancing for those few.
I was frantic.
I finished, I waited, I listened... but the applause did not come.
They're past, Pimenov.
They're dead. It's finished.
Meierheim. Madame!
In negligée an hour before the performance.
What's this, you're canceling your car?
Do you know the time, or are we all mad?
Am I your manager? Have we contracts? Have we obligations?
Is this the time, or I am blind?
I'm canceling the engagement.
Madame is canceling the engagement?
Madame has chosen a funny time for such a funny joke.
Tonight there is a line in front of the theater since 6:00.
The house is jammed to the roof.
Is it really full?
Doesn't Meierheim say so?
Packed to the ceiling.
And such an audience:
the French ambassador, American millionaires, Princess Retski...
All right.
Hurry, Suzette.
We'll wait outside.
Poor child.
How is the house?
Terrible.
After this, no more ballets for me. Jazz. Just jazz.
If the house is empty again.... I don't know.
When she gets her paint on, hears the music, she'll be fine. I know these people.
Here she is.
Why did you bring the pearls?
I said I won't wear them.
Why not? - Take them back. - Hurry up.
I don't think I'll be able to join you fellows after all.
Why not? We'll wait.
Come on.
Lift, please. - Wait.
Can I help?
You go ahead, old man.
I'll be there if I'm up for it. - We'll meet anyway.
Mme. Grusinskaya's car.
Mme. Grusinskaya's car is to be brought.
The car is here, Madame.
Hello. Fifth floor. Good evening.
It's just 9:30, madam. Yes.
I'll send them up at once.
Is he in? - The Baron? - Yes.
Adolphus, I have something very serious to discuss with you.
When you meet lady dogs on the street that are not dachshunds... you must exercise some self-control.
We have company.
You're late. The dancer's gone to the theater.
Excuse me, I'm busy.
This is a very peculiar thing for one gentleman to say to another... but as a matter of fact... you're the one thing in the world I really love.
She's gone to the theater. Don't you know?
What are you going to do?
The pearls are in her room.
The others are getting suspicious. I had Amsterdam on the phone.
They think you're scared.
I've been careful. I'm waiting my chance.
Waiting your chance? You're too much of a gentleman, that's the trouble.
I told you I'd get those pearls tonight, didn't I? - Need any help? - No.
Have you got the skeleton key? - No.
Why not?
One reason: there's a perfectly charming floor clerk outside who sees everything.
She'd see me enter her room.
I can take care of her.
Chloroform on a handkerchief while you're on the job.
No.
Why not? Poor kid. In the first place, it would give her a rotten headache.
I know all about chloroform. I had it in the war.
Besides, she's rather pretty.
She has a very nice line...
You're no good for this business.
No? - To you it's just a joke.
I don't like your tone.
No?
No. Get out.
Leave her to me.
Be ready to leave on the night train for Amsterdam.
With the pearls.
With the pearls.
Get out.
There is a nasty man, Adolphus.
He'd eat his young.
Both parties have fully agreed that this merger can only result...
in mutual advantages.
Moreover...."
Did you get that?
Yes, I got it.
What did you say Zinnowitz called you?
Flaemmchen.
Flaemm?
That's odd. - What?
I mean, who were the gentlemen you were talking to in the corridor?
Some people I know.
You know a lot of gentlemen, don't you?
Oh, not many. I haven't time. I'm busy now looking for a job.
I'd love to be in the movies.
Why the movies particularly? I mean....
...only in mutual advantages.
Moreover...."
You're a very unusual stenographer.
You're pretty enough to do other things.
I do.
What?
You see, I have a rather nice figure, and I pose a lot. Art studies, you know?
Like that?
I got 10 marks for it.
Is that you?
Well, isn't that interesting?
That's lovely.
Moreover...."
Moreover, the possibility of the successful accommodation...
for the Cotton Company...
should throw a great weight into the balance...."
Balance."
Your hands are sunburned, aren't they?
Yes, that's from skiing.
From skiing?
A friend of mine took me to Switzerland last month.
To Switzerland?
That must have been very nice.
I went to Florence once, too.
With the same man?
No.
Don't misunderstand me, Miss Flaemm.
I'm a married man and have grown-up daughters... - All right. - ...bigger than you are.
Come in.
That's all.
Excuse me, please.
Deal with Manchester definitely off." Is that something terrible?
It doesn't mean that at all.
That's a mistake.
All right. I'm sorry.
Do you want to go on?
No.
You come back in the morning... and we will go on with the dictation before the conference.
If you find out you won't need me in the morning...
I wish you'd please let me know... because men like you who come in and out of town are often unreliable.
After all, if I don't work tomorrow....
Well, good night.
Deal definitely off."
Why, we could be smashed.
I'm going into 170 now, madam.
Hello? No.
There's no one here. You're late.
What have you been doing?
Everyone says, "Come back." They won't get out of their rooms.
Housekeeper speaking.
No, she isn't here.
Western Theater?
Have you seen Madame?
Hello. Mr. Pimenov?
Have you found her?
No, she isn't here. Yes, I know...
Pimenov? What's happening?
No, I haven't found her.
Who's dancing?
Duprez?
How was it? Good.
All right. You keep the show going.
This trick is going to cost Madame a suit for breach of contract.
Madame is ill. Her nerves...
What about my nerves? Who is she? Where does she think she is, Russia?
I want to be alone.
Where have you been?
I suppose I can cancel the Vienna contract.
I just want to be alone.
You're going to be very much alone, my dear Madame. This is the end.
Shall I....
Does Madame wish....
No, Suzette.
All right.
Western Theater, please.
Mr. Pimenov, the ballet master.
Grusinskaya.
Hello, Pimenov. I'm at the hotel.
I couldn't go on.
I couldn't.
How is it going?
Who's dancing?
Duprez?
Well, how is it?
I see.
They didn't miss me at all.
Good night, Pimenov.
They didn't even miss me.
Yes.
I'm sorry. I've finished.
Finished.
I always said I'd leave off when the time came.
And who would trouble about a Grusinskaya... who dances no more?
What would she do?
Grow orchids?
Keep white peacocks?
Die.
That's what it comes to at last: to die.
I'm not going to wait.
Don't be alarmed, Madame.
Who are you?
Someone who happened to be hiding in your room.
Why?
I often come here when you're at the theater.
Why?
Just to be alone in your room, to breathe the air you breathe.
There's no need to call for help. Permit me.
I couldn't help hearing. I couldn't help knowing what you were about to do just now.
I could have left by the window, unnoticed, but I risked being discovered.
May I say something, Madame?
You're so beautiful.
It tore my heart to see you in despair like that.
What on earth have they been doing to you?
You've everything to live for.
Please don't cry anymore.
You must forgive me.
I've had a very trying evening.
I was so alone, and suddenly you were there.
Why do you look at me like that?
I had no idea you were so beautiful.
I'd like to take you in my arms and not let anything happen to you, ever.
How tired you are.
Yes, tired.
And alone?
So alone.
You mustn't talk Russian to me.
Strange man.
Am I so strange to you?
Maybe not so strange now.
You know, once, when the Grand Duke was alive...
I found a man hiding in my room, a young officer.
Later on, they found him dead.
Well, that was Russia.
Who are you?
Someone who can love you, that's all.
Someone who has forgotten everything else but you.
You could love me?
I've never seen anything in my life as beautiful as you are.
You must go now.
I'm not going.
You know I'm not going.
Please let me stay.
But I want to be alone.
That isn't true. You don't want to be alone. You were in despair just now.
I can't leave you now.
You mustn't cry anymore.
You must forget. Let me stay.
Just for a little while.
Please let me stay.
For just a minute, then.
No, Doctor.
The champagne, and those girls and their dancing... those beautiful silver things, and the ice, and the caviar....
Oh, Doctor.
I don't care.
It's life.
Life. Mr. Kringelein, you are drunk. - Good night.
Good night.
No. My room. - Yes, Doctor.
Mr. Kringelein, you're drunk.
Life.
Grand Hotel.
Grand Hotel, good morning.
Baron von Geigern's room does not answer.
Yes, all right.
Baron von Geigern's chauffeur calling?
Grand Hotel, good morning.
930, Dr. Otternschlag.
No, Doctor. No messages.
Grand Hotel, 820.
Grand Hotel, good morning.
Who is calling Mme. Grusinskaya?
Mr. Pimenov.
Mme. Grusinskaya cannot be disturbed.
Mr. Preysing's calls to 162 for the day.
162. - The conference room.
That is interesting. A man in the textile industry must know Manchester.
There's a lot of business to be done with the Manchester Cotton Company.
They have the whole English market right in their hands.
Have you any connections with Manchester?
We have a lot of good connections in England.
Actually... - I mean, with the Manchester people.
Please, we are here to discuss the merger. Let us begin at the beginning.
Yes. - Thank you.
Is Baron von Geigern in?
Too bad.
Since June 11 this year, when the first negotiation...
I met him yesterday.
...between our respective firms...
I've got a date. ...that this merger can result....
About 5:00. - ...all of us.
Dancing.
All we want to know about is Manchester.
Just a second.
Before I get through, I'm laying before you here... the last general statement of the concern.
The capital, the plant, the machinery....
For instance, we'll take mop rags. - I'll call you back.
All we want to know about is Manchester.
Yes, Mr. Preysing, that's what we want to know.
I would rather wait for Justice Zinnowitz... before I commit myself, please.
Now, to go ahead with the merger.
You realize... that this merger is a great advantage to the Saxonians, of course.
Now, let's talk like adults.
When you first approached us...
We did not approach you.
This letter filed on September 15 indicates you approached us.
That letter is a response to a tentative feeler sent out by you.
Please.
Tentative, my foot!
A month before this, your old father-in-law... - comes to me privately, and scratches... - Scratched?
Why, we did not take the initiative!
You did... - We did not take the initiative!
You took the initiative! Gentlemen, I see the conference has already begun.
I'm glad you're here, Justice Zinnowitz.
Good morning.
Thank you very much.
I beg your pardon, please. Excuse me, please.
I am glad you're here.
These gentlemen have cross words.
Would you try, Justice Zinnowitz... - and iron out the situation here? - Certainly.
Right here, on the top. - If you will allow me. Thank you.
Well, gentlemen, the situation seems to be perfectly clear. - Yes.
And how clear is Manchester?
Manchester?
Have you said anything about Manchester, Mr. Preysing?
Why, no, sir. I cannot commit myself at this time about Manchester.
Quite right.
Well, gentlemen, since June 11 of this year... when the first negotiations for a merger were entered...
Now we're going to begin at the beginning again.
As you remember it, when you approached us...
We did not approach you.
I'm sorry, you did approach us!
We did not approach you. - You approached us!
Can you imagine 100 girls in a ballet school... each thinking she would become the most famous dancer in the world?
I was ambitious then.
We were drilled like little soldiers.
No rest, no stopping.
I was little, slim, but hard as a diamond.
Then I became famous soon.
But why am I telling you all this?
Last night I didn't know you at all.
Who are you, really?
What? I don't even know your name.
I am Felix Benvenuto Frihern von Geigern.
My mother called me Flix.
No. Flix.
That's sweet.
And how do you live?
What kind of person are you?
I'm a prodigal son, the black sheep of a white flock.
I shall die on the gallows. - Really?
Really.
I haven't a bit of character.
No. Really.
You know, when I was a little boy I was taught to ride and be a gentleman.
Then at school, to pray and lie.
And then in the war, to kill and hide. That's all.
And what do you do now?
Now I'm a gambler... running at large, like a happy pig... devouring everything of life that pleases me.
I really belong in jail.
What a picture.
And what else?
What else?
I'm also a criminal and a hotel thief.
That's not a funny joke.
You must believe one thing.
You must believe that I love you.
That I've never known love like this until now.
What is it, Flix? What's the matter?
Hotel thief.
No.
Did you come here just for these? That's horrible.
You may keep the pearls.
I don't want them.
I will not denounce you. Hadn't you better go now?
I wanted money desperately.
Can't you understand that?
That's why I wanted your pearls.
I was threatened. I was desperately in need of a certain big sum of money.
I've been following you. I've admired you.
But last night, at last, I managed to come into your room.
And now....
And now?
I couldn't go through with it.
Don't you understand? Don't you?
Suzette, Madame.
Good morning. - Good morning, Madame.
Did Madame sleep well?
Yes, Suzette. Come back in five minutes. I'll call you.
There, it begins.
Hello, Pimenov.
Good morning.
Darling.
Beautiful morning.
Yes, very well. Rehearsals?
All right, you can come.
Goodbye.
I have to go to rehearsals.
Our train leaves early tomorrow morning. - Our train?
Yes, for Vienna.
Vienna? - You're coming with me.
Of course you are. - But I can't.
I'd give my soul to go, but I can't.
Why couldn't you? - I'll try.
There might be some way.
Flix, is it money?
Of course. I have money.
I have enough for both of us. No.
That would spoil everything.
I'll manage somehow. I'll get it. I have a whole day.
I'll be on the train.
I shall dance, and you'll be with me.
Then we'll go to Tremezzo. I have a villa there.
The sun will shine.
I'll take a vacation, six weeks, eight weeks. I don't know.
We'll be happy and lazy.
And then we'll go to South America.
It will be divine.
Be careful going to your room.
I'll be on the train with the money. Don't do anything foolish.
I'm alarmed about you.
Don't worry. I'll be on the train.
Hurry, Suzette. A bright dress.
It's a sunny morning.
Meierheim is canceling the Vienna engagement.
Meierheim is mad. You are mad.
We're all mad. Suzette, come.
Gru, you're positively radiant.
Pimenov, I have an idea, a ballet.
It must have mad music.... But I'll speak with you later. You go to the theater.
I want a full rehearsal, ballet, full orchestra.... - Come, Suzette.
But, Madame....
Will you get me Baron von Geigern, please?
Yes.
Baron von Geigern.
Chéri, it's you.
No, nothing.
Good morning.
No. Just to tell you that I'm happy.
I'll have something sweet and cold, please.
Louisiana Flip, sir?
Louisiana Flip?
Yes, that sounds very nice. Thank you.
What do you do in the Grand Hotel?
Eat, sleep, loaf around... flirt a little, dance a little.
A hundred doors leading to one hall.
No one knows anything about the person next to them.
And when you leave, someone occupies your room... lies in your bed.
That's the end.
Let me say again, for the tenth time... you people were quite ready for the merger.
You declared yourself fully agreed on all the terms.
Why should the signing of these articles be suddenly held up?
I'll admit that we were at one time anxious for this merger.
But since then, the Preysing Company has fallen on evil days.
Evil days? - Very evil days.
Say, listen.
Haven't I just shown you here... what my firm exports to the Balkans?
50,000 marks worth of mop rags each and every year.
Mop rags.
We're interested in something entirely different. - What?
Shall I tell them again?
Why waste time? It's getting late.
You see... - We're going home.
But Mr. Preysing has too great a regard for the certainty...
You've been talking all day. You're hoarse now.
Good night, Preysing.
You have decided against the merger?
Yes.
The deal is off?
Yes.
Thank you.
Here, let me help you. - Thank you.
Preysing, I hope you pull through.
It's a very bad time to be in such a crisis. Sorry. - Dining in town?
No, I have to get my train.
Here!
So you're breaking off the negotiations.
All right.
But don't you think for one moment that I'm such a fool... as not to have something to say about Manchester.
What?
Manchester? No.
The deal is over. Good night, gentlemen.
If you have something definite to say about Manchester, we might...
I'm at liberty to announce at this time that the deal between my firm... and the Manchester Cotton Company... has been successfully negotiated.
Are you joking? Under those circumstances....
Where are those articles?
I thought it was all over.
Under these circumstances, it's a different matter.
Yes, but under these circumstances we might refuse to sign now. Now, come, come.
Business is business.
Now, I'll sign in here. Preysing, you sign here.
We should celebrate this with a bottle of wine.
We'll see you next week and settle all the details.
Next week.
Yes. - Come on.
Good night, Preysing. You're a sly one.
Dr. Waitz?
I'll be at your office tomorrow.
You let me talk myself hoarse... and you had Manchester signed up all the time.
Why?
The deal has been put through.
Yeah. The deal has been put through.
What's the matter with you?
Here.
Deal with Manchester definitely... "definitely off." Preysing!
Yes, if that's what the world wants, bluff...
I can be just as big a bluff as anyone.
You must go to England yourself at once and really see this through!
Yes, I must go to England.
I was desperate. I didn't know what I was doing. Now I don't care.
This thing goes to a man's head.
What you need is some relaxation.
Yeah! That's it!
I want to break loose.
I want to maybe go dancing.
I want to do anything.
I can understand that, after this....
Yes, go on, say it. My lie.
But that's the first time in 30 years that....
Where is my stenographer?
Miss Flaemm?
What do you want with her?
Pardon?
What do you want?
What?
Here.
I want to do some dictating.
I want to tell my father-in-law about...
She had an engagement in the Yellow Room at 5:00.
She was in a hurry.
In the Yellow Room? - Yes.
Do you think that she's pretty?
Pretty as a picture.
You think so?
Let's go find her. We'll go get a drink.
You come along, Zinnowitz. - Yes. I don't know much about women.
I've been married for 28 years, you know.
Come along, Zinnowitz.
Good evening, Mr. Kringelein.
Good evening, Miss Flaemm.
Have you seen the Baron?
I'm waiting for him. I've been with him all day.
We had a marvelous time. We were in a motor car, 100 miles an hour, in an airplane.
Really? - We had a marvelous time.
My, how you've changed. You look awfully nice.
Thank you, Miss Flaemm. I had a manicure, too.
Really?
I'm sorry, Miss Flaemm.
Would you have something to drink?
A Louisiana Flip.
Louisiana Flip, please.
Absinthe.
Oh, that.
You like music, Mr. Kringelein?
Yes. I love it.
It's so stimulating.
A man could...
A man could what?
He could do almost anything.
Hello, funny one. - Hello.
Sorry I'm late.
Baron, won't you have a drink?
A Louisiana Flip.
Mr. Kringelein, how are you now?
I feel a little strange, Baron.
I'd given you up. - Sorry.
Please, Baron, do have a drink.
A Louisiana Flip.
No, thanks, old man.
I'm keeping my head clear.
Dance, then? - What?
Dance?
Yes, I'd love to.
Watch this, will you, Mr. Kringelein?
I really ought to learn to dance. I suppose it's very important.
Yes, you should learn as quickly as the time allows.
Believe me, Mr. Kringelein, a man who is not with a woman... is a dead man.
What have you been doing all day?
Chasing around. - Chasing what?
Money.
You were very different yesterday.
That was yesterday.
I served as a surgeon in the Great War... till the end.
Grenade in my face.
I carried diphtheria bacilli in the wound till 1920.
Isolated two years.
Drink, Mr. Kringelein.
Yes.
That was lovely.
Listen, funny one, do you want to make a man happy? - I'd love to.
Dance with old Kringelein.
Why?
I don't know. He's a dear old duck.
I feel rather sorry for him, don't you?
You know, you're not a bit like you were yesterday.
Yesterday?
No, perhaps not.
I fell in love last night.
The real thing.
There's no real thing.
It just doesn't exist.
I thought that, too.
It's wonderful.
Come along.
Dance with old Kringelein?
Of course. Anything for you. You're sweet.
Here you are. I must speak with you.
Presently, Mr. Preysing.
No, now. This is very urgent.
This lady has urgent business with me at the moment.
Insolence. Berlin manners.
Good evening, Mr. Preysing.
You're staying here, too?
I'm sorry, but I cannot place you.
Kringelein, at the plant.
One of our agents. No.
Assistant bookkeeper, Room 23, Building C, third floor.
I am away, sick.
That's very interesting.
Good day.
Would you like to dance with me, Mr. Kringelein?
Miss Flaemm, I've never danced in public.
Come along and try it.
I'd be afraid.
There's nothing to be afraid of. You'll love it.
Miss Flaemmchen, I must speak to you. This is about a dictating job.
When do we start? Tomorrow morning?
No, right now.
We were just going to dance.
Do you know each other? Mr. Kringelein, Mr. Preysing.
Mr. Kringelein would be a good friend and not accept your invitation to dance.
I couldn't think of not accepting the invitation to dance.
I understood you to say that you reported to our plant ill... and you're here in Berlin indulging in diversions... which are very much beyond your means?
This is very extraordinary, Mr. Kringelein.
I think we should look over your books.
Come along now, children.
No fighting. Save that for the office.
Does the world belong to you, Mr. Preysing?
Haven't I got any right to live?
I will wait 10 minutes for you.
If you're not back, it will be necessary to engage someone else.
What happened to your dance?
We're going now, thank you, Baron. Come along.
I shall remember this, Mr. Kringelein.
Let the poor devil alone. Death's staring him in the face.
I did not ask your advice.
I think you'd better go away.
We will see who will remain here the longer.
Baron von Geigern, please.
Mr. Kringelein, you must look at my face, and not the floor.
Yes.
Why, you're trembling.
I never danced in public before.
You dance beautifully. - Thank you.
That's right.
I'm happy, Miss Flaemm.
Are you really?
For the first time in my life, I'm happy.
Are you all right? Yes.
Excuse me, I just stopped a second.
All right. Here we go.
I'm very tired. Do you mind if we stop?
Thank you.
I must go back to Mr. Preysing now.
Must you?
Yes, business. One has to earn a living, you know.
Not you, Miss Flaemm.
Just another desk slave.
Money.
I'm glad you're here, Miss Flaemm.
Here I am.
Yes, thank you. - Excuse me. Go away, please.
Where's the Louisiana Flip?
You wanted to see me? Yes.
You may go, Mr. Kringelein.
Mr. Preysing, I am not taking orders from you here.
What is this insolence? Please go away.
You think you have free license to be insulting?
Believe me, you have not.
You think you're superior, but you're quite an ordinary man... even if you did marry money... and people like me have got to slave for you... for 320 marks a month.
Go away, please. You are annoying.
You don't like to see me enjoying myself. When a man's working himself to death, that's what he's paid for.
You don't care if a man can live on his wages or not.
You have a very regular scale of wages, and there's the sick fund for you.
What a scale, and what a fund.
When I was sick for four weeks... you wrote me a letter telling me I'd be discharged... if I were sick any longer.
Did you write me that letter or not?
I have no idea of the letters that I write.
I know that you are here in the Grand Hotel, living like a lord.
You are probably an embezzler.
An embezzler!
Yes, an embezzler.
You are going to take that back!
Right here in the presence of this young lady!
Who do you think you're talking to? You think I'm dirt?
If I'm dirt, you're a lot dirtier...
Mr. Industrial Magnate Preysing!
You're discharged. Get out!
You can't do that to him.
I don't know the man or what he wants. I never saw him before.
I know you.
I've kept your books for you, and I know all about you.
If one of your employees was half as stupid in a small way... - as you are in a big way...
What do you mean?
Gentlemen, please!
Please!
Stop that!
You're discharged!
Do you hear? - Wait!
You can't discharge me.
I'm my own master... for the first time in my life.
You can't discharge me.
I'm sick.
I'm going to die. You understand?
I'm going to die, and nobody can do anything to me anymore.
Nothing can happen to me anymore.
Before I can be discharged, I'll be dead!
The man's crazy.
I don't know him.
He's annoying. - Baron!
Excuse me. - What is it?
What's happened to him?
He's ill.
I'm sorry, Baron.
Poor old Kringelein. You're all right.
Give him some whiskey.
A Louisiana Flip.
Five minutes to 7:00.
Time drags when you're tired.
I was in the hospital the whole night, walking up and down the corridor.
They wouldn't let me see her. And I have to stay chained to this desk.
Did you find that young lady for Mr. Preysing?
His secretary. Yes, they're over there. - That's all.
His secretary.
Come on, waiter.
Would you like a little cognac?
No, nothing. Nothing?
One cognac for me.
Very good, sir.
You wanted to see me? Yes. Pardon me.
I must go to England. It's very important. I must go at once.
I have some very big deals... involving hundreds of thousands of marks... and I thought I would take along a secretary... to take care of my correspondence.
You know what I mean.
I understood you to say that you traveled and....
You understand?
I understand you perfectly, Mr. Preysing.
What would you want for such a trip?
Marks?
You mean money?
I don't know. I'd have to figure it up.
I'd need clothes and shoes... and it's cold in England in March.
You'd want me to look nice?
Of course, Miss Flaemm.
Yes, I thought you would.
I should say 1,000 marks.
Is that too much?
No.
That is all right.
Would you like me to get you a room here... at the hotel? Now?
And that would...
Hello, Baron.
Would you please pay some attention?
I'm paying attention.
How do you do?
Insolence.
You mean the Baron?
Baron what?
What?
He's a gentleman.
Is the Baron tired?
No, not tired exactly.
I thought this evening we could go to the casino.
That place we passed with the wonderful bright lights.
Kringelein, I'd adore it. I can't go anywhere. - What?
I'm broke.
No, you're joking. - Yes.
Isn't it odd?
A baron, broke.
Excuse me, old man.
I quit. - You can't. I'm not getting those pearls, neither are you.
What about the money?
I'll pay you back. - How?
I have an idea working in my head.
You might find a bullet through that head.
If you do that you'll get nothing, except maybe the police after you. Mme. Grusinskaya's car!
If you wait, I'll pay you back your 5,000...
I'll see you later.
Go on, Suzette.
Are you coming to the theater?
I shall dance tonight. How I shall dance! I want to feel that you're there.
I'm worried about you. - Don't be.
You'll be on the train?
Yes.
Until then.
Bless you.
Was the Baron joking?
What?
Is it really true?
What are you talking about, Kringelein?
Is the Baron really in financial straits?
To tell you the truth, I must get some money somehow right away.
If the Baron will permit me.
What?
I'd be awfully glad to oblige.
You've been very decent to me.
Three hundred?
If I could get into a game of some kind, I think I might win.
Gambling!
I'd love that!
I've got over 6,800 marks right here.
If we could scare up some men to play.
We could go up to my room.
That's a grand idea.
Come on.
Cab, miss?
What?
Cab?
No, thanks. I'll walk.
4,000 marks.
4,000!
Too high?
4,000 marks.
Want a card?
Please.
Thanks.
8,000 marks.
8,000!
I take it all.
That's a lot of money.
Want a card?
Please.
Baccarat.
Too bad there.
Now, Mr. Kringelein.
Baron!
Will you help me again, please?
I think you'd better help me, Kringelein.
Make your bets, gentlemen. - How much shall I bet?
How much is left in the bank?
2,500 uncovered.
Do you feel like going that far?
All that money, Baron?
Come on, you're killing them tonight. Go ahead, old man.
Do you want a card? What have you got?
The old highwayman. He has nine again.
I win again!
Come on, gentlemen. Please drink!
Drink.
It's wonderful and sweet champagne!
Mr. Kringelein, care to take the bank?
Surely. I'll take everything.
I'll take anything.
Come on, now. Drink, gentlemen.
Please drink some champagne. It's expensive and good.
What will I take the bank for?
I'll play for 500.
Baron, all at once?
Suppose you lose it?
It's all the same thing, Kringelein. Come on, now, old man.
Deal me two cards.
One to me first. One to yourself.
One to me. One to yourself.
Baron, if all that money....
What have you got?
I've got a nine!
Isn't that a wonderful thing?
Kringelein, you old robber, you're hopeless.
Baron!
Baron, please.
It's no use, old man. It's sweet of you... - but you have all the luck.
It's true.
I have luck, for the first time in my life! I have luck!
Baron, are you out?
Have you finished playing?
Yes, thank you. I'll recover again presently, in 10 or 20 years.
Look, Doctor.
I've won again!
There you are.
Baron, I win and drink, and drink and win!
Gentlemen, please don't go.
Be my guests.
Don't go.
I beg your pardon.
I know I oughtn't to presume, but I'm so grateful to you. It's been so marvelous.
For the first time in my life, I've gambled and I've danced.
You gentlemen can laugh... but for the first time in my life, I've tasted life!
Splendid!
Life is wonderful, but it's very dangerous.
If you have the courage to live it, it's marvelous.
Wonderful! - You don't know about that.
You're healthy and happy.
But I, believe me... if a man doesn't know death, he doesn't know life.
It's a short life, but a gay one.
Please, gentlemen, don't go. Come on.
Drink to life... to the magnificent, dangerous... brief, wonderful life.
Kringelein!
And the courage to live it.
You know, I've only lived since last night... but that little while seems longer than all the time that's gone before.
All of....
Take him over to his bed.
Turn him around.
How is he, Doctor?
It will be over in a minute.
Over?
It's only just begun.
Quiet, Kringelein. Don't be afraid.
I'm not afraid, Doc.
I'm not afraid to die.
There, there. You'll be all right.
Too much iced champagne.
What?
Hello, Baron.
Hello, Kringelein.
You old drunkard.
It's late.
What is it?
My pocketbook.
I've lost my pocketbook.
14,000 marks in that pocketbook. - I've got to find it.
No, stay where you are.
No, I've got to find that.
Kringelein! - 14,000 marks.
14,000 marks were in that pocketbook.
I can't see anything.
You don't know what that money means to a man like me.
You've never lived like a dog in a hole... and scrimped and saved.
You did not see his pocketbook, did you, Baron?
No.
My life hangs on that money, Baron.
Nobody ever gives you anything for nothing.
You have to buy everything, and pay cash for it.
I wanted to pay for my last days with that money.
I must find it!
I haven't anything in the world but that pocketbook!
Every hour costs money.
I must find it!
Here's your pocketbook, you silly old thing. - There's your money.
You found it!
That's it. You found it.
I'm very glad he got it back. 14,000 marks.
Yes. It's a lot of money, isn't it?
Good night, Kringelein.
Don't go, Baron. Don't leave me.
I must, old man. It's late, I'm sorry.
No. Please don't go!
I must, old man.
It's late.
Good night.
Good night, Kringelein.
Stay a while, Baron.
I'm sorry. I can't, old man.
I have no time.
Wait a minute.
Hello, funny one.
Hello.
What are you doing here at this time?
Looking for my room. 164.
Do you live here?
Yes, for tonight.
Such is life, Flaemmchen.
You're nice.
Good night... funny one.
Good night.
Come on.
Thank you, madam.
Good night.
You were superb tonight.
What a success!
Yes. It was a triumph, wasn't it?
Madame will return to Berlin soon?
Who knows, monsieur?
Do be sensible.
Shall I come and talk about the music now, or not?
No.
Not tonight.
Pimenov, go and find him.
Flaemmchen.
Hello.
I've been waiting in there for you.
I had to arrange about the trip.
You're very sweet.
Thank you.
Won't you sit down?
You know, you are entirely different from what I expected.
Different?
How?
I don't know.
I thought you were more of a coquette... not so ladylike.
What did you expect?
Wouldn't you like to call me by the first name?
No, I couldn't do that.
Why not?
I don't know.
One can't get intimate just offhand.
I could go to England with you and all that, but....
I always say that nothing should be left hanging over.
And names are like that.
Supposing I met you next year and I said: "How do you do, Mr. Preysing."
And you said, "That's the young lady who was my secretary in Manchester."
That's all quite proper.
But supposing I saw you and yelled:
Hi, baby! Remember Manchester?"
And you were with your wife.
How would you like that?
We will leave my wife out of this, Flaemmchen, please.
Sorry.
I didn't mean that.
You are very slender, aren't you?
Think so?
Are you going to be nice to me?
Yes.
Very nice?
That's what you expect, isn't it?
You like me just a little bit, don't you?
You're still a stranger to me, but that doesn't matter.
It's you, Baron.
What are you doing in this room here?
This your room, Preysing?
Yes, this is my room.
Sorry.
I must've made a mistake.
We shall see whether you made a mistake or not.
That door is locked, Baron. Yes.
I came through here. Here.
I want that pocketbook.
What do you mean?
I want that pocketbook. Give it to me!
Certainly.
So that's how we stand, Baron.
Look here, Preysing... I'm completely at your mercy.
I was desperate.
It's a matter of life and death.
I had to get some money tonight, somehow.
Yes, you did have to get some money tonight... but you're going to jail. You're going to be locked up.
Why, you're a thief!
Be quiet.
Quiet?
Yeah, quiet!
You danced with Flaemmchen when I wanted to transact business with her.
You, the nice friend of the nice Mr. Kringelein.
Do you want to wake up the entire hotel?
I will wake up the hotel! I'll show them what a baron you are.
You are a thief! I'll have you locked up. Here, you wait here.
Thief! You!
Strike me, would you?
Hello. Operator.
Operator. They're having a nice little game up there with that telephone.
Oh, God.
Baron! Speak to me!
Baron.
He tried to rob me. He's a thief.
Here, Miss Flaemm.
Miss Flaemm, please don't leave me.
Please, Miss Flaemm.
Look! - What a grand hotel!
Hurry up.
They're waiting. - She was in a hurry.
No wonder she was running.
Mr. Kringelein!
Wake up!
Hear me?
Wake up!
The Baron.
The Baron?
Go quickly. The Baron.
Do you hear me?
Where?
Preysing's room.
Hurry!
Here. Take it.
You thief, you.
I must get out of here.
Mr. Kringelein, he robbed me.
He struck me. He's dead.
Baron.
Dead, just like that. Look.
His eyes are still open.
He looks so peaceful.
It can't be so hard to die.
That pocketbook he stole from me.
It's just like it was.
I haven't touched nothing.
Maybe he did try to take your pocketbook... but you don't kill a man for that.
You don't kill a man about a pocketbook.
Poor Baron, he wanted money so badly.
Where is Miss Flaemm?
I'll take care of her.
That's it. She's working with that man.
She enticed me into her room while he robbed me here.
I'll tell that to the court.
To the court? Yes.
Mr. Kringelein, I must talk with you before the police come.
Miss Flaemm is in your room?
Yes.
She's in your room.
No one will know that I was with her.
You were with her.
They will not interrogate you.
They will not ask you any questions. You cannot give no testimony.
Neither can she say anything.
But what you are proposing is falsification of the evidence.
My existence is hanging by a thread.
A scandal with that woman would mean ruin for me.
But you've just killed a man!
That makes no difference! I beg your pardon.
It makes all the difference in the world.
We're going to call the police.
No! Please, Mr. Kringelein.
I will give you money, anything. You can go away.
Please.
I have enough money.
Mr. Kringelein, please help me.
My life is in your hands.
Your life.
What about my life, when you had it in your hands?
But I can send you back to Friedersdorf. I can give you a very good position in Friedersdorf.
Many, many thanks, Mr. Industrial Magnate Preysing...
but I am never going back to Friedersdorf.
Don't, please.
Worry about yourself. Don't worry about me. No, Mr. Kringelein, please don't call...
Hello! There's been a murder here.
I don't understand you.
Murder?
They're drinking.
What? Yes.
What is it? Is this a joke?
Hello. Hurry up. Someone in 166 says there's been a murder.
166? Preysing?
I'll attend to it.
What time is it, Suzette?
It's 3:00 in the morning, Madame.
Tired, Suzette?
Is Madame not tired?
No, Suzette.
Madame has changed her dress again.
Yes, Suzette.
The music has stopped.
How quiet it is tonight.
It was never so quiet in the Grand Hotel.
Those flowers make me think of funerals.
Don't they you, Suzette?
It's just nerves, Madame, nerves.
Suzette, we're going to take a holiday soon.
Six weeks in Tremezzo.
I'm going to live like a real woman... perfectly simple, perfectly quiet, perfectly happy.
Yes, Madame.
We'll have a guest.
Certainly, Madame.
But Madame must sleep now.
The train will soon go.
I suppose so.
Call Baron von Geigern's room, please.
Keep ringing.
He must be asleep.
I'm longing for you.
I haven't been asleep.
I kept thinking that you might come to me.
But he must answer.
Ring!
Why don't you answer the phone, please? Yes.
Yes.
Ring.
Where are you?
Thirty-four!
Thirty-six. Thirty-eight.
Forty.
Forty-two.
Let's go to work, boys.
Forty-four.
Forty-four, forty-six pounds.
Forty-eight.
Are these things necessary?
I'm afraid so, Mr. Preysing.
All right.
We've taken care of all that, Mr. Preysing.
The night porter's gone. You're late.
I was at the clinic the whole night.
My wife, poor girl.
The child hasn't come yet?
But I mustn't let it interfere with my duty.
You won't forget that? - No, sir. - I'm going now.
Yes, Doctor.
What's this?
A killing in 166.
Killing? Who? The big manufacturer Preysing killed Baron von Geigern.
Good heavens!
What for?
I don't know.
That's terrible!
He was a nice fellow.
They say he was a thief.
I don't believe it. He was a real gentleman.
I know people.
I'm so tired I can't hardly see out of my eyes.
No sleep for two nights, here all day, and now this killing at the hotel.
Halt!
Front!
Good morning.
Good morning.
Show your hands.
Over.
Change those gloves. - Yes, sir.
Down.
Dismissed.
Too bad about the Baron.
You always felt better when he came along. - Always friendly, such an agreeable fellow. - I'll tell you a funny thing about...
Be quiet.
Good morning, madam.
Where are you taking that dog?
Baron von Geigern.
Give it to me.
Better take charge of this dog. It belonged to the Baron.
Yes, sir.
They have taken him away? - Yes.
Wasn't it terrible?
Madame must not know. You understand?
Madame must not know!
All right, I can tell it to the maids, but I can't answer for downstairs.
Are you all right, Miss Flaemmchen?
I was just thinking about the Baron.
Lying there, with his eyes so open.
You loved the Baron, didn't you?
So did I.
He was friendly to me as no man ever was.
What if he was a burglar?
They don't kill a man for that.
He was desperate.
He tried to raise money all day.
And he laughed, poor devil.
And a man like Preysing has to kill him.
You know, I didn't like Preysing right off.
Why did you have anything to do with him?
Money.
Money.
You don't understand that, do you?
Yes, I do.
I could take care of you, Miss Flaemmchen, if you'd let me.
I have enough money.
There's 10,200 marks in this pocketbook... and there's 3,400 that I won last night.
That would last a long time. I could win some more.
We could travel.
Travel?
Yes, to Paris.
I've always wanted to go to Paris.
Anywhere you like. Here. I'll give you this money I won last night. 3,400...
and then later you can have some more.
Later?
Yes, when I....
I'm ill, Flaemmchen.
I won't live long.
Will you stay with me?
That's nonsense!
We'll find a great doctor. He'll cure you. - They can cure anything these days.
You think so?
Of course. You'll see.
Here.
Do you think you'd have as good a time with me... as you did with Preysing?
Why, of course.
Really?
You like me better than you did him?
You're a good man, Mr. Kringelein. A very good man.
You know, I never thought anything so beautiful could come to me.
We'll catch the first train to Paris.
Order two tickets now. Come on.
I can't.
Hello, porter?
Yes, please.
I'd like two tickets to Paris. Yes.
What time does the next train leave?
Pimenov.
He'll be on the train.
But how do you know?
Baron von Geigern has left?
How long ago?
The Baron left about half an hour ago.
Gru, come, come.
We'll lose the train.
Come along.
Here you are, sir.
I'm sorry.
Mme. Grusinskaya's car.
Come along, the train will be going.
What is it, Gru?
Please come, madam, please.
I'll ask myself.
What is the use of asking?
He'll be on the train. He'll be there.
Have you seen Baron von Geigern?
The Baron is not here, madam.
Has he gone? - Yes, madam.
We haven't any time to waste.
He'll be on the train.
We have a rehearsal in Vienna tomorrow.
The sun.
It'll be sunny in Tremezzo.
We'll have a guest, Suzette.
Yes?
Grand Hotel!
The Grand Hotel, sweetheart.
This way, precious.
Take the car to the garage. Take the bags in, please.
Come, darling.
Good morning.
Will you kindly register? - Certainly.
Mr. and Mrs. Hoffman. - Head porter's desk.
Mr. Senf?
Just a moment.
Hospital.
Hello.
Yes, head porter.
Yes.
What?
Yes. - What's the matter?
The child has come.
It's a boy.
And your wife?
My wife is well.
Hello. Hospital? I'll be with you on lunch hour.
These rooms are not taken. 176, 170, 168, 166.
Is Your Excellency leaving?
A cab, please.
A cab for His Excellency. - My bill, and the lady's, too.
Have you got your tickets?
My tickets. - Tickets for Mr. Kringelein.
Your forwarding address?
The Grand Hotel, in Paris.
How do you know there will be one?
There's a Grand Hotel everywhere in the world.
Goodbye, Mr. Kringelein.
Pain's gone already?
Pain. I have none, Doctor.
Goodbye.
My luggage.
I beg your pardon. Where's the money?
Hurry. We'll miss that train.
Got your bags now? Come along.
Here you are.
Goodbye, Your Excellency.
Goodbye!
Your hat, sir.
Please be careful of that.
Friedrichstrasse Station.
Grand Hotel. Always the same.
People come, people go.
Nothing ever happens.
The Testament of Dr. Mabuse premiered on April 21, 1933, in Budapest.
Originally 124 minutes long, the film had been banned in Germany.
It wasn't until August 24, 1951, that the movie was first shown in Germany in a shortened 111-minute version.
The original negative of that version survived at the German Film Institute (DIF) but was severely damaged.
Therefore, a 1951 duplicate positive from the collection of the German Film Institute (DIF) sewed as a basis for the restoration.
Whenever possible, missing scenes from the Federal Film Archive and the Munich Film Museum were inserted.
In its present form, the film runs 121 minutes.
The film was restored by the German Film Institute (DIF) in collaboration with the Federal Film Archive, the Munich Film Museum,
KirchMedia and ZDF/ARTE.

You know that one, Muller?
That's from Die Walk/lire.
Those are the girls who carry dead police inspectors directly up to heaven from the Alexanderplatz with a "Hey ho."
On horseback.
Horseback?
Certainly. Expenses don't allow for a car.
Well, Inspector, when it comes to corpses, the state sometimes has... a fit of generosity.
That's what you think.
Believe it or not, Müller, tonight will be the first time
I make it to the theater in time for the first act.
Knock on wood, Inspector.
There. What did I tell you?
Tell 'em I'm dead.
Police headquarters. Inspector Lohmann's office.
Inspector.
Inspector.
What is it?
Hofmeister would like to speak with you, Inspector.
What?
Our former colleague who got into trouble with foreign currency?
That scoundrel?
Tell him his call is the most shameless affront
I've ever experienced!
And tell him to go to hell!
I'm sorry, but Inspector Lohmann has already left and he says you -
And he says you can go to hell!
God help me!
Let me tell you something, Müller.
I once had high hopes for that fellow Hofmeister.
I gave him his first chance.
And what does the scoundrel do?
He takes a bribe from a black-market currency trader.
Phooey!
The man I would have staked my life for disgraces me by getting fired from the service
like a bad egg.
Police headquarters. Inspector Lohmann's office.
He has to hear me out, for God's sake!
Tell him it's a matter of life and death.
Inspector, I think you really ought to -
Of course I'll miss the first act again!
I want to redeem myself in his eyes!
I finally figured out their scheme.
It's a monstrous business!
They've nearly done me in three times!
I hardly dare cross the street!
Lohmann speaking. What is it?
Inspector?
Thank you.
Cut out the nonsense and tell me what's wrong.
Yes, Inspector.
I've finally discovered -
Just a moment, please.
Just in case, Inspector, please have a record made of my report.
Headphones. Take this down.
I was actually tracing counterfeit money.
I wanted to redeem myself in your eyes, Inspector.
For four days - 96 hours -
I lay up there at the air vent, and now I know who's behind it all.
But you'll probably think I'm crazy.
Who is it?
I swear I'm telling the truth.
I know who's behind it all!
I heard his name with my own ears!
And now they know I know the name.
My God!
The lights have gone out!
Lohmann, help me, for God's sake!
Can you trace that call?
For God's sake!
Hofmeister!
What street?
Number 23?
Thanks.
Gloria
Lovely are the maidens in Batavia
Dear God.
He must have gone out of his mind from terror.
A pathological condition that is not as rare as one might suspect.
Exposure to catastrophes such as explosions, earthquakes and railway accidents - in short, exposure to fright and horror often triggers insanity.
Perhaps the most interesting case of such pathological conditions is the case of Dr. Mabuse.
Here he goes again.
I shall briefly recount the history of this case.
The patient lived a decidedly double life.
He was a renowned doctor with a large private practice.
Aided by an almost superhuman logic, he used his profound knowledge of hypnosis to commit crimes of a magnitude previously deemed impossible.
For months the police sought the mastermind behind those crimes, the man behind the curtain.
At last they discovered his whereabouts.
But Mabuse decided not to flee but rather to mount armed resistance, and he barricaded himself in his house with four loyal henchmen.
He refused demands to surrender to state authorities, saying,
I am the state!"
A barrage of bullets forced the police to retreat.
Finally, soldiers stormed the house with hand grenades.
Two of the defenders were killed. Two were captured.
Mabuse, however, had disappeared.
One prisoner revealed his hiding place:
a counterfeiting lab from which he planned to launch a massive attack on the German currency system.
The police force their way in to seize him only to find he had gone hopelessly insane.
Judging by his incoherent remarks, he had seen, during the previous night, the ghosts of all those he had slain.
Apparently it was the horror of that experience that overpowered this phenomenal mind, which for so long had straddled the fine line between genius and madness, and literally deranged it.
Mabuse was committed to an insane asylum and to this day has not spoken a word to anyone.
Silent and motionless, he remains in the position you see here.
The patient withdrew into his own ego, depriving us of any glimpse into his inner life.
But suddenly the clinical profile changed.
We observed that Mabuse's hand continuously made writing motions in the air, on the wall and on the bedspread.
We gave him pencil and paper.
At first, he covered the paper with senseless scribbling.
Two years ago, however, certain words began to appear on the paper.
Then, sentences began to form, still meaningless and confused.
Gradually they grew more coherent and logical, and at last we began to get glimpses into the extraordinary phenomenon that was his mind.
His thoughts still move in the same criminal channels as before.
Whatever Mabuse writes is based upon incontrovertible logic and serves as a perfect guide for the commission of crimes worked out to the minutest detail.
No. Nothing can happen to us if we follow the doctor's methods.
Oh, yeah?
What do you mean, "oh, yeah"?
The first attacks on the snitch failed.
So what?
Tough luck.
So we called in Division 2-B to handle the matter.
If they succeed, fine.
And if they don't - if it looks like that snitch might rat on us - one single phone call and this whole place gets blown sky-high.
Stop scratching, Fritzi.
It won't come to that.
Before that guy can open his mouth, he'll be done for.
I'd feel better if they didn't resort to murder.
What do you mean, murder?
A guy can have something fall on his head, can't he?
A nice, clean little accident.
I don't care how you make it look.
I just don't want anything to do with murder.
Scared?
Can't bear the sight of blood?
Let me tell you something, though it's really none of your damn business.
I've killed two people.
I know what it means to kill.
And that's precisely why
I want nothing to do with murder.
Leave him alone, Fritzi. What do you know about Kent?
The phone!
Yeah?
It's been taken care of?
Really?
Just 20 minutes later?
Lohmann himself?
Continue writing.
Hofmeister himself has disappeared.
The rug has been moved toward the window.
He was on the phone when the lights went out.
Where's the light switch?
Here by the door.
So it came from over there, the unknown horror, the thing that caused his mind to snap.
And he backed away from it step by step, right up to the window.
I wonder if he -
No, he couldn't get out this way.
Certainly not downward.
Well, I'll be damned!
Actual letters scratched into the glass with a ring.
So he was trying to tell me something.
Is that a W?
No.
Could it be a name?
It may take us a while to figure that one out.
Hey, Kruger.
Yes, Inspector.
Take this pane of glass to my office at headquarters.
And see that you don't break it, or I'll bite your head off.
That's odd. I wonder what's behind that.
Thirty pages today, Professor.
Thank you.
Keep a careful eye on him tonight. I don't like his pulse.
In any case, give him a shot later so he can get some rest.
Yes, Professor.
Their famous chocolate shake?
And a double mocha for you, sir?
With hot cream. - As usual. Very well.
And now tell me, Tom.
Why did you ask to see me so urgently today?
Don't you know what today is, Lilli?
Today?
Too bad.
Won't you tell me?
Certainly.
A chocolate shake and a double mocha with hot cream.
Well, Tom?
You ask what day this is?
Exactly one year ago today, at the employment office -
No smoking, gentlemen.
Smoking is prohibited.
Good heavens, my friend, are you back again?
I've told you a hundred times there's no point in coming every day.
When we have work for you, we'll certainly notify you.
I've been waiting for three months!
Be reasonable.
Reasonable?
What does reasonable mean when a man is going under?
I want to work!
But they keep pushing me closer to the edge!
It's enough to drive a man to crime!
He's forced to become a criminal!
He marches in here and causes a riot!
Don't get so worked up. We have others to attend to.
Come now.
Leave him alone.
He's sick.
Come now.
Don't touch me! I'll go on my own!
You'll never see me again here!
Next, please.
You've seen the last of me!
Just a moment, please.
I can't bear to see you leave like this.
Here are 20 marks.
It's all I have right now, but I'd like you to have it.
It may help you out.
I don't want charity.
I want work, not a handout.
It's not a handout.
It's just a loan.
I'm sure you'll be able to pay me back.
Please.
Yes.
And six months later, you found work and promptly paid back my 20 marks.
Tell me, Lilli... have you ever been in love?
It's high time I was going.
Here comes my bus.
Please stay.
I can't. I've got to run.
Good-bye, Tom. Call me.
Good-bye.
Good-bye.
If you'll be seated, Doctor, the professor is due back any moment.
Thanks, Winkler. I'm sure I'll find what I need.
Ah, I see it's on his desk.
Oops. Oh, dear!
What order does all this go in?
This junk isn't even numbered.
What is this anyway?
NOTES BY DR. MABUSE SEPTEMBER 1ST
How does this go together now?
No, the other way around.
Then this page.
What's the next part? "Jewel-"
No.
Jewel ry store."
Jewelry store... specializing in high-quality..."
What?
The least conspicuous and therefore most effective precaution to prevent interruption by police, pedestrians and clients is to pull the shades and hang a sign on the door:
'Closed from 10:00 to 2:00 for inventory."
Well, I'll be!
The criminals then lowered the shades and hung a sign outside the door,
'Closed from 10:00 to 2:00 for inventory."
If that isn't something!
That's incredible!
Immobilize the staff by using gas in bulbs of thin glass, which will burst almost inaudibly when tossed."
Gas! Amazing!
Identical, almost to the word!
The criminals appear to have tossed bulbs of thin glass filled with gas."
Bulbs of thin glass filled with gas."
If that isn't Odd!
It's as if they were following a blueprint!
What are you doing there?
Baum.
This is the most incredible thing you could imagine.
Look here. What is this?
Where did you get these papers?
Never mind that!
You know what they are?
Yes, of course.
Now read this.
Ingenious jewelry heist..."
That's right. Read it.
Jewelry stolen valued at 250,000 marks.
Gas was used on the employees."
Yes, just as if they were following your Dr. Mabuse's instructions.
A curious coincidence.
Now wait just a minute.
You call that a coincidence?
What else?
Baum, old man, coincidences like that just don't happen.
There's some connection in all this or I'll eat my hat.
Say, I've got a crazy idea.
Could this Mabuse fellow be faking it?
Maybe the guy isn't insane after all.
Tell me, do you think that, after treating a patient for years,
I can't judge whether he's really sick or just pretending?
I didn't mean it like that.
But there must be something behind all this.
You know what a genius this fellow was.
It's just possible that his dead brain has come back to life.
Couldn't Mabuse be writing these things as a sort of blueprint for a gang of accomplices?
You've always had a wild imagination.
Just hear me out.
What if Mabuse, with his incredible hypnotic powers, engaged in some kind of telepathic hypnosis from his cell?
Nonsense!
Nonsense?
Say what you like, but there's something weird going on!
Who else besides you knows about Mabuse's notes?
You sound just like a policeman.
I think the police should be informed of this strange coincidence.
The police?
Of course!
Well, perhaps -
Of course you're right.
The police would want to know of this.
Of course!
I'll go to them at once.
If I can, I'll call you from the station.
Good-bye.
Please drive carefully, Doctor. It's been raining.
Thank you, Winkler.
Good-bye.
I do not wish to be disturbed.

INGENIOUS JEWELRY HEIST

One can do a lot with that.
Can? Could!
But what will be done with it?
What's gonna happen with that quarter million?
Careful.
I ask you -
Will you stay down?
What becomes of it, I ask you?
We buy cocaine with it, morphine, heroin, opium, whatever you call all that crap.
And instead of making a killing off the dope and fleecing the types who are crazy for the stuff, they practically give it away.
What good does it do the boss to pump the world full of dope and not make any money off it?
These things won't stay down. What does it get him?
I follow his instructions and drive ten people nearly crazy with threats and blackmail.
And when they're ready to pay any sum we ask, then I'm told to back off and forget about the money.
Only result is they're driven crazy from fear of a scandal.
Is that any business of yours, old boy?
Did you ever fail to get your pay on time?
That's not what I'm saying.
Okay, then.
You handle the blackmail, and I see to your alibi.
We get our paychecks like clockwork, so what are you growling about?
I'm not growling.
I just don't get it.
If a woman throws herself out the window, or a fellow blows his brains out, like that bank director, blackmail letters aren't of much use.
150 grand tossed in the gutter. ls there any sense in that?
Or take the new instructions about the explosives, and stealing poison from drugstores - that's scary business.
As it's meant to be, my dear fellow.
But why, in the devil's name?
I think you ask too many questions.
The boss doesn't like that.
What?
You know him?
No more than you do, or anyone else in our gang.
And I'm not the least bit curious.
I learned my lesson from your predecessor.
He just had to find out what the man looked like, the man behind the curtain, the boss.
So one day, without having been summoned, he snuck into the famous room with the curtain.
And that's where we found him.
Or rather... what was left of him.
Cut it out, man. You're spoiling my appetite.
Let me give you a tip.
Let the boss worry about this stuff.
We're well paid. In fact, very well paid.
If something goes wrong, we'll have cast-iron alibis or a top-notch lawyer.
The boss thinks of everything and takes care of everything and demands not a penny for himself of all the loot.
Not a penny.
See? That's just it. Why?
Why doesn't he take a single penny for himself?
I can't understand that, and that's what's got me jumpy.
Lots of others in our gang probably feel the same and would like to be done with the whole thing but just don't know how.
Dearest Lilli, you dashed off so quickly this afternoon that I had no chance to say what I wanted to tell you.
TONIGHT AT 1100 A.M.
DR. MABUSE
You say you searched the furthest precincts and found no trace of Hofmeister?
His description was sent to all officers?
Inspector Lohmann asks if you had the hospitals searched.
A special squad did that, and Hofmeister hasn't been admitted anywhere?
Damn it!
You'll call back?
Wait a minute.
Get a picture of Hofmeister from the files.
We may need to have posters printed up.
Now, then, what is your assessment of the murder in the automobile?
So far, all I know is that the killer used a 7.65-mm Dreyse pistol, from 1906, production of which ended in 1916.
This weapon was fired from a distance of not more than 25 feet.
No empty shells were found in the street nor on the sidewalk, and the bullet's trajectory indicates the shot was not fired from a window but rather from a point almost level with the victim's head.
We may therefore conclude the shot was fired from another vehicle.
Another vehicle?
That would be very interesting indeed.
That opens up a whole new perspective.
Inspector Lohmann's office.
Not bad.
Excuse me, Inspector. It's Habermann.
This is about the Kramm homicide.
Inspector, we've traced the murder victim's actions up until 6:10 on the evening of the murder.
Where he was from then until the time of death we have not yet been able to establish.
But that's what we need to find out.
See that you find out where he was those last two hours.
Very well.
Müller, arrange to have - No, wait.
Where's the text for the Kramm homicide poster?
Here it is.
All information will be kept confidential" -
Put another line in here:
Especially concerning the hours from 6:00 to 8:00 p.m."
Have those changes made.
And - No, never mind. I'll do it myself.
Photo department.
Weber, the old man wants to talk to you.
Trouble?
I don't know.
Weber here.
I'm just doing it now.
Enlargements, naturally.
Trace the scratches and see if you can't link them together into a word or name or something.
I'm sure Hofmeister intended to -
Inspector, they found Hofmeister!
Where?
The police station at Schöneberger Ufer.
A police patrol found him.
At first they thought he was just another drunk because he kept babbling to himself incessantly.
But then they heard him call your name.
Inspector Lohmann.
Why won't you listen to me, for God's sake?
Inspector, you must listen to me.
It's a matter of life and death.
Inspector Lohmann, please listen, for the love of God!
Gloria
Gloria
Lovely are the maidens in Batavia
Between 17 and 18
My God!
You see?
The moment he thinks he's being watched, he starts singing.
When he thinks he's alone, he calls your name.
I'll leave you alone now.
Hofmeister, don't you recognize me?
Goddamn it!
Hofmeister, it's me, Lohmann.
Your old friend Lohmann.
My God!
Inspector?
Inspector Lohmann?
Why don't you come to the phone?
For God's sake, come to the phone, Inspector Lohmann.
Come to the phone!
Hello. This is Lohmann.
Detective Inspector Lohmann.
Who is it, please?
Inspector?
Is that you, Hofmeister?
This is Lohmann.
Lovely are the maidens
Hopeless.
We'll have no other choice but to commit the poor devil to an institution.
Listen to me, for God's sake!
Why don't you come to the phone, Inspector?
Poor devil, eh?
Heaven help me if I ever get my hands on the scoundrel responsible for that fellow's condition!
All of a sudden he stopped writing and just sat there like a living corpse.
Then he suddenly got an expression in his eyes, those eyes that leave you practically paralyzed!
The eyes of a man who -
If he were in his right mind,
I believe he could compel people to do his will right from his cell.
The professor must come.
The professor is working and doesn't wish to be disturbed.
Winkler, this is Mabuse!
Not so loud!
The professor will fire me on the spot.
I do not wish to be disturbed.
With great disconcertment I have found out that in the Hofmeister matter, surveillance at the print shop failed in the most irresponsible way.
Don 'I interrupt.
I didn't' ask for your opinion.
The Hofmeister affair would have turned into a catastrophe of the first order if not for the excellent work of Division 2-B.
HI come back to that later.
Even so, in the future, all security measures protecting our organization will be made much more stringent.
Anyone constituting a menace to our organization is to be eliminated without exception.
Kent, it has come to my ears that you - perhaps due to something in your past - that you do not approve of certain of my organization's measures.
I'm warning you, Kent - and I never give more than one warning -
in the near future you will have to prove that you are absolutely committed to our organization, and that you know what you are being paid for.
MURDER - 2,000 MARKS REWARD
Murder.
No!
It's really none of my business, but I don't think you're taking the doctor's warning seriously enough.
Oh, yes, I am.
Division 2-B.
No one in the organization gets out of it alive.
It's hopeless.
There's no turning back.
I must say farewell forever, and I can't even tell you why.
But there's no other way for me to behave decently towards you.
You will never know what you've meant in my botched life.
It is very difficult to say good-bye to you, Lilli."
Forget me - though I shall never forget you!"
It spells Mabuse.
What spells Mabuse?
Those scratches on the windowpane, Inspector.
It took me forever to discover he was writing as if in a mirror.
Using his left hand, and behind his back.
If you flip it over, see there?
Quite clear.
Wasn't he that -
That doctor back during the economic crisis?
Quite right. Inspector.
I've got him. 1920 - 1921.
Dr. Mabuse "The Gambler."
Come on, let me see that.
Let's see what business he has being on that windowpane.
When Lohmann has untied all the knots, then you may sweep up as much as you like.
But until then, he'll go wild as an ape if you touch anything, and he bites.
I'd like to see him try.
Müller.
The old man's coming.
Müller, come here.
Ca" up 69-19-902.
That's the mental hospital run by Professor Baum where they committed a certain Dr. Mabuse.
I'd like to know if he's still there.
When?
Thank you.
Dr. Mabuse died this morning.
This morning?
Today of all days.
That is quite peculiar.
TONIGHT AT 12100
DR. MABUSE
So, you too?
What do you mean, me too?
Something big is on for tonight, it seems.
We've been called in, as have Divisions 5 and 9... as well as Section 2-B.
Good Lord.
It's no use, Kent.
The doctor is more powerful than you.
Is your curiosity satisfied now,
Inspector?
And this corpse is clearly identified as Mabuse?
There's no doubt of that?
Unfortunately not, Inspector.
Unfortunately it is only too certain that this dead man here is Dr. Mabuse.
Or was.
Alas.
This assessment of the deceased -
ls smoking permitted here?
Seems to me to be slightly, let's say -
Do you smoke?
No, thanks.
Let's say slightly exaggerated.
In the case of Dr. Mabuse, we're not dealing with a human being of value but with an evil criminal who only escaped the gallows by entering an insane asylum.
One less insane criminal in the world.
Silence!
You have no idea.
No one has any idea what kind of phenomenal, superhuman mind has come to an end with Dr. Mabuse's death.
This mind would have laid waste to our whole rotten world, which is long overdue for destruction.
This godless world, devoid of justice and compassion, consisting only of selfishness, cruelty and hatred.
This mind would have destroyed mankind, which itself knows only destruction and extermination and which could only have been saved in its final hour through terror and horror.
Mabuse the criminal?
Mabuse the genius!
His intellectual legacy would have turned your world, with its police protection, on its head!
His legacy?
You speak of Mabuse's legacy?
No. Yes.
Of course, not a testament in the accepted sense of the word.
Just some of his notes, of interest only to physicians and men of science.
I'm afraid, Professor, that you underestimate the number of subjects in which I take an interest.
Take, for example, a case which concerns me intimately.
Wasn't a young man admitted to your institution earlier today by the name of Hofmeister?
May I see that man?
I'm terribly sorry, Inspector.
That man seems to be suffering the effects of some frightful experience that he relives each time someone approaches him.
Then he begins singing like a frightened child sings in the dark.
I must therefore request, for the good of the patient, that you refrain from seeing him now.
What is it?
Forgive me, Professor. We only wanted to -
They're waiting for you in anatomy class.
Yes, of course.
Well, I see the doctor's cell is already occupied again.
Yes, the new one who arrived last night.
The professor ordered that he be isolated.
The doctor's cell just became vacant, so we put him in it.
It's strange when you come to think of it.
For 10 years I've cared for the doctor, and now he lies down there in the morgue.
Or what's left of him.
TONIGHT AT 12100
DR. MABUSE
The doctor.
Division 5 to the boss.
NOTES BY DR. MABUSE
FEBRUARY 15TH TO MARCH 31ST
The Empire of Crime."
The empire of crime.
Humanity's soul must be shaken to its very depths, frightened by unfathomable and seemingly senseless crimes.
Crimes that benefit no one, whose only objective is to inspire fear and terror."
Because the ultimate purpose of crime is to establish the endless empire of crime.
A state of complete insecurity and anarchy, founded upon the tainted ideals of a world doomed to annihilation.
When humanity, subjugated by the terror of crime, has been driven insane by fear and horror,
and when chaos has become supreme law, then the time will have come for the empire of crime.
ATTACKS UPON RAILROAD LINES,
GAS STORAGE TANKS, CHEMICAL FACTORIES
You have the special maps for the northern area?
Yes, sir.
The fire in the chemical factory in quadrants E-9 and K-14 -
Repeat that.
Quadrants E-9 and K-14."
They are to be concentrated so as to spread the blaze mainly to the storerooms and depots.
Is that clear?
Yes, sir.
By the time the fire crews arrive, the flames must be impossible to subdue.
Division 3 and Dr. Hauser to the boss.
ACTIONS AGAINST BANKS AND CURRENCY
Division 3? - Yes.
And Dr. Hauser.
Report.
Per my orders, the letters incriminating the signatory of the Overseas Bank were not returned to him, even when very large sums were offered, until he agreed to comply completely with our demands.
We are now in possession of duplicate keys to every one of the bank's vaults, as well as combinations to all the safes and plans for all alarm systems.
Only after successful completion of our mission will the letters be returned.
Good.
Turn the material over to Division 3 and wait downstairs. H!
need you later. - Yes, sir.
Division 3, you are to bundle the completed counterfeit bills this morning and affix the stamps of the Overseas Bank.
Per the instructions you have just received, at exactly 11:00 tomorrow night you will break into the bank and replace the bills now deposited in the bank with the counterfeit bills so that the bank itself will distribute the counterfeit money.
The bank guards are to be killed.
Killed!
There mustn't be the slightest clue to suggest the safes were opened.
Once everything has been executed according to plan, the bank's alarms must be set off to simulate a burglary interrupted in progress.
Do you understand? - Yes, sir.
Division 3 is no longer needed.
I LOVE YOU!
Good evening, Tom.
I was here in the afternoon, too, but you weren't home.
Nor were you here earlier this evening.
So I waited, Tom, a terribly long time.
Won't you at least offer me a seat in return, Tom?
What a lovely place you have here.
I like rooms that have such wide, tall windows.
Lovely.
Is this true?
Yes, Tom.
But I wrote to you!
And I gave you my answer, Tom.
But you don't even know who I am, Lilli.
My dear Tom, isn't that entirely beside the point?
Beside the point?
Entirely beside the point!
We'll see right now whether it's beside the point!
There you have it, in black and white - just who I am.
Official confirmation with the seal and signature of the prison director and everything that goes with it.
Prison.
Yes, prison!
Four and a half years in prison!
The last six months commuted for good behavior.
There.
Why should I care, Tom?
I love you.
You don't know why I was in prison.
I killed two people.
One was my girlfriend, and the other was the man I'd thought was my best friend.
Why should I care, Tom?
I love you.
Then I'm forced to tell you the rest, Lilli.
L---
I lied to you, Lilli!
I told you I'd found a position, didn't I?
Well, I certainly did.
Do you know where?
In a counterfeiting lab.
That's one place that can use an engineer who's an ex-con.
If I had only known what I know now.
Along with destruction of the crops, water supplies must be poisoned.
Epidemics of every kind must break down any resistance on the pad of the people.
A warning to unreliable elements will not be issued again.
The slightest sign of treachery will be punished immediately by death.
You see, Lilli?
This time you don't say,
Why should I care, Tom? I love you."
Look, Tom.
When I received your letter, did you really think me so dense that I wouldn't sense the despair in your heart?
I thought to myself,
What he needs is to regain his faith in himself, to believe that everything can turn out well again."
And I thought to myself,
Maybe you can restore his faith in himself if you tell him how much you care for him
and that you will stand by him for better or for worse."
And so I came to you.
Tell me, have you taken it upon yourself to rob me of my last shred of sanity?
Yes, Tom.
You! You!
You have to report that he's failed to show up.
Let's wait.
Finished.
I guess I have no other choice.
Section 2-B?
Yes.
This is Division 3.
I must report that Kent didn't show up.
Believe me, Tom, your life is just beginning.
A brand-new life, clean, spotless and good.
It's true, Tom!
We'll put it all behind us and make a fresh start.
And you know who'll help us?
Help us?
Yes, Tom. The man who once -
When he had to arrest you, he was so decent and compassionate towards you.
Lohmann?
Inspector.
What is it?
Voberg is here.
He claims to have some important news.
Give me a cigar and raise the shades. Then show him in.
Morning, Inspector.
What is it?
Well, Inspector, it's like this.
Scholz and I think we've stumbled across something -
Lower those shades.
Clumsy fool.
We stumbled across something that might lead us to the jewelry robbers.
Is that so?
We saw a girl running around with a big pearl necklace.
She could tell me anything at all, that she bought the thing at Woolworth's for 25 pfennigs.
But Scholz knows about these things, and he swears that necklace is genuine.
Well, is it?
So far all we know is that she's the sweetheart of a scoundrel who's an expert on anything having to do with jewelry robberies.
Where are the others?
They had a few details to take care of.
Come along, quietly.
Come along, Kent.
Come on, let's go!
Off you go, then, but remember:
Be careful.
You're dealing with a dangerous international crook.
Understand?
Yes, Inspector.
All right then. Good luck.
Good day, Chief.
Kent!
You were ordered to prepare the strike against the Overseas Bank.
You failed to carry out your orders.
Failure to obey is tantamount to treason.
The penalty for both offenses is death.
Let the woman go free.
Do with me what you like, but let her go free.
You and that woman will never leave this room alive.
You monster!
Tom, for God's sake!
Stay back!
Good God!
You will never leave this room alive.
You have three hours left to live.
What's that?
Tom, what's that?
What's that, Tom?
Whatever it is, Lilli, we must find it and put an end to it.
You'll be taking over Kent's job, by the way.
He won't be able to do it anymore.
What do you mean?
He's otherwise engaged.
Who could that be?
How do I know?
Maybe it's the mailman.
Anni!
Wanna go and see who that is?
Hold on.
Who is it?
The gas man. I'd like to inspect the meter.
Afternoon, miss.
You want to look at the meter?
Come back some other time. I've got company right now.
How dare you! - Police.
Open up.
Look out! Police!
Don't shoot!
Shut up, you idiot!
Get out!
Quick, out the back door!
We don't have one!
You idiots get an apartment with only one exit?
What about the window?
From the fourth floor?
There must be some way out!
Shall I put in an elevator for you guys?
Now we're really done for!
That guy will call all his cop friends.
And on a Sunday, too.
What're you crying about?
It's your own damn fault for firing at him!
Leave me alone, you hear?
Stop giving me a hard time!
Listen, try to knock a hole through the ceiling.
Maybe we can escape to the roof.
I'll try to hit the guy and keep him back from the door!
Stay back.
Notify the Special Tactics Squad and get hold of-
Damned scoundrel!
Who should I get hold of?
Homicide. Inspector Lohmann.
It's no use. We'll never get out this way.
The window, Tom. We could try to break through that.
Cement.
But the brick, maybe.
Damn it!
Hey!
How far are you in there?
I can't hold this door forever. Lohmann and his whole gang are here.
Lohmann?
That's it!
I'm out!
Get yourself killed, all of you!
What do you mean by that?
What do I mean?
I'll tell you what I mean!
Watch the door!
Out of the way.
Hardy, be sensible. It's no use.
We won't get anywhere on the roof.
Let me talk to them.
Let me tell you something.
Anyone who gets near that door, inside or out, is gonna get it, understand?
Go keep an eye on them!
Move it!
Almost.
Now.
Let's see now.
What's the matter, Tom?
It's no use, Lilli.
Behind those bricks is a steel plate.
Dear God!
Careful!
A bullet can cripple you for life!
Is he dead?
Karetzky.
Goddamn this mess!
Anni, get some towels.
Come on, quick!
It's no use. Better keep an eye on the door.
Why didn't you let me negotiate?
You and your stupid shooting!
Bredow, shoot anyone who comes near the door!
Do you hear?
You bet I will!
I've had enough of this business.
I've got you now.
Open up!
It's Lohmann!
What's the matter?
Lohmann's outside.
I forbid you to go!
Who are you to forbid anything?
I won't land in jail 'cause of you!
Think I'll let you cowardly swine send me to the slaughter?
Be sensible.
It's no use.
We've got hand grenades.
I'll give you one last chance.
If you're reasonable, we'll be reasonable too.
That's the way.
Attaboy. Daddy's proud of you.
Now, open the door and put your hands up.
How many of you are there?
Five, Inspector.
One, two, three.
Diamond Anna!
See you don't catch a cold, my dear.
Four.
Where's the fifth?
Damn it!
Don't try anything!
A Dreyse pistol.
What do you know?
A Dreyse pistol, no less.
Made in 1906, 7.65-mm.
Apparently the former owner - a friend of yours -
No. - No?
That's funny.
It says here that the two of you were close friends.
It's signed by Karetzky, Diamond Anna, and her sweetheart.
One shouldn't forsake a friend who's died.
I'm not forsaking him.
That's more like it.
So your old buddy held on to this gun because he was used to it.
Actually, haven't these things been out of style for a long time?
I'm no gun expert.
That's right.
You're more of an expert on automobiles.
What make of car did Dr. Kramm drive?
A "Hanomag" or a DKW?
Who?
Dr. Kramm, the guy you two rubbed out from your car.
I don't know what you're talking about, Inspector.
Is that so? Müller.
It's no good, Lilli.
I can't find a thing.
God almighty.
There, there.
Steady, Lilli.
My dear little Lilli.
There might be another way.
It's a long shot.
What if we flood the room with water?
Water?
Yes. Where did I -
What are you looking for, Tom?
My knife.
Water lessens the force of an explosion.
There it is.
Out of the way.
It just might break through the wall for us.
What if it doesn't, Tom?
If the water rises, and we're -
Let's try it, Tom.
Here you are, Inspector.
Thank you.
So you don't know anything about Dr. Kramm's murder?
No, Inspector. The first I heard of it was right here.
Let me show you something. Come here.
Come, come.
Take a look at this still life.
You're familiar with this here.
A 7.65-mm Dreyse pistol made in 1906.
It belonged to your friend.
He shot himself with it, didn't he?
Yes.
Fine.
But do you know what's in there?
No.
Well, then, look here.
Take that magnifying glass and take a careful look at these two Easter eggs.
Well?
See any difference?
No, not the slightest.
You see, my boy, that's just it!
None of us police could detect any difference either, neither with the magnifying glass nor in the photographs.
These two bullets are so completely identical that they could only have been fired from the same gun.
Yet one was taken from the skull of the deceased Dr. Kramm, and the other was found in the skull of your dead friend Hardy.
Glass of water, my lad?
Cigarette.
So now tell me why your friend Hardy shot and killed Dr. Kramm.
I can't tell you that, Inspector. - Liar!
Kill me if you like, but I don't know what Hardy's orders were!
So you had orders?
Not me. Hardy.
From whom?
I couldn't tell you, Inspector.
I've never seen the man in my life.
Now enters the mystery man.
Come on in and pull up a chair.
Just what we needed: the man in the shadows.
So you don't know the man's name?
On my honor, Inspector, I don't know who gave Hardy those orders.
Then there's nothing we can do.
Dictate for the record what you know about the whole case.
Yes, Inspector.
Müller.
Yes, Inspector.
It was like this, Mr. Assistant Inspector.
I was just -
I was just washing my car, because everything has to be in top shape in these days of keen competition.
Suddenly the phone rings, and Hardy picks it up.
Then he came and said we were to catch up with Dr. Kramm's car at the intersection of Körnerstrasse and Grüner Winkel.
So we set out, of course, and pretty soon he showed up.
Sergeant, take this man away.
Isn't Professor Baum's insane asylum on Grüner Winkel?
Yes, Inspector.
So that's where Dr. Kramm spent his final two hours.
Look and see if we have any police record for Dr. Baum.
Baum
Bertha, Anna, Ulrich, Max.
Nothing on him?
Well, that was - Thank you.
Get Professor Baum on the phone for me.
Professor, it's police headquarters.
Inspector Lohmann wishes to speak to you.
This is Professor Baum.
This man swears you've been treating him for the last two months.
I think he's just trying to establish an alibi.
I'd like to confront him with you.
Without him knowing who you are, of course.
Could you come over right away?
Thanks a million, Professor.
If I'm on the right track now,
I'm gonna get high as a kite tonight!
That's our way out!
We're saved!
Inspector, when are you going to let me out of this monkey cage?
My dear fellow, we're glad we've got you in there.
But I've told you everything I know.
We'll see about that. Professor, please.
Well, Professor, do you know that man?
Is he the one?
No, Inspector. I've definitely never seen him before.
Just as I thought.
You there.
Then I've troubled you for nothing.
Professor.
Sorry to disturb you, Inspector, but we need your signature here.
I'll be right with you. Pardon me a moment, Professor.
Perhaps you might wait in my office.
Room 204, at the end of the hall.
Thanks.
Any of you know that man?
No, Inspector.
No.
Never seen him before.
Bredow, do you know the man you just saw with me?
No, Inspector. I don't know the gentleman.
Not the slightest doubt?
No.
MURDER - 2,000 MARKS REWARD
Sad business, isn't it?
Especially for you, since you were a close friend of the victim.
Yes, we were on excellent terms as colleagues.
The poor fellow even visited you on the day of his death.
You could have saved us a lot of work, Professor, if you'd reported that to the police.
INFORMATION OF ANY KIND
ESPECIALLY CONCERNING THE HOURS FROM 6100 TO 8100 P.M.
This request was published in every newspaper and posted on kiosks all over the city.
I never read newspapers, only medical literature.
And today's the first time I've been in town in four weeks.
Dr. Kramm came to look something up in a scientific book in my library.
He left in the best of spirits.
As for his death, it's as much a mystery to me as it is to you.
Then I'm terribly sorry to have troubled you for nothing.
Why, it's Kent!
Do you know him?
Who?
Him.
I asked you if you knew him.
Where would I know him from?
I have no idea, yet you just spoke his name.
I did?
That was you, Inspector.
Inspector, I must speak to you. It's terribly urgent.
I suppose I may leave, Inspector? My time is -
Of course. By all means, Professor.
Just a moment, Kent.
Many thanks for coming.
Don't mention it. Good-bye.
Good-bye.
Inspector, please -
Just a moment.
Go on in.
It's all right.
It's tremendously important - - Just a moment.
This is crucial: Do you know that man who just left?
No.
Are you certain?
I'm certain.
Yet I could swear he knew you.
Most certainly not. I've never seen him before.
Damn it!
What happened to you, for God's sake?
That's why we've come.
And what is the name of this "boss" you mention?
Dr. Mabuse.
Goddamn it!
Mabuse again!
That fellow is dead!
He's alive and kicking, I tell you.
I saw the cadaver myself.
Bless you.
It's true.
I'm telling you, he's not dead.
I think the two of us are living proof of that, though as for "living," that was pure luck!
Inspector, I put myself completely in your hands.
Last night...
I could have fled but I didn't, because I realized this is about more than my life or liberty.
My God, how can I convince you?
Is this proof enough for you?
TONIGHT AT 12100
DR. MABUSE
Typewritten.
That's no proof.
Someone else could have -
Someone else"?
I'm not in for anybody. No exceptions.
Yes, Professor.
All the evidence leads again and again to that insane asylum.
Müller, get the car.
I may be putting my neck on the line, but I'm going out there once more, and you're going with me, Kent.
Perhaps you're right and
Mabuse is still alive.
I'd like to speak with Professor Baum. - I'm afraid that's impossible.
The professor can see no one.
Just tel! him that Police Inspector Lohmann wishes to see him.
Gentlemen, it's really impossible.
The professor gave strict orders not to disturb him.
My good man, I must speak with him. Now go on and announce me.
But, Inspector -
Will you announce me or not?
I have strict instructions - - Fine.
Don't announce me.
But, Inspector -
I do not wish to be disturbed.
That's him!
That's his voice! - What?
That's the boss's voice.
I'd recognize it anywhere.
That's the man!
Where is the man whose voice we just heard?
Kent, come over here.
What is it?
I do not wish to be disturbed.
I clearly said I did not wish to be disturbed.
That's his voice.
Nice little contraption.
Very clever.
No wonder you failed to recognize the man's voice.
You only heard a mechanical reproduction of it.
The professor?
Baum. Of course.
But where is he hiding?
What's this?
A map of the northern part of town?
That must be the Löhr  Stegerwald chemical factory.
CHEMICAL PLANT
OCTOBER 15TH
And today's date.
Strange.
Very strange.
What's one to make of that?
There's something else here.
It's in pencil.
8:30 p.m., and today's date.
It's now 9:10.
Kent, call the chemical plant.
There won't be anyone there, but they must have guards.
And here's something else.
Notes by Dr. Mabuse"?
Isn't that interesting.
Go ahead.
Good Lord!
The chemical factory!
Fires started in this manner in a chemical factory's storerooms cannot be extinguished by firefighters.
Tanks exploding from the heat will quickly release immense quantities of poisonous gas into surrounding areas of the city."
Damn it!
They're playing cards again instead of keeping guard.
Here's your line, Inspector.
Police headquarters?
Inspector Lohmann.
Lohmann, look!
What?
In the light there!
Quiet.
Over there!
Nothing.
Damn it!
There.
Krause!
Where's my driver? Krause!
Where is that guy?
Krause!
I'll drive, Inspector.
Push that car out of the way.
I just hope this piece of junk can make it.
Faster, faster!
Come on!
CAUTION
RAILROAD CROSSING
Get out of the way!
Faster! Come on!
Now we're done for.
Get the spare.
The empire of crime...
The empire of crime...
Gloria
Lovely are the maidens in Batavia
Permit me to introduce myself.
My name is Mabuse.
Dr. Mabuse.
For heaven's sake!
Who opened that door?
Run and get help!
He'll kill him!
Police.
We're looking for -
Hofmeister!
Inspector!
That man's name is Mabuse.
Come, my boy.
There's nothing left to do here for a mere police inspector.
May I go out now, Miss Simpson?
Has it stopped snowing?
Not quite.
If it has stopped when your sister returns, perhaps she will take you out.
Oh, dear.
Suppose it never stops.
Suppose the man in charge of the snow has forgotten how to stop it.
Don't you think you had better work a while at your sampler?
No, thank you.
Oh, dear.
Hello, Sir Turtle.
You really must stop that, Your Majesty.
Stop it, I say!
Stop what?
The White Queen just knocked over the White King.
She never does look where she's going.
Alice, you know you are not supposed to play with your father's chessmen.
But I wasn't playing.
She deliberately bumped into His Majesty and knocked him off his feet.
Alice, are you sure that that is true?
Well, I saw it.
Alice.
Yes, Miss Simpson.
At any rate, Your Majesty, stop bumping into your husband.
A white rabbit!
All dressed up in a muffler and overcoat and big woolly shoes.
There.
It's gone into its nice warm rabbit hole.
It looked so funny all dressed up.
Alice, I am sure you know that there is no such thing as a rabbit dressed up in a muffler and an overcoat.
You must not say what is not true.
Well, it... It wasn't untrue exactly.
I think you had better finish your tea.
There is another egg for you to eat.
I did eat both eggs, but I put one of them all back together again.
Alice!
Yes, Miss Simpson.
The looking-glass room.
You see, Dinah, as soon as I hold you up, the little girl in the looking-glass room holds up another cat just like you.
Oh, Dinah, wouldn't you like to see what the looking-glass house is like?
You know, Dinah, there is a looking-glass house.
First, there's the room you can see through the glass.
That's just the same as our sitting room, only the things go the other way.
You'd love living there.
But, of course, I don't know whether looking-glass milk is good to drink.
Well, anyway, then we would come to the hallway.
It is very like our own hallway as far as you can see, only it may be quite different beyond that.
Oh, Dinah, wouldn't it be nice if we could get through to...
I can see all of the looking-glass room from here, all but a bit.
I would so like to see that little bit just behind the fireplace.
Do you think, Dinah, that if I pressed very, very hard and tried to look straight down, that I might...
Why, why...
Well, I knew this part of the room would be different.
But I do wish the looking-glass chair had moved when I moved ours.
There seems no other way.
If I could only fall like that all the time!
Can't be English.
Of course.
It's the looking-glass room.
Why, it's Uncle and Aunt!
I knew that if you could really get behind a picture, you'd see the backs of people.
Poor Uncle Gilbert. His trousers are all patched.
My dear niece, how would you like being framed in one pair of trousers for 20 years without being patched?
It must be very difficult.
It is.
But after all, it's only the front of a picture that counts, really.
Of course.
That is all.
8:00.
What did you say?
8:00.
But your hands say 20 minutes to 4:00.
I never let my left hand know what my right hand is doing.
This side of the looking glass has me all confused.
That's because everything is backward on your side.
Why, I... I never...
Mama! Mama!
What's that?
It's the voice of my child!
Your child!
Oh, my precious lily!
My imperial kitten!
I must be with my child.
Let me help you.
Mama! Mama! Dear me.
There, there, my royal pawn.
Watch out for the volcano.
It blew me up!
Be sure you come up the regular way.
Don't get blown up.
You'll be hours and hours getting to the table at that rate.
I'd far better help you.
No, no!
The King's men!
Somebody call out the King's men!
I assure you, my dear, I shall never, never forget the horror of this moment.
Well, you will forget, unless you make a memorandum of it.
I shall be very happy to remind you.
We will not be reminded by a volcano.
I'm not a volcano, and I'm not a cyclone, either.
Then you're either a cyclano or a volcone.
And...
Well, what time was that?
I really haven't any idea, but it's very late.
I must hurry or I shall have to go back through the looking glass before I've seen what the rest of the house is like.
My, what a strange way to walk about the garden.
The Duchess! The Duchess! Won't she be savage if I've kept her waiting!
Oh, dear! Oh, dear! I shall be too late!
My ears and whiskers, how late it is getting!
Well, after such a fall as this,
I shall think nothing of tumbling downstairs.
I wish Dinah were here.
That's such pretty music.
Oh, dear.
Ouch.
Goodbye, dear feet.
Oh, will I ever get to the beautiful garden?
Oh, Mouse!
Do you know the way out of this pool, oh, Mouse?
I'm very tired of swimming about here.
Perhaps you don't understand English.
I daresay you're a French mouse.
That's French for, "Where is my cat?"
I beg your pardon. I quite forgot you didn't like cats.
Wait, oh, Mouse!
Oh, Mouse!
Not like cats?
Would you like cats if you were me?
Don't be angry.
I wish I could show you our cat Dinah.
You'd take quite a fancy to her.
She's such a dear, quiet thing, and so good at catching mice.
Oh, I beg your pardon.
I hate you!
I hate cats!
My whole family hates cats. Nasty, low, vulgar things!
Oh, dear!
Wait, oh, Mouse!
Cats!
Cats!
Cats!
William the Conqueror, whose cause was favored by the pope, was soon submitted to by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest.
Who are you, please?
I am a dodo.
How do you do?
My name is Alice.
And you are very wet.
I'm afraid I am, but there isn't much I can do about getting dry.
History is the driest thing I know. Shall we dry you with history?
I'd be much obliged if you could.
Listen well.
Edwin and Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria, found it advisable to go with Edgar Aetheling to meet William and offer him the crown.
William's conduct at first was moderate, but the insolence of his Normans...
How are you getting on, my dear?
Beautifully, thank you.
Shall I put you to sleep now?
No, thank you!
Then you'd best run along. I'm about to recite some dates.
Yes, sir. Thank you.
Goodbye.
1585, Shakespeare was born, 1616, Shakespeare died...
Who are you?
I hardly know, sir, just at present.
At least, I know who I was when I got up this morning, but I must have changed several times since then.
What do you mean by that?
Explain yourself.
I can't explain myself, because I'm not myself, you see.
I don't see!
I can't put it more clearly, for I can't understand it myself to begin with.
And being so many different sizes in one day is confusing.
It isn't.
Well, when some day you turn into a chrysalis, and after that into a butterfly, you'll find it a bit queer, won't you?
Not a bit!
Well, maybe you wouldn't, but it would certainly feel very queer to me.
You?
Who are you?
I think you ought to tell me who you are first.
Why?
Good day, sir.
Come back.
I have something important to say.
Yes?
Keep your temper.
Is that all?
No.
So you think you've changed, do you?
I'm afraid I have, sir.
What size do you want to be?
I should like to be a little larger, sir, if you wouldn't mind.
Three inches is such a horrid height to be.
I am three inches high!
It's a very good height to be!
I'm sure it must be, sir, but you see, I'm not used to it.
You'll get used to it in time.
One side will make you grow taller.
The other side will make you grow shorter.
One side of... Of what?
The mushroom.
Which side will make me grow larger?
The large-making side, of course.
I'll take a little of both to make sure.
Oh, dear, now I'm too big again, oh, Caterpillar.
Mr. Caterpillar, sir, where are you?
Whoever lives here, it would never do to come upon them this size.
Why, I should frighten them out of their wits.
For the Duchess.
An invitation from the Queen to play croquet.
My compliments to the Queen.
My compliments to the Duchess.
There's no sort of use in your knocking.
Please, sir, how am I to get in?
I shall sit here till tomorrow.
I'm sorry you were hit, but how am I to get in?
I shall sit here for days and days.
But what am I to do?
Anything you like.
Please watch out for the baby!
She nearly killed the poor little thing.
If everybody minded their own business, the world would go round much faster than it does.
Speak roughly to your little boy And beat him when he sneezes
He only does it to annoy Because he knows it teases
Wow!
Wow! Wow!
Wow!
Wow!
Wow!
He only does it to annoy Because he knows it teases
Here, you can nurse it a bit if you like.
Now, I must go and get ready to play croquet with the Queen.
Don't grunt.
That's not at all a proper way of expressing yourself.
What am I going to do with this creature when I get it home?
If you're going to turn into a pig, my dear,
I'll have nothing more to do with you.
There's no mistake about you now.
You're a pig!
You would have grown up to be a dreadfully ugly child, but you do make a handsome pig, I think.
Why do you grin, oh, cat?
Because I'm a Cheshire Cat, that's why.
Well, then, Cheshire puss, would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?
That depends a good deal on where you want to get to.
I don't care much where.
Then it doesn't matter which way you go.
So long as I get somewhere.
You're sure to do that, if you only walk long enough.
Do you play croquet with the Queen today?
I should like it very much, but I haven't been invited yet.
You'll see me there.
Must you go so soon?
By the by, what became of the baby?
I'd nearly forgotten to ask.
It turned into a pig.
I thought it would.
Did you say pig or fig?
I said pig and I wish you wouldn't keep appearing and vanishing so suddenly.
You make one quite giddy.
All right.
Don't you wish you could do this?
Well, I've often seen a cat without a grin, but a grin without a cat?
No room! No room! No room!
No room! There's plenty of room!
Have some wine?
I don't see any wine.
There isn't any.
It wasn't very civil of you to offer it.
Your hair needs cutting.
You should not make personal remarks.
It's very rude. Why is a raven like a writing desk?
I believe I can answer that.
Do you mean you can find the answer to it?
Exactly so.
You should say what you mean.
What day of the month is it?
Fourth.
Ah! Two days wrong.
I told you that butter wouldn't suit the works.
Oh!
Some crumbs must have got in it as well.
Hmm.
I put it in with a bread knife.
It was the best butter, you know.
What a funny watch!
It tells the days of the month, but doesn't tell what "o'clock" it is.
Have you guessed the riddle yet?
Why...
Why, no. I give it up.
What is the answer?
I haven't the slightest idea!
Nor I!
I think you might do something better with time than wasting it asking a lot of riddles that have no answers.
Don't you speak about Time. I daresay you've never even spoken to him.
Perhaps not.
Time and I quarreled last March, just before he went mad, you know.
It was at a great concert given by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing, "Twinkle, twinkle, little bat How I wonder what you're at"
You know the song, perhaps?
I've heard something like it.
It goes on, you know, like this.
Twinkle, twinkle, little bat
How I wonder what you're at
Up above the world you fly Like a tea tray in the sky
Up above the world you fly
Like a tea tray in the sky
Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle...
Twinkle, twinkle, little bat
How I wonder what you're at
Up above the world you fly Like a tea tray in the sky
Up above the world you fly Like a tea tray in the sky
Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle Twinkle, twinkle...
Well, I'd hardly finished the first verse when the Queen bawled,
He's murdering the Time!
Off with his head!"
And ever since that, he won't do a thing I ask.
It's always 6:00 now.
Is that why all the tea things are out here?
Yes, that's it.
It's always teatime, and we have no time to wash the tea things in between.
Take some more tea.
I haven't had any yet, so I can't take more.
You mean you can't take less.
It is very easy to take more than nothing.
I want a clean cup.
It's the stupidest tea party I ever was at in all my life!
Very curious!
Would you please tell me why are you painting those roses?
Well, as a matter of fact, Miss, this tree should have been a red rose tree and we put in a white one by mistake, and if the Queen should find out, we'll all have our heads cut off.
So, you see, Miss, we're doing our best before she comes back to paint...
The Queen!
The Queen!
Her Majesty, the Queen of Hearts.
Her Majesty, the Queen!
Off with his head!
Off with his head!
What is your name, child?
My name is Alice, so please Your Majesty.
Off with her head!
Off with her head!
Nonsense!
Off with her head!
Off with her head!
Consider, my dear. She's only a child.
Off with her head!
Off with her head!
And besides, this is the executioners' day off.
It is, is it?
Well, they shall lose their heads for this!
Can you play croquet?
Yes.
Then let the game begin at once.
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!
Hurry! Must I behead you all?
Here, take it.
Play.
Off with some heads.
You're pointing the wrong way for a mallet!
Pardon me. My back hurts.
Don't look at me. I'm as mixed up as you are!
This game's slowing up.
Off with some heads!
Where are my victims?
Search the hedges.
Thrash the bushes.
Shake the trees!
How glad I am to see you again, you dear old thing.
How did you like your game?
Well, it was very exciting.
Of course it is.
And the moral of that is, "Be what you would like to be."
Or, to put it more simply, "Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise
than what it might appear to others that what you were or might have been
wasn't otherwise than what you had been "would have appeared to them to be otherwise."
I should understand that better if it were written down.
I can't quite follow it as you say it.
That's nothing to what I could say, if I chose.
And the moral of that is...
It's a fine day, Your Majesty.
I give you fair warning.
Either you or your head must be off at once!
Please, Your Majesty, could you make it go away?
Queen! Queen!
Where are you, Queen?
What fun!
What is the fun?
The Queen.
They never really execute anybody she condemns, you know.
The King...
The King pardons everybody.
I'm very happy to know that, I'm sure.
Have you seen the Mock Turtle yet?
Why...
Why, no.
I don't even know what a Mock Turtle is.
It's what mock turtle soup's made from.
Come here, will you, Mock Turtle, old thing?
What is his sorrow?
It's all his fancy.
He hasn't got no sorrow.
No sorrow, indeed.
Mine are the sorrows of a sorrowful sorrow.
Mine are the woes of a woeful woe. Mine are the...
This here young lady, she wants for to know your history, she do.
I'll tell it her.
Sit down, both of you, and don't speak a word till I've finished.
Once I was a real turtle.
Oh, dear!
Oh, dear!
When we were little, we went to school in the sea.
The master was an old turtle.
We used to call him Tortoise.
Why did you call him Tortoise if he wasn't one?
We called him Tortoise because he taught us.
You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question.
We went to school in the sea, though you mayn't believe it.
I never said I didn't.
You did.
Hold your tongue!
We had the best of educations.
In fact, we went to school every day.
I've been to a day school, too. We learned French and music.
I only took the regular course.
What was that?
Reeling and writhing to begin with.
And then the different branches of arithmetic, ambition, distraction, uglification and derision.
And how many hours a day did you do lessons?
Ten hours the first day and nine the next and so on.
That's why they're called lessons, because they lessen from day to day.
Then the 11th day must have been a holiday.
Of course.
And how did you manage on the 12th day?
Well, that's enough about lessons.
Shall we play games, or shall the Mock Turtle sing?
Oh, a song, please, if the Mock Turtle would be so kind.
No accounting for tastes.
Sing her Turtle Soup, will you, old fellow?
In a moment.
Beautiful soup Who cares for fish Game, or any other dish?
Who would not give all else for two Pennyworth only of beautiful soup?
Pennyworth only of beautiful soup Beautiful soup, beautiful soup
Soup of the evening Beautiful soup, beautiful...
Faster! Faster!
Faster! Faster! Faster!
Much faster!
Are we nearly there?
Nearly there?
Why, we passed it 10 minutes ago.
Faster!
It's all marked out like a chessboard.
Of course it's a chessboard, and life is a chessboard, and you are a Queen's pawn.
You will go immediately to the fourth square, which you should reach in exactly no time.
Did you remark something?
I didn't know I had to make one just then.
You should have told me how kind it is of me to tell you all this.
No questions?
Very well, then, no answers.
Open your mouth wide when you speak, and always speak in French if you can't think of the English for something.
Turn out your toes as you walk and always say "Your Majesty," and so forth.
If you think we're waxworks, you ought to pay, you know.
Waxworks weren't made to be looked at for nothing, nohow.
Contrary-wise, if you think we're alive, you ought to speak.
I'm sure I'm very sorry.
I was wondering which is the best way out of this wood.
Would you tell me, please?
You've begun wrong.
The first thing in a visit is to say,
How do you do?" And shake hands.
I hope you're not much tired.
Why, nohow, but thank you very much for asking.
So much obliged.
You like poetry?
Yes, pretty well.
Some poetry.
But would you tell me first which road leads out of the woods?
What shall I repeat to her?
The Walrus and the Carpenter is the longest.
The sun was shining on the sea Shining with all his might
He did his very best to make The billows smooth and bright
And this was odd because it was The middle of the night
The Walrus and the Carpenter Were walking close at hand
They wept like anything to see Such quantities of sand
'lf this were only cleared away' They said, 'it would be grand'
'lf seven maids with seven mops Swept it for half a year
'Do you suppose,' the Walrus said
'That they could get it clear?"'
'I doubt it,' said the Carpenter And shed a bitter tear"
'Oh, oyster, come and walk with us, ' The Walrus did beseech
'A pleasant walk, a pleasant talk Along the briny beach'
They could not do with more than four To give a hand to each
The eldest oyster looked at him But never a word he said
The eldest oyster winked his eye And shook his heavy head
Meaning to say he did not choose To leave the oyster bed
But younger oysters hurried up All eager for the treat
Their coats were brushed Their faces washed "Their shoes were clean and neat
And this was odd because, you know They hadn't any feet
'The time has come,' the Walrus said 'To talk of many things
'Of shoes and ships and sealing wax Of cabbages and kings"
'And why the sea is boiling hot And whether pigs have wings"'
'A loaf of bread,' the Walrus said 'ls what we chiefly need
'Pepper and vinegar besides Are very good indeed
'Now, if you're ready, oysters dear We can begin to feed'
'But not on us, ' the oysters cried Turning a little blue
'After such kindness that would be A dismal thing to do!
'The night is fine,' the Walrus said 'Do you admire the view?
'I weep for you,' the Walrus said 'I deeply sympathize'
With sobs and tears he sorted out Those of the largest size
Holding his pocket handkerchief Before his streaming eyes
'Oh, oyster,' said the Carpenter 'You've had a pleasant run
'Shall we be trotting home again?
' But answer came there none
And this was scarcely odd because They'd eaten every one"
Well, they were both very unpleasant characters.
But at any rate, I'd better be leaving the wood because it's really getting very dark.
Well, goodbye.
Look! Do you see that?
It's only a rattle.
Only an old rattle, quite old and broken.
I knew it was.
It's spoiled, of course.
My nice new rattle.
Of course, you agree to have a battle?
I suppose so.
Only she must help us to dress up, you know.
Of course!
Tweedledee and Tweedledum Agreed to have a battle
For Tweedledee said Tweedledum "Had spoiled his nice new rattle
Just then down flew a monstrous crow As black as a tar barrel
Which frightened both the heroes so "They quite forgot their quarrel"
I hope you're good at pinning and tying string.
All this has got to go on somehow or other.
This is to keep my head from being cut off.
You know, one of the most serious things that can happen to one in a battle is to get one's head cut off.
Do I look very pale?
Well, yes, a little.
I'm very brave generally, only today I happen to have a headache.
Well, I've got a toothache. I'm far worse than you.
Then you'd both better not fight today.
We must have a bit of a fight.
Let's fight till 6:00 and then have dinner.
There's only one sword, but you can have the umbrella.
Only we must begin quick. It's getting very, very dark.
And darker and darker.
What a thick black cloud that is, and how fast it comes!
Why, I do believe it's got wings.
It's the crow! The crow!
May I put your shawl straight for you?
I don't know what's the matter with it.
It's out of temper, I think.
I've pinned it here and I've pinned it there, but there's no pleasing it.
It can't go on straight, you know, if you put all the pins on one side.
And dear me, what a state your hair is in!
Oh, the brush has got entangled in it.
And I lost the comb yesterday.
There, now you look better.
My finger's bleeding.
What's the matter?
Have you pricked your finger?
I haven't pricked it yet, but I soon shall.
When I fasten my shawl again, the broach will come undone.
Watch out, you're holding it all wrong.
Now you understand the way things happen here.
But why don't you scream now?
Why, I've done all the screaming already.
Now, what would be the good of doing it all over again?
I suppose so.
Well, it's a bit lighter now.
I'm glad that crow is gone.
I hope your finger's better now.
Better, better, better. Much better.
What is it you want to buy?
I should like to buy an egg, please.
I never put things into people's hands.
That would never do.
You must get it for yourself.
What a strange egg!
It keeps growing much faster than it should!
Curiouser and curiouser!
It's bigger than a chicken!
Why, it's... It's Humpty-Dumpty!
Don't stand there staring at me as if I were an egg.
Tell me your name and your business.
My name is Alice.
It's a stupid enough name. What does it mean?
Must a name mean something?
Of course it must.
My name means the shape I am, and a right handsome shape it is.
With your name, you might be any shape.
Why do you sit out here all alone?
Because there's nobody with me.
Did you think I couldn't answer that?
Ask another.
Don't you think you'd be safer on the ground?
That wall is so very narrow.
Of course I don't think so.
Why, if I ever did fall off, which there's no chance of, but if I did...
If I did fall, the King has promised me...
To send all his horses and all his men.
Ah, so, you know. All his horses and all his men.
They'd pick me up again in a minute, they would.
However, this conversation is going on a little too fast.
Let's go back to the last remark but one.
I'm afraid I can't quite remember it.
In that case, we start afresh, and it's my turn to choose a subject.
How old did you say you were?
Twelve years and four months.
Wrong.
You never said a word like it.
I thought you meant, "How old are you?"
If I'd meant that, I'd have said that.
Twelve years and four months.
An uncomfortable sort of age.
Now, my advice would have been to leave off at 12, but it's too late now.
What a beautiful belt!
Or is it a beautiful collar?
It is a most provoking thing when a person doesn't know a collar from a belt.
I know it's very ignorant of me.
It's a collar, child, and a beautiful one, as you say.
It's a present from the White King and Queen.
Is it really?
They gave it to me for an un-birthday present.
I beg your pardon?
I am not offended, and it isn't respectable to beg.
I mean, what is an un-birthday present?
A present given when it isn't your birthday, of course.
I like birthday presents best.
You don't know what you're talking about.
How many days are there in a year?
Three hundred and sixty-five.
And how many birthdays have you?
One.
And if you take that from 365, what remains?
Three hundred and sixty-four, of course.
Well then, there are 364 days when you might get un-birthday presents.
Certainly.
And only one for birthday presents.
That's glory for you!
I don't know what you mean by glory.
Of course you don't, till I tell you.
I meant there's a nice knock-down argument for you.
But glory doesn't mean that.
When I use a word, it means what I choose it to mean, neither more or less.
The question is whether you can make words mean different things.
The question is, which is to be the master, you or the word? That's all.
However, I can manage the whole lot.
Impenetrability, that's what I say.
Would you tell me, please, what that means?
I meant by impenetrability that we've had enough of the subject, and it would be just as well if you would mention what you mean to do next, as I suppose you don't mean to stop here all the rest of your life.
Fancy it meaning all that.
You seem very clever at explaining words, sir.
Would you kindly tell me the meaning of a poem called Jabberwocky?
I read it a long time ago.
I can, but I won't. That's all.
Goodbye.
Goodbye, till we meet again.
I shouldn't know you if we did meet. You're so exactly like other people.
The face is what one generally goes by.
That's just it.
Your face is the same as everybody's.
The two eyes, so. Nose in the middle, mouth under.
Now, if your two eyes were on the same side of your nose, or your mouth on the top, that would be some help.
It wouldn't look nice.
Wait till you've tried.
Watch out!
Help! Help!
I'm falling!
Tell the King!
Tell him to bring his horses and his men! Help!
What happened?
We ran into each other, Your Majesty.
Good. I rather fancied something like that had happened.
Oh, Your Majesty, Humpty-Dumpty fell off the wall!
I know, I know.
Four-thousand, two-hundred and seven of my soldiers are on the way.
Two without horses.
If all this King's horses and men can't put him back together again, nobody can.
I'm glad Humpty will be all right. I was worried.
Well, don't be.
Look along the road and tell me if you can see either of my three messengers.
I see nobody on the road.
Oh, I only wish I had such eyes!
To be able to see nobody, and at that distance! Oh!
It's too, too bad!
Can I help you, sir?
On or off?
You are on.
In a short time I shall be off again.
I'm so sorry.
Are you the King's messenger?
I am the White Knight.
I see you're admiring my little box.
It's my own invention, to keep clothes and sandwiches in.
You see, I carry it upside down so the rain can't come in.
But the things can get out.
Do you know the lid is open?
Then if all the things have fallen out, the box is no use without them.
Can you guess why I did that?
I can't imagine.
In hopes some bees may make a nest in it.
Then I should get the honey.
But you've got a beehive, or something like one, fastened to the saddle.
It's a very good beehive, too.
One of the best kind, but not a single bee has come near it yet.
That other thing's a mousetrap.
I suppose the mice keep the bees out or the bees keep the mice out.
It isn't very likely there would be any mice on a horse's back.
Not very likely, perhaps, but I don't choose to have them running all about.
You see, I'm well provided for everything.
That's the reason the horse has those anklets around his feet.
What are they for?
To guard against the bites of sharks.
It's my own invention.
But let's go on. I'll go with you to the edge of the wood.
I hope you've got your hair well-fastened on.
Only the usual way.
That's hardly enough.
You see, the wind is so strong here. It's strong as soup.
Have you invented a plan for keeping the hair from being blown off?
Not yet, but I have a plan for keeping the hair from falling off.
I should like to hear it very much.
First, you take an upright stick, then you make your hair creep up it like a vine.
Now, the reason hair falls off is because it hangs down.
Things never fall upward, you know.
It's my own invention.
You may try it if you like.
I'm a great hand at inventing things.
Now, I daresay you noticed the last time you picked me up, I was looking rather thoughtful.
You were a little grave.
Well, just then I was inventing a new way of getting over a gate.
Would you like to hear it?
Very much, indeed.
Well, I'll tell you how I came to think of it.
I said to myself,
The only difficulty is with the feet.
The head's high enough already."
Now, first I put my head on top of the gate, then my head's high enough, then I stand on my head, then my feet are high enough.
Then I'm over.
Sir Knight!
If there were only a gate down here, I'd be in excellent position to cross it.
How can you go on talking so quietly with your head in a ditch?
What does it matter where my body happens to be?
My mind goes on working all the same.
In fact, I once invented a new pudding during the meat course.
In time to have it cooked for the next course?
Hmm. That was quick work.
Well, not the next course.
In fact, I don't believe that pudding ever was cooked.
What did you mean it to be made of?
Well, it began with blotting paper.
That wouldn't be very nice, I'm afraid.
Not very nice alone, but imagine how good it would be mixed with other things, such as gunpowder and sealing wax.
And here I must leave you. This is the end of the wood.
You've only a few yards to go.
Down the hill, across that little brook, and then you'll be a queen.
At last!
But you'll stay and see me off first?
I shan't be long.
You'll wait?
Of course I'll wait.
I think it'll encourage me.
Thank you very much for coming so far out of your way.
For that, I shall expect you to cry a good deal as I go.
The poor, dear Knight.
He's the nicest person yet.
Well, here I am.
What's this?
A crown!
A golden crown!
I'm a queen!
I'm a queen!
How dare you say that you're a queen.
What right have you to call yourself so?
You can't be a queen, you know, till you've passed the proper examination, and the sooner we begin it, the better.
Be seated.
I'm ready, Your Majesties.
Can you do addition?
Now what's one and one and one and one and one and one, one and one?
I don't know. I lost count.
She can't do addition.
Can you answer any useful questions?
How is bread made?
I know that.
You take some flour...
Where do you pick the flower, in a garden or in the hedges?
It isn't picked at all, it's ground.
But how many acres of ground?
I wish you wouldn't leave out so many things!
Oh, dear.
You know any languages?
What's the French for "fiddle-de-dee"?
Fiddle-de-dee's not English.
Whoever said it was?
Well, if you'll tell me what language fiddle-de-dee is, I'll tell you the French for it.
Queens never make bargains!
I'm so sleepy.
She's tired, poor thing.
So, smooth her hair, lend her your nightcap and sing her a soothing lullaby.
I haven't any nightcap, and I don't know any soothing lullabies.
I'll have to do it myself.
Hush-a-bye lady in Alice's lap
When the feast's ready we've time for a nap
When the feast's over we'll go to the ball
Red Queen and White Queen and Alice and all
Now that you know the words, sing it through to me.
I'm sleepy, too.
Now what am I to do?
Do wake up. To the looking-glass world
It was Alice that said
I've a scepter in hand
I've a crown on my head"
No admittance until week after next.
Why...
Why, how dare you!
Fill up the glasses as quick as you can
And sprinkle the table With buttons and bran
Put cats in the coffee and mice in the tea
And welcome Queen Alice with 30 times three
Put cats in the coffee and mice in the tea
And welcome Queen Alice With 30 times three
Then put in the glasses, molasses and ink
And anything else that is pleasant to drink
Mix sand with the cider And wool with the wine
And welcome Queen Alice With 90 times nine
Mix sand with the cider And wool with the wine
And welcome Queen Alice With 90 times 90 times 90 times nine
You've missed the soup and fish!
Serve the roast!
You seem a little shy.
Let me introduce you to that leg of mutton.
Alice, Leg of Mutton.
Leg of Mutton, Alice.
How do you do?
May I give you a slice?
Certainly not!
It isn't etiquette to cut somebody you've been introduced to.
Remove the roast!
Please don't introduce the Pudding, or we shall get no dinner at all.
May I give you some?
Pudding, Alice.
Alice, Pudding.
What impertinence!
How would you like it if I were to cut a slice out of you, you creature?
Make a remark.
It's ridiculous to leave all the conversation to the Pudding.
Well...
You'd better prepare.
We're about to drink to your health.
Queen Alice's health!
Queen Alice's health!
Queen Alice!
Queen Alice!
She ought to make a speech.
A speech!
So she ought! A speech! A speech!
A speech!
A speech!
Speech!
Speech!
I rise to return thanks.
Take care! Something's going to happen!
Something's going to happen!
There was a looking-glass room, and you were the Red Queen.
There was a whole looking-glass country.
Are you all right, sir?
Better ask my nurse.
My English is not good enough for me to know.
That daughter of mine seems to be knocking 'em cold before her time, doesn't she?
Knocking them cold"? What does it mean?
It's just an expression.
Lucky if you didn't catch your death of cold.
Hello, Louis. Whoo!
Good thing you didn't lose your head.
It was a very awk... awkward moment. - Sorry I upset you.
Don't mind.
Come along now.
We've been here quite long enough.
Well, I think I must go back to the hotel now.
No more jumping?
No, that was my last chance.
Oh. Your fault, terrible woman!
It wasn't. It was a silly little dog.
I might have been killed, you know.
You realize my last day here might have been my last day on earth?
Your last day here? - Mm-hmm.
You're not leaving tonight, are you, Louis?
I'm afraid yes, by the last train.
Oh, Uncle Louis.
Why do you call me "uncle"?
Well, you're just like an uncle, aren't you?
How dare you, miss!
We shall miss you, Louis.
Mummy will cry her eyes out.
Won't she, Daddy?
Yes, dear.
Do you think so?
Oh, she adores you. - Doesn't she, Daddy?
Yes, dear.
I'm desolate to go.
As it is my last night... would you and your charming wife accept to have dinner with me tonight?
She'd love it. Both of us.
Good.
Uncle Louis? - Hmm? - I get awfully hungry in the evening.
Yes, you get awfully sleepy too, darling. Long after your bedtime, my child.
Oh, let me sit up. I'll sleep overtime tomorrow.
We'll ask your mother. - Oh, yes.
Let's.
Where is Jill? - Mm.
She's working off the finals of the clay-pigeon shooting. - I see.
I do hope she wins, don't you?
Who is against her?
That fellow Ramon. - Aha.
Well, then, she's got to win.
Don't like him, Trouble?
Do you? I don't know.
He's all right.
He's a bit of a bore, but he means well, doesn't he?
Why don't you like him?
He's got many too many teeth and...
and too much brilliantine.
Sworn enemies, eh?
You English have such a sense of humor.
Well, I can't say that I hope you'll win.
I'm sure that you will.
You're so beautiful.
Yes, well, let's get on with it, shall we?
Well, are you ready?
Mummy, may I stay up tonight?
Oh, darling, ask me presently.
Oh, say yes now, just for luck.
You little wretch. Look. Here's that broach you wanted.
Now will you run away and be quiet?
Oh!
Shh!
Daddy, don't you like it? Mummy gave it to me.
Shut up, darling.
Shh! - Sorry.
Hello.
I'm not a baby.
Let that be a lesson to you:
Never have any children.
That was your fault, fathead.
It wasn't!
Betty. You know your child's going to cost me the match, don't you?
She's your child as well as mine, isn't she?
If I lose this game, I'll disown her forever.
Shh!
I am sorry that you lost, Madame Lawrence... but I am delighted that I won, if you understand me.
You're a marvelous shot, and I know what I'm talking about.
You'll make me blush.
We must have another battle one day. Shall we?
I shall live for that moment.
Well, you would have this child.
Oh, Madame Lawrence, you English are extraordinaire.
Ah! My love!
Ah, my darling.
You can keep your brat.
Thank you.
I'm just going off with another man.
Darling, you go to bed early... with Betty.
Poor Daddy.
Sir, you have beaten my wife, and she has gone off with another man.
You are a dirty dog.
You are as comical as your charming wife.
Is that Mummy's knitting?
Yes. Why?
Donnez-moi. Bung it over.
Go on, Louis. Perform.
What do you mean?
Do your stuff.
What do you think of the average Englishman?
Much too cold... except when he drinks too much, of course.
Is that jumper for him?
Of course it is. Did you think it was for you?
It's a memento.
To wear over my beating heart.
Is this thing fireproof?
Daddy, don't!
Oh, look.
I'm sorry.
Quick!
Tell Bob... my room... a brush in my room.
Take it to the British consul... or to...
Gibson.
Louis!
Don't breathe a word... to anyone. Don't breathe...
Betty, will you be a good girl and run up to bed?
Go along, darling. Buzz off.
It's all right.
It's a bullet. - ... smashed the window.
Any letters?
Yes, sir. Two.
Bob. - What's the matter, love?
He's dead.
It's horrible. - Good God.
Listen, there's something behind all this.
Pull yourself together. He said you were to go to straight to his room.
Something about a brush. Here's the key. He gave it to me.
Bob, what can this all mean?
Well, we'll soon find out.
Is anything the matter? - Nothing.
Nothing at all.
If I were you, and I found some... - Come on. Hand it over. -
Pardon, sir, but no doubt there is some explanation. - Of what?
Of why... why you were in that room.
Monsieur Bernard's room. It is irregular.
Oh, yes, that.
That... That's easy to explain.
Anything I can do to help?
Can you get the British consul on the phone, please?
No doubt, but first...
Yes, first.
I've got something very vital to tell him.
The British consul?
Yes, please.
Perhaps it will better if you will kindly come to my private room for a moment.
Of course I will. Certainly.
Thank you very much.
It is the purest formality. - Yes, of course.
You will pardon me, but in my position...
Of course. It's quite all right.
This way, sir, please.
You won't forget that I want to speak to the British consul on the phone, will you?
Presently, mein Herr. Certainly. At once.
I must go in and talk to my wife.
I'm very sorry... but the commissary wishes to see each one separately. It is formal.
But you know him well. He was your friend.
Yes, he was, but we knew very little of him. Hardly anything.
Excuse me. Do you, um... Can you tell me if the British consul is in town today?
Can you... The British...
Der britische Konsul... You know, the man who copes with parcels... is he here? - Hier?
Ja, er ist ein Herr.
No, I don't mean is he a Herr, a man. Is he here?
Hier?
Nein.
Uh, listen. Is he here in St. Moritz?
Look... der britische Konsul...
Oh, damn.
I can't remember how far he was standing from the window. - Everything was so sudden. - Think, madame.
You must let me go in and talk to my wife.
But you cannot, sir. The commissary is giving orders. He is in charge here.
What can I do? Please excuse.
But, uh...
Sie dürfen hier nicht rein. - Now, listen. - If you don't mind, I must...
Was?
Herr Lawrence.
Please.
Oh, thanks so much.
It was left at the desk of the hall porter.
It was marked "very urgent."
Thank you. That's fine.
He said you have to go. - I'm sorry.
Excuse me. I've got a message for my wife.
The, uh... The Michisons can't come to lunch tomorrow.
Perhaps we'd better put the other people off too.
What is that note?
Give to me.
I've nothing to add to what I've already said, Inspector.
Nothing whatever.
It's no use talking like that, Mr. Lawrence.
It just won't do.
Now, uh, on March the 10th... you and Mrs. Lawrence went to Switzerland.
Thank you.
To St. Moritz.
Yes.
With your little daughter. - Yes.
Whiskey and soda? - Oh, thank you.
On March the 19th, you returned to London.
Bup, bup, bup, bup.
Yes.
Thank you.
You returned to London... without your little daughter.
Yes. One for you?
Thank you.
Where is she?
Staying with her aunt. - Oh?
What's this aunt's name?
Mary.
And where is she staying with this aunt?
In Paris.
Street and number?
It's a complicated French name.
Rather difficult for an English person to remember, I'm afraid. - One for you?
By the way... why were you so upset the night you left Switzerland?
I'm not aware as I was upset.
Was it because your child had been... kidnapped?
And another thing. My point is this...
He's not the sort of chap to give things away and lose his head... and spill the beans, and all that sort of business.
See what I mean?
When I was in the navy...
Is that train electric?
Yes. Twenty volts.
Best present I ever gave the kid.
Doesn't play with it much now, does she? - She never did.
You never gave her the chance.
I say, you mustn't get jumpy.
Really, you mustn't.
What I mean to say is, uh, once you begin that sort of thing... lose grip and, uh... and...
I know.
I'm all right.
Oh, Clive... you've got Pullmans and coal trucks on the same train.
Good Lord, I have!
So is that your last word, sir? - Absolutely.
I'm sorry to have to say it, sir, but I don't believe you.
It's your duty as a citizen, Mr. Lawrence.
Thanks for calling.
You may be sorry.
Don't drop in again.
Hello, are you still here? You lost your whistle or something?
I'm not a policeman.
My name's Gibson.
I'm secretary to Sir Norman Wood at the Foreign Office.
Oh, really?
Never heard of him.
However, how do you do?
Your friend Louis was one of our people...
Special Service.
You didn't know that, did you?
I'm afraid not, no.
You didn't happen to find anything in this brush, did you?
Nothing much. I'm terribly busy...
But enough to justify somebody kidnapping your child to keep your mouth shut.
I never said so.
Nonsense.
When Louis Bernard was killed, there was a paper in this brush.
How terribly thrilling.
Darling, you haven't told them anything, have you?
Not yet, Mrs. Lawrence, but I think he's just about to.
Jill, dear, this is Mr. Gibson of the Foreign Office come to see us.
How do you do?
Oh, I... Of course, I quite understand.
But I think if you'll listen to me, you'll appreciate why I have to bother you.
Has either of you heard of a foreign statesman of the name of Ropa?
I don't think so. Have we, dear? - R-O-P-A.
No.
If you haven't heard of him... I suppose it doesn't worry you much if he's likely to be assassinated.
What's that got to do with us?
A little patience, Mrs. Lawrence, and I think you'll see.
Louis Bernard was killed... because he knew of a plot to assassinate Ropa.
A few hours later, your child was kidnapped. Why?
Because by that time you were in possession of that vital information.
It was written on the piece of paper you found in Bernard's shaving brush.
Mr. Lawrence, Ropa is in London, and an attempt may be made on his life.
My department must protect him.
Now, will you tell me what was on that paper? I'm sorry.
I'm afraid I can't.
But I can tell you what was written on another piece of paper... that our child had been kidnapped... and if we spoke, we'd never see her again.
It's her life against this fellow Ropa's.
Why should we care if some foreign statesman... we'd never even heard of were assassinated?
Tell me: In June 1914... had you ever heard of a place called Sarajevo?
Of course you hadn't. I doubt if you'd even heard of the Archduke Ferdinand.
But in a month's time, because a man you'd never heard of... killed another man you'd never heard of... in a place you'd never heard of, this country was at war.
But...
Don't tell him, Bob.
I'm sorry, Mr. Gibson, but we're not interested.
What you've told us may be true, but our child's in danger.
That comes first. It must come first. You see that, don't you?
Mrs. Lawrence, do you realize the type of men we're dealing with?
Do you think they draw the line at murder?
Besides, how do you know the child's alive? How do you know they... All right.
Hold on a minute.
Someone on the phone in the hall. It's about... about Betty.
Switch it through here.
All right. I will.
Hello?
Good afternoon, Mr. Lawrence. Please listen very carefully.
We don't want to interrupt your chat... with the gentleman from the Foreign Office... but we think we ought to remind you that if you tell him anything... you will never see your child again.
Just a final warning.
Yes, but I I want...
Bob, what is it?
Somebody playing the fool or something. Hello?
If you think somebody's fooling you... perhaps you'd like to speak to the child yourself.
Hello, Daddy.
Betty!
Hello, my darling.
Hello, Mother.
Is that you?
Are you all right?
Yes, Mummy.
Plenty to eat?
Ask her where she is.
Yes, Mummy.
Are you getting on without me, Mummy?
I'm missing you terribly, darling.
Uncle Clive and I have been... been playing with your trains.
Ask her where she is.
Mummy, I want to come home!
Oh, I do want to come home! So you shall, darling.
Very soon.
Ask her where she is.
I'll come and fetch you.
Darling... where are you?
Mummy, they don't let me...
Darling?
Betty!
Steady, old girl, steady.
Did either of you recognize the first voice that spoke?
Oh, for God's sake!
I'm sorry, but can't you leave us alone?
Wouldn't it be possible to trace that call?
No, the telephone people would never tell.
Hello? Give me Special, please, quickly.
Hello? This is G speaking.
Were you listening? Where did the last call to this number come from?
Wapping? A public call box.
Notify Scotland Yard to have a plainclothesman posted... on every corner of the district.
Well, get them from other districts!
Wapping... does that convey anything to you?
Nothing whatever.
Well, if there is any trouble, I hope you'll remember you're to blame.
Not a very nice thing to have on your conscience.
It's all right, Bob. I'll see him out.
Ask Lawrence to talk it over again when I'm gone.
You know where to ring me if you want me.
Yes, thanks.
Clive, here a minute.
Yes?
Are you coming?
Where to?
Wapping.
Of course.
I'll get our hats and coats and things.
Why?
You know those plainclothesmen that Gibson ordered?
If these blokes who've got Betty see them, they'll think we've given them away.
Our only chance is to act ourselves, double quick.
I'm coming too.
No, darling. You stay here. Keep on the end of that telephone.
If there's any news, we'll get through to you.
Oh, darling, I can't risk losing both...
both of you.
Blow your nose. You won't lose either of us.
What about your food?
Leave me a bowl on the mat.
Here, do you want this?
There can't be many George Barbors in Wapping.
I couldn't drink another one in that pub anyway. Come on. Look.
What? Are they plainclothesmen over there?
All right. Come along.
In we go. - No, just a minute.
What?
Think these things are all right?
No, you look terrible.
I say, Clive, any questions asked, we're just off a boat. Good idea.
When I was in the navy...
How are your teeth?
It seems a pity.
Come on. - Let's make a dash for it.
Right-o.
A bit grim, isn't it?
Yes.
Good evening.
My pal here's got a rather bad toothache.
I'll look at it. All right.
Come along.
Here.
Oh, poor old boy.
Five shillings.
Five shillings.
Give him five shillings for me, will you, please?
Just a minute.
Better have a look at mine while we're about it. - What's wrong?
I've had terrible toothache today.
Have a look at them, will you?
You stay outside and keep your mouth shut.
Please.
Has he arrived?
Not yet.
Just off the ship?
Yes.
Which one? - Saxon.
She's not due until tomorrow.
Oh, no, I... I got off at, um... I got off at Tilbury.
Came on by train.
Tough skipper, old Turner.
Not half.
Left her last voyage.
Yes, of course, that's right. I...
What I meant was... - I was wrong. The voyage before last.
Yes, of course.
Slipped my memory.
Nothing much wrong with your teeth.
I think you're right.
It's not hurting as much as it was.
I'll be off.
Wait.
Why? What's the trouble?
There's one there better come out.
I think I'll chance it.
Sit down.
Doesn't a doctor have to do that?
Has he come?
Oh, there you are. Had a good crossing?
No. Sick all the way.
It is the last time I let myself be smuggled into this country... for you or anybody else.
You will be smuggled, my friend, when, how, and where...
I'm pleased for you to be smuggled. Yes?
It's your fault for having such a wonderful aim with your gun.
You must pay the price for your genius.
Everything ready for tonight?
I have arranged a box for you... most conveniently placed.
Any trouble with the charming Miss Lawrence?
As quiet as a little mouse.
And where is the little mouse now?
Oh, in a little... a little hole in the ground somewhere. You shall see.
Your last job tonight?
No, first.
Clive, which way did they go?
Where's Betty?
Found out anything?
Yes.
Shall I give Jill a ring? - No, no.
Come along. Hurry.
You sure they went in there? - Must have.
Almost certain.
I say, Clive. Look.
What are they, Bob?
Sun worshippers.
Probably they've got nothing on.
Come on. Let's go.
# Clive, Clive, Clive #
# That woman at the end #
# Half left to you and me #
# What is the row, old man #
# I don't see #
# What you mean #
# Stand by #
# There's trouble # # Coming soon ##
Perhaps those who may be among us tonight for the first time... and who have not yet become initiated into the mysteries... of the First Circle of the Seventh Old Ray... may be wondering what is going to happen now.
I will tell them.
Before proceeding to the mysteries, which are only for the initiate... it is of course necessary for the minds and souls of us all... to become purged and to be made clean.
I'm therefore going to ask anyone here who is not in tune with us... to submit to a very simple process of control.
Merely place him- or herself under the guidance of the Fourth Circle.
Is there anyone here tonight who would care...
Perhaps you.
Relax.
Keep your eyes fixed on this light.
Keep them fixed.
Before receiving the First Degree... of the Seventh Old Ray... your mind must be white and blank.
You are already feeling sleepy.
Do you hear me?
Yes.
Your mind is becoming quite blank.
You feel that, don't you?
Quite, quite blank.
Yes.
Quite... blank.
I think that will do for the moment.
Will all those who are not of the Fourth Circle... please leave as quietly as possible?
You're not going to leave your friend, sir... are you?
Hello.
Good evening.
I hope you weren't very rough with him.
You see, he's subject to apoplexy.
Who? - "Who"?
Poor old George Barbor down at Wapping.
Is it all right in here?
Thank you.
I ought to have mentioned it to you, perhaps.
You should learn to control your fatherly feelings... and not drop things on the floor, please.
Collected our brother's little offering yet, have you?
Oh, sir, I forgot.
Pardon me.
Dangerous.
Perhaps you would care to join our little circle now, Mr. Lawrence. - Yes?
Thank you very much. Excuse me.
Why, if it isn't our friend the sharpshooter.
Nice to see you again, Mr. Lawrence. Thank you.
Nice to see you.
Is my young daughter ready to go home yet? Oh, no, sir.
She's asleep...
No shooting! You don't want the police here, do you?
Start playing that organ, or they'll hear this noise outside.
Clive!
Clive!
Clive!
Clive!
Clive!
Through the window! Phone Jill!
Tell her to go to the Albert Hall!
Call the police!
Sorry.
Please forgive me.
Get on to Mrs. Lawrence.
Tell her if she goes to the Albert Hall tonight, her child is...
Come on.
Let me get... - Ho!
Mr. Lawrence, please.
Hello? - Hello.
Clive!
L-Listen, Jill.
You know that chap we were looking for? Yes. "A. Hall."
It isn't a chap at all. No, it's the real hall. Albert Hall.
The Albert Hall!
Betty... we're on to her all right.
Bob says you're to go to the Albert Hall. - Now?
Yes, now.
You're to do what you can. That's where it's happening. You're to stop it.
But... but when... - No, no, no.
No time now.
Must get off for the police.
Is that Mrs. Lawrence?
Mrs. Lawrence? I'm afraid she's just this minute gone out.
Will that be all for tonight, sir?
No.
I shall want you to stay, yes?
I'd rather go now, sir. My husband wants his supper.
Besides, I don't want to be mixed up in any nasty business.
Rawlings.
Hello.
See that Mrs. Sprocket stays, huh? See to it.
Are these poisoned?
Have a drink? Thanks very much.
I'll have a gin and French.
Is this where you write your sermons?
Sometimes.
Come, come. Don't blush, please.
Have you never been to the seaside?
You caught her?
No.
She'd gone.
Well, I've no doubt we can arrange... to deal with it in some other way.
It's my pal with the cops.
If he worries you, gentlemen, shoot and give him a bad leg.
No one will hear.
Ah, here he is again.
Officer, this gentleman has been a great trouble tonight.
Nothing of the kind, Officer. My pal has a little girl.
That's the whole point... He came down here to look for her. And these chaps...
I mean, this fellow here... they're crooks, Officer.
He's a little intoxicated, Officer.
His friend was bad enough, but he's worse, isn't he, Sister?
He's constantly creating scenes in this church.
Look here, the pair of you...
Disorderly behavior in a sacred edifice. Is that you want to charge him with?
Alas, yes.
We don't wish to press it, Officer, but we've been very patient.
Haven't we, Sister?
Oh, but, damn it, I...
What have you got to say for yourself? - Look here.
Tonight, my friend and I...
Where are they?
Who?
Well, the whistle. The whistle that was blowing just now.
Oh, yes.
The arm of the English law... needed help in taking our friend to the station.
Very, very reluctantly I have given him in charge.
For disorderly behavior in a sacred edifice.
I forgot.
The little one... shall she join us?
Do you mean Betty?
One of the sweetest children I ever met. Bring her, please.
You know, to a man with a heart as soft as mine... there's nothing sweeter than a touching scene.
Such as?
Such as a father saying good-bye to his child.
Yeah, good-bye for the last time.
What could be more touching than that?
I'm afraid if you expect a scene from me, you're going to be disappointed.
We shall see.
Why do you look at me like that?
Betty!
Daddy!
Daddy! - Oh!
You all right, darling?
I say, darling... awfully smart dressing gown.
Where did you get it? Hmm?
Betty...
Betty, I want to tell you something. - Here. Oi.
Listen, your school report's come.
Awfully good.
Let's go.
Where's Mummy?
Come on, tell her.
At the Albert Hall, my dear.
Oh, that reminds me. Your scene was so charming, I was almost forgetting.
What is it?
A record of the delightful piece... which they are playing at the Albert Hall tonight.
Charming, yes?
What of it? Oh, yes.
I forgot. Music is less in your line than marksmanship.
If you listen, my dear Ramon...
I'll show you the exact moment at which you can shoot.
Now, listen carefully.
There.
You see, at such a moment, your shot will not be heard.
I think the composer would have appreciated that.
No one will know.
Except for one.
Yeah, if you are clever, my friend.
You must start soon. It's impolite to be late for a concert.
And tell Mrs. Lawrence... her little Betty and her husband are very well.
Anything else?
Tell her they may soon be leaving us.
Leaving us for a long, long journey.
How is it that Shakespeare says?
From which no traveler returns."
A great poet.
Daddy! Daddy!
Let me go! Daddy!
Daddy!
Let me go! Daddy!
Was that it?
Sounds as if it went off all right.
I hope so, for all our sakes.
There he goes!
Follow that car. You come with me.
Well?
It's all right.
What was that scream?
We have to apologize to listeners... for the delay which has occurred in the broadcast... of the concert from the Albert Hall.
An attempt has been made to assassinate the distinguished European diplomat...
Monsieur Ropa, who is attending the concert.
Attempt"?
We are happy to say, however, that the shot fired... merely caused a slight flesh wound in Monsieur Ropa's shoulder... and he has been able to return home.
We are now taking listeners back to the Albert Hall... for the rest of the concert, which has already started.
It must have been that damned woman screaming.
Were you followed here?
No one saw me leave the building. I couldn't have been followed.
I hope you are right, for your own sake... and for dear little Betty's.
Call the others.
Abbott wants you. Come on.
Take a look.
Gangway, please. - Gangway, please.
Looks like an all-night job to me.
Baker?
Listen, Baker, I want you to go across to their front door and knock.
Once that door's open, see that it stays open till we get across.
Do you understand?
Yes, sir.
Quick! Come on, boys!
Do you know anything about that house? What about the child?
Any idea if she's inside?
I know no more than you do. God, I hope not.
All I know is they went to Wapping...
What's up?
We've got orders to clear these streets.
I've got orders to clear my box.
Anything further, Binstead?
No, sir.
We can't do anything against them with revolvers. I've sent to try and raise some rifles.
Where from?
There's a gunsmith's a few streets away.
It's the rifles, sir. - Good.
Put the men in the house opposite at the same level.
Get in by the back doors. - Very good, sir.
You take charge of the firing party.
I'll send the men in to you.
And clear the people out of the houses you occupy.
Very good, sir. Where's your backyard?
Through the kitchen. This way.
Sergeant, leave a couple of men next door on the ground floor.
I'll take the rest in here. Come on. Whose rifle's this?
It's mine.
What's the trouble?
You'll have to shift your family out of here.
I ain't married. - All the better for you.
You wait out here. It'll be safer.
We've got business inside.
Much better if you waited outside, you know.
I only come in to see if everything was all right.
Stop that.
This is a scrap, not a smoking concert.
That piano will make a nice rest. Let's move it over.
Come away from that window! You'll get killed! - Oh...
You've got to get out of this room. The police want to come in.
Take your tunics off. Don't touch that blind till you're in position.
When you hear my whistle, open fire.
Yes, sir.
Better take that mattress across. Give you a bit of cover.
I've come straight off point duty. I could do with a bit of sleep on that myself.
Still warm too. - Sure. I'll tell your missus about ya.
Are you ready?
Wait a minute.
There must be some way through to the house.
Try all these doors. - Come on, boys.
Try those doors.
They're locked, sir.
Smash them in. Go on.
Break 'em right down.
They're all in.
It'd be safer if you were farther up the street, madam.
By God, that's done us.
More ammunition wanted.
All right. Get it.
No, I finish. I don't go on.
You took this on for our cause, and you've got to go through with it.
We ought to have taken a chance. We ought to have shot our way out.
I never ordered the first policeman to be shot.
Now we'll have to try and use... the child.
Go and fetch her.
Go and fetch her, yes?
I'll keep her close.
Then if they get me, they get her too.
They're scarcely replying to our fire at all now, sir. My God, look at that!
It's Betty!
Stop them firing.
Quick, get that man.
I might hit the kiddy.
Two men on the roof after the girl.
Sergeant, look after him.
The rest of you, come with me.
Hello, darling.
Come on. You're all right.
Here's Mummy. Look.
It's all right.
It's all right.
How often do I have to tell you... that Sophia Frederica is no longer to play with toys.
She's almost seven now.
Don't smoke in here.
The child is sick.
I work day and night to arrange an advantageous marriage someday, and you undo everything.
How am I to make it clear to you that Sophia might one day become a queen ?
I don't want to be a queen, Mother. I want to be a toe dancer.
Be quiet, Sophia. You're going to marry a king if I have anything to do with it.
Stick out your tongue, Your Highness, and say "ahh."
Ahh.
Not as bad as I thought.
We'll build her a nice harness, and she'll have to wear it for about a year.
Put those toys away.
I don't want to see them again !
You'll grow up to be a tall and beautiful woman.
I must be off on one of my operations.
Don't let them frighten you, darling.
A nice harness" !
What is he, a horse doctor ?
You flatter him.
Our learned medico is going to perform one of his operations with an axe.
He's the public hangman.
Hangman ?
What's a hangman ?
Can I become a hangman someday ?
A hangman is an executioner, the man who takes heads off skillfully.
Sometimes that profession becomes the sport of titles.
I was about to read to you... of Peter the Great and Ivan the Terrible, and other Russian tsars and tsarinas who were hangmen.
Stop walking, August. You make me nervous.
Your Highness!
Your Highness!
Your Highness!
Your Highness, a letter from the king.
Your father wishes to see you at once.
Sit down, my child.
We have been honored with a communication from His Majesty... which concerns you principally.
We, by Divine Grace Frederick, king of Prussia,
have, after a series of negotiations,
decided to honor your family by selecting your daughter,
Sophia Frederica to forthwith set out for Russia...
and there to become the bride of His Serene Highness, Peter Feodorovich,
grandson of Peter the Great, nephew of Her Imperial Majesty,
and heir presumptive to the throne.
Within the week, an emissary will arrive...
to escort your daughter and her mother,
Princess Johanna Elizabeth, to the court at Moscow.
 Please inform her that she is to follow dutifully...
the advice of Her Majesty's ambassador...
and extend to her, as well as to your entire family, my fond greetings and affections.
Grand duchess of Russia ! Not bad for this family.
I wonder what he looks like.
That unimportant detail can be settled when the ambassador gets here.
Come, August, we shall reply to the king at once.
One must strike while the iron's hot. Come with me.
This is the countess Cecilia, a cousin on my mother's side.
and this is her sister, Maria, and this--
Your Highness may now come down.
This is Count Alexei, field marshal of the Russian Army, grand master of the hunt, lord of the chamber and ambassador extraordinary... from Her Divine Majesty, Elizabeth of Russia.
This is my daughter Sophia.
Although for a long time we've heard about your beauty, Your Highness,
I must confess, I was not prepared to see such a vision of loveliness.
Her Majesty instructed me to present a few gifts as evidence of her graciousness.
Come here.
This pipe is for you, Prince August.
These sables are to keep your shoulders warm.
These gloves are to keep your hands warm.
This robe is to keep your feet warm.
These hot-water bottles, to keep Mother warm.
Is it then still so cold in Russia, Your Excellency?
Indeed, Your Highness, the rivers are still frozen, and will be until some time after we've arrived.
Her Majesty also asked me to give you this token of her esteem.
Convey to her my profoundest thanks.
Isn't Her Majesty beautiful ! How long will the journey take ?
If weather permits, we should reach Moscow in seven weeks, where Her Majesty is impatiently awaiting us.
And when does Your Excellency require the journey be begun ?
The day after tomorrow, unless it is the desire of this charming young lady... to leave at once to meet her anxious bridegroom.
Did you bring me a portrait of the grand duke ?
I'm sorry, I did not.
Would you like him to be handsome ?
Isn't he ?
Would you like him to be better looking than all men, tall and gracious ?
Yes, I think I would.
Well, he is all that and more.
He's the handsomest man in the Russian court, tall and formed like a Greek god, a model in fashion and deportment which all of us strive to follow.
Are you eager to see him ?
Yes.
His eyes are like the blue sky, his hair the color of ebony.
He is stronger than a team of oxen, and sleepless because of his desire to receive you in his arms.
And he can also read and write.
So can my daughter. She can cook and sew and make her own bed if she has to.
Can't you, Sophia ?
But I don't like to make my own bed, Mother.
Don't speak unless you're questioned.
You did question me, Mother.
Say good night, and go back to your room and go to sleep.
Good night, Father.
Good night, Sophia.
Good night, Your Excellency.
Good night, my little princess.
Good night, Mother.
Good night.
Good night, Auntie.
Good night.
Good night.
Good night.
Good night.
Good night.
Good night.
Good night.
This is unexpected.
Your daughter is extremely charming... and will be by far the most beautiful woman at Her Majesty's court.
I'd be grateful if you were not to turn her head.
She's been brought up carefully, is unspoilt, and I've taught her not to flirt.
You're going on a far journey, and I may never see you again.
Remember what I've taught you.
Always to be honest and truthful;
to be a faithful wife and a loyal subject of your new country.
Be kind to those who are in your service... and obedient to your husband and superiors, and strive at all times to be worthy of your glorious destiny.
Another day like this, and I'll fall apart.
When I return, I'll complain to the king about the state of his roads.
The roads are bad, aren't they ?
When we reach the border, there will be snow and we shall change to sleds.
Your rooms are ready, Your Royal Highness. Can I show them to you ?
Yes, you may. I'm prepared for the worst.
Is the journey proving too much for you too ?
It could go on forever... if Mother didn't mind.
Be careful with that knife. You'll cut your beautiful hand.
Your hand is beautiful, isn't it ?
Why did you do that ?
Because I've fallen in love with you.
Now you may punish me for my effrontery.
I deserve punishment far more than you do.
We must never do this again. It's disloyal to my future husband.
Disloyal ?
It's treason, and I must be careful in the future, but you must help me by not exciting me with your beautiful eyes.
I told you not to look at me.
What are you two doing ? Don't answer me. I don't want to know.
Sophia,you ought to be ashamed of yourself.
You will instantly follow me to our rooms.
Incidentally, our rooms are beneath all contempt, Your Excellency.
The stables are probably better than the quarters assigned to us.
I'm sorry, Your Highness. If you prefer the stables,
I can arrange to have the horses quartered in your bedroom.
Barbarian !
You're going to sleep in my room tonight.
It is cold. At least you have something to warm you when you get to Moscow;
That is, if your husband isn't completely made of ice.
A basket of fruit with Her Majesty's compliments, and these flowers from the grand duke, who instructed me to ride day and night for a week to be here in time.
Welcome home, Your Excellency.
We've missed you.
So, this is Little Sophie, Sophia Frederica.
Hardly a name for a future empress.
You don't like your name, do you ?
I do, Your Majesty.
You will be called Catherine Alexina, a good Russian name.
We've arranged a special ceremony to receive you into our church.
Haven't we, Simeon ?
Yes, little mother, we've arranged a ceremony.
Come here.
So, this is the mother. You've raised a pretty child.
Your Majesty, I've come to lay at your feet feelings of the deepest gratitude... for the benefactions which your bounty has heaped upon my house, and of which many instances are given me at every step I take into your realms.
Tush, tush! Apretty speech.
What I have done is nothing in comparison with what I shall do.
My own blood is no more dear to me than yours. - Is that the grand duke ?
Shh.
This is the order of St. Catherine. May you both wear it in good health.
Be careful it doesn't scratch you.
Pin this on Catherine.
What do you think of Catherine ?
I can only admire your judgment, Your Majesty.
That's the chancellor. Steals more money in a week than I collect in taxes in a year.
Doctor, come here.
What do you think of my taste in women ?
Looks healthy, doesn't she ?
Just what we need to breed sons for Russia.
With your permission, Your Highness.
How was the journey ? Comfortable ?
Yes, Your Majesty.
Are you happy to be here ?
Yes, Your Majesty.
Are you going to love your new country ?
Yes, Your Majesty.
Do you promise to be a loyal subject ?
Yes, Your Majesty.
Don't make too many new friends, and no intrigue and gossip. I have my hands full now.
Perfect, Your Majesty. She will give us no trouble.
Your Highness.
Someday I'll have every doctor thrown out of the country.
Catherine, before you go to your rooms, is there any wish I can grant you ?
I would like to see the grand duke.
His Imperial Highness, Grand Duke Peter.
That's a fine way to receive your bride ! I suppose you had more important things to do.
I told you to be on time. Go on, kiss each other.
Remember, Catherine, the first child must be a boy.
A fine, bouncing, healthy heir. You understand me, Catherine ?
These are your ladies-in-waiting.
They represent illustrious houses of our most important domains.
Step forward, Natacha.
She is the daughter of Prince Dolgoruki.
Natacha, come here.
This is your mistress of the wardrobe. She has charge of the beds and laces.
I must show her my new invention.
I'm in a hurry. I must witness an execution.
I suggest that you wait in the next room.
Perhaps I shouldn't have lied to you.
Forgive me, won't you ?
His Imperial Highness sent me for his soldiers.
I hope I haven't disturbed you.
That's Countess Varonsoff.
She's always picking up the grand duke's soldiers, which I'm beginning to suspect he leaves intentionally.
Don't bother. Don't bother. Go on with your work.
Doesn't Sophia, I mean, Catherine, look beautiful ?
I always forget the new name.
Just see what's being done to her hair !
That's exactly what I'm looking at.
How's she going to wear the headdress ?
Where is the headdress ?
Where is the headdress ?
Where's the headdress ?
We must make you very beautiful, Catherine, very, very beautiful... so that my nephew will fall in love with you.
I expect you two to behave like love birds so Russia will have an heir to the throne.
Remember, I want a boy, not a girl. Nothing less than a boy will do.
We don't want any more women on the throne.
But Your Majesty, what would we have done if you had been born a boy ?
I would have had less trouble in Russia if I'd been born a man instead of woman.
We women are too much creatures of the heart, aren't we, Catherine ?
Yes, Your Majesty.
Grant them of the fruit of their bodies fair children,
concord of soul and body.
exalt them like the cedars of Lebanon.
like a luxuriant vine, give them seed in number like full ears of grain...
that they may abound in every work that is good and acceptable unto Thee;
and let them behold their children's children like a newly planted olive orchard,
round about their table that obtaining favor in Thy sight, they may shine like the stars of heaven."
Blessed be this bed.
Your Imperial Majesty, before the bridal pair retire, I wish to propose a toast... to Her Imperial Highness, the grand duchess Catherine.
May our new bride from far away be forever happy... and learn to know the love we have in our Russian hearts for her... and the hope this vast, imperishable empire has... for an heir to the throne.
You have made me very happy today, Catherine, and i hope you will continue to make me happy.
Now, I'm going to bed. I'm very tired.
And I know that most of you... are
are also very tired.
May I inquire how Her Imperial Highness deigns to feel this morning ?
Her Highness feels as well as can be expected... after her romantic marriage.
And how is His Excellency ?
His Excellency is distressed because you've been avoiding him for an eternity.
I haven't been avoiding you.
You have.
I've tried again and again to see you alone...
and you've made it impossible. - If you must know,
I haven't had enough time to recover from the shock... of finding my husband a trifle different than you described him.
I had a duty to my country and a loyalty to my sovereign.
Had I described the grand duke correctly, you might not have come here.
I would have obeyed my mother even if you had told the truth.
How could I have known of such a degree of filial respect ?
Anyway, I would have taken no chances, because from the moment I saw you,
I wanted you to come to Russia.
Please, be careful.
My husband will be told. - Your husband doesn't mean a thing to you.
He does.
I'll always be faithful to him.
Those ideas are old-fashioned.
This is the eighteenth century.
But I'm not a Russian. I'm going now.
I told you I wanted to see you alone. I won't wait any longer.
I'll be at the stables tomorrow when you go for your ride.
Maybe I won't care to ride anymore.
I'll be there, and you'd better be there too.
I will not !
Furthermore, I'm going to tell my mother all about you.
One moment more, Your Imperial Highness.
On the reverse side of this miniature is a diamond. Don't lose the diamond.
What are you doing here sneaking around like a ghost ?
I hate my wife.
You hate your wife ?
You've only been married for a week. Why ?
You'll make a fine emperor someday, you idiot !
You can't force a woman to be sweet to you. She's only a child !
Be patient with her. You know our people are waiting for you to raise a family.
They don't care whether you like her.
I don't want her.
I picked her for your wife, and your wife she will remain as long as I live.
Get that into your skull. I don't want to hear any more about it.
Do you understand me ?
Her Majesty is waiting for you in the council chamber.
War with Finland ?
Yes, Your Excellency.
How is Her Majesty ?
The last few days she's turned sour, like milk that's been standing too long.
Your Highness is so happy this morning.
You can't be going to see your husband.
Dear me, my husband !
I'd forgotten I have a husband. No, I'm not going to see my husband.
If Your Highness were not so new to our court, I'd suspect you were going to see your lover.
Lover ?
And what may a lover be ?
A lover's a man, not a husband, who loves you with all his heart and whom you love in return.
But, Marie, that's wicked. Don't tell me that you have a lover !
I wish I had. Here, everyone has a lover, everyone but me.
Oh, Marie, not everyone. Her Exalted Majesty can't possibly have a lover.
What about the young man who's always with her ?
Why do you suppose she leans on him so heavily ? Because she's weak in the knees ?
Oh, how shocking ! If anyone should hear us !
Go on, get my dress.
Your highness won't tell anyone. The empress is a devil when she's angry.
Of course I won't tell anyone, nor do I believe such nonsense.
Neither have I a lover. I'm happy because I'm going to see my mother.
Your mother ?
I thought you knew.
Knew what ?
Your mother left for Germany. Her carriage set out at midnight.
You must be joking.
I'm not joking.
Her Majesty ordered her to return immediately.
But she didn't say good-bye. That's not possible.
Her Majesty's in council. No one's allowed to enter.
No order in this palace is intended for me.
Why did you send my mother away ? What wrong had she done ?
I don't remember sending for you.
I want to know why you sent my mother away.
You presume to question me ?
Who do you think you are, bursting into a conference as though the palace were on fire ?
You want to know why I sent your mother away.
Well, I'll tell you why.
I sent your mother away because she didn't bring you up properly.
I was told you were an obedient, respectful child.
You're nothing of the sort !
Why do you think I had you brought from Germany ? To give you these pearls ?
Or to make you a grand duchess of the Holy Russian Empire ?
I had you brought here to be an obedient wife... and to supply my country with a much-needed heir to the throne.
Take Her Imperial Highness, the grand duchess, and turn her over to my mistress of the robes... with instructions that from this minute on she's to be attached to my personal staff... where I can keep her under my eye, where I can educate her and teach her... what it means to be a Russian wife and how to accept the embraces of a husband... like a Russian wife!
Now, get out, both of you. I have a war on my hands.
Looking for someone ?
Oh, you frightened me.
I've only a minute. I ran away.
I came down to tell you not to wait. I must go now.
Is that all you came to tell me ?
What else is there to tell ?
If you come closer, I'll scream.
It will be easier for you to scream without a straw in your mouth.
Get up ! Get up !
Why are there six places ?
What's the occasion ?
You asked me to arrange a dinner for the French and Austrian ambassadors and their wives.
Tell them to come for breakfast. I never did like these diplomatic functions.
They lead to nothing.
I quite agree, Your Majesty.
Don't any of you think I'm going to eat with a lot of dried-up mummies every night.
Boris, sit down there.
Alexander, sit over there.
You, sit there.
Michael !
Your Majesty.
Catherine.
Take his toys.
Michael, sit there. Paul !
Your Majesty.
Oh, go on. Sit down.
Now, the rest of you get out. Get out ! Get out !
The pig, Your Majesty. - Put it down and don't make so much fuss about it.
The way you handle that pig, you'd think it was the only one in Russia.
The wine, Your Majesty.
Fill the glasses and get out.
What are you pouting for ?
You're not jealous of Paul, are you ?
He isn't jealous of you. You look exhausted, Paul. What's the matter ?
I'm tired. My wife gave birth to a child yesterday.
Boy or girl ?
A boy, beloved empress.
What the wife of a guard can do should certainly be easy for a grand duchess.
Remind me to give you a purse of gold tomorrow. Those of you who have boys, raise your hands.
Exactly what I thought!
A few more like you, and Russia need never worry about her enemies.
What's this, Alexei ?
Sending notes to the grand duchess ?
Do you want me to send you into exile ?
Or shall I tell the grand duchess that you're a notorious heartbreaker... and have broken every woman's heart in this court, including mine ?
You're very flattering, Imperial Majesty, but the note contains nothing of importance.
Then suppose you read it.
We are all very much disturbed over your conduct... and wish you would change your behavior so that Her Majesty might forgive you."
Who else can read here ?
You read it, Catherine.
I know you can read... because my reports say you foolishly spend your time in bed reading books !
We are all very much upset at, uh, uh --
at-- and hope...
you will behave better... so that you may be forgiven by the empress."
Send for the chancellor!
Your Imperial Majesty ?
Read this for me.
You must help me to see you alone again.
You are being watched so closely that all my efforts to meet you... for a few precious seconds are in vain."
So, you're up to your old tricks again !
Right under my nose too. Well, forget about her.
she's reserved for my nephew and being taught how to earn his love first... before wasting her favors on others.
Go back to your dinner. It's the first time you've been of use to me in a year.
As for you, look after my friends and see that they're fed well.
Did you hear what I said ?
Sit down,you fools, or I'll send you to Siberia.
She may be a grand duchess to the rest of the world, but in here she's being taught how to be a Russian wife!
Catherine, where are you ?
Take off my boots !
Go outside and send the others away. Everybody !
I want to be alone tonight.
Her Majesty wishes to be alone tonight.
You wouldn't think that once I had skin like velvet.
Empress, bah !
I haven't even the power to iron out a single wrinkle.
What are you looking at ?
That must be Peter.
Go see if it is, and tell him to come here at once.
Your Imperial Highness, Her Majesty wishes to see you at once.
What the devil do you mean poking holes in my bedroom ?
I wanted to watch my wife.
Watching your wife won't give you an heir to the throne.
The next time I catch you providing my rooms with needless ventilation,
I'll have you flogged.
I'll catch my death of a draft someday ! Go back to your rooms and wait for your wife.
This is your fault.
I had hoped by bringing you to Russia to make a man of that half-wit !
Sorry to intrude, Your Majesty.
I think the grand duke dropped one of his soldiers in here.
Thank you. Good night.
Wait a minute.
Come here.
How long have you been at this court picking up soldiers ?
Two years and a half, Your Majesty.
I fail to recall your exact duties here, Countess Elizabeth.
I'm in charge of entertainment for His Imperial Highness, the grand duke.
Exactly how far is it to your home, Lizzie ?
My ancestral home is in the province of Astrakhan, about two weeks journey from Moscow.
Not as far as I had hoped. His Imperial Highness has been entertained long enough.
Do you understand me ? I don't want to see you around again. Get out.
She won't snoop around here anymore.
I should have thrown her out before I had you brought here.
Come here, Catherine. Sit down.
Haven't you given me trouble enough ?
Are you going to behave like an obedient wife... or must I continue to treat you like a stubborn child?
I don't care what you do with me.
You might change your mind about that.
You're in love with His Excellency, Count Alexei, aren't you ?
No, Your Majesty, I'm not.
I'm not.
It's a good thing you're not.
I wouldn't advise you to become my rival.
Rival ?
What does Your Majesty mean ?
You will find out soon. In the meantime, you can blow out the candles.
Before you retire... you can be of one more service.
Behind my mirror, a concealed passage will lead you down... a flight of stairs to another door.
behind that door you will find someone waiting to come up.
I don't want him to see you, so be careful.
Good night, Your Majesty.
Good night, Catherine.
And you don't need to report for duty until late tomorrow.
Halt!
Who goes there ?
Nobody.
Just a minute, my little hen.
That's not the password. You'd better think up another one.
Come to the guardhouse, and we'll find out who you are.
You're entirely too good-looking to be running around like this.
What are you hiding back there ?
Take your hands off me, you insolent fool !
I'm Catherine, grand duchess of Russia.
Don't take advantage of me. This is my first night on duty.
The grand duchess isn't permitted out at night. Tell me who you are.
I told you who I am.
Oh, come now. Stop joking.
If you're the grand duchess, then I'm the grand duke.
I wish you were !
if i were the grand duke and you were the grand duchess,
I wouldn't let you prowl through the night like this, like a pretty little kitten.
Suppose I didn't want to tell you who I really am. What would happen ?
On a night like this, anything might happen... if I'm fortunate.
Well, Lieutenant, you are fortunate, very... fortunate.
It's ringing !
Three volleys.
It's a boy !
Have you noticed, Your Majesty, how the imperial duckling resembles his father ?
Hush, hush, enough of this.
Now,you keep an eye on him.
I don't want anyone near him unless I know about it, not even his mother.
I had enough trouble getting him.
If he catches cold or sniffles just once,
I'll have you hung by the ears !
If he coughs, I'll have you cut in half!
And if anyone touches him, I'll have you shot !
Your Majesty, I beg of you not to become excited.
You've been ill for weeks. This turmoil will weaken you.
Don't any of you think I'll give you the pleasure of seeing me die !
I'll outlive all of you, you sinister buzzards. All of you !
We've been glad with rejoicing.
Your Imperial Highness !
I suppose you, too, want to congratulate me... as the father of the heir to the throne of Russia.
That was my intention, Your Imperial Highness.
And I bring you the felicitations of my nation... and my own personal congratulations on so glorious an event.
Yes, I know. Tell me about it some other time.
I want to be alone, do you hear ? Get out, all of you !
I'm crammed up to my neck with congratulations !
Get out ! And if you must congratulate someone, congratulate my wife !
May I speak with Her Highness ?
Shh.
The empress joins her people in congratulating Your Highness... on the birth of a male heir to the throne of Russia.
We all hope you will recover quickly... so you may wear this jewel, which Her Majesty is pleased to present to you as a sign... of her most extraordinary joy and satisfaction.
Sit down, ladies. Sit down.
Your Excellency, what can I do for you ?
Will you please ask Her Highness once more...
if she will grant me an audience ?
I'm sorry, Your Excellency, we have orders from Her Highness not even to mention your name to her.
Then perhaps you will convey to Her Highness... that I've been waiting for some time now to congratulate her... on the great historic event of providing our country with a much-needed heir to the throne.
I'm certain that history was far from her mind at the time, Your Excellency.
Her Majesty is very ill, and her days are numbered.
Soon she will be no more, poor soul, and another maniac will become our emperor.
It will be a bad day for Russia, and for me if I live that long.
Why are you telling this to me ?
You know that the grand duke isn't exactly pleased with the present state of affairs.
State of affairs ?
What affairs ?
I haven't had an affair for some time.
I know that the grand duke plans to remove you from court... or worse, as soon as he is in power.
You need have no fear for me.
Now that I've learned how Russia expects me to behave,
I like it here.
And I intend to stay... grand duke or no grand duke !
We all hope you will stay, and I for one, at the risk of my neck, would like to help you.
How could you be of help ?
I control enough of the political machine to carry some weight in a crisis.
I have no wish to share in any petty conspiracy.
Should it become unavoidable, I think I have weapons... that are far more powerful than any political machine.
I'm afraid you don't know Russians, my child.
That's possible, father, But i'm taking lessons as fast as I can.
Right here, gentlemen.
What a lovely target.
You're looking quite well, Catherine, since you provided me with an unexpected addition to the family.
Thank you, Peter. It's nice to see you again.
Come to think of it, I'd like you to meet someone... who's come for an extended visit.
What are you doing here ?
Back to the barracks !
Get out !
Come along, Catherine.
What do you think of this decapitation ?
It would be more amusing if it were real.
Where's your visitor ?
Oh, it's Lizzie.
Is she in charge of your entertainment again ? What will Her Majesty say ?
Her Majesty doesn't know anything about it, and I wouldn't advise you to tell her.
I wouldn't dream of telling the empress.
She has her own system of spies.
Not for the world would I interfere with your pleasures, as long as you don't interfere with mine.
How is Astrakhan, Lizzie ?
Or was it Afghanistan ?
If you're wise, you'll find out for yourself before it's too late !
There are comfortable convents along the way. All you have to do to gain admission... is shave your head.
It's good for the scalp, anyway!
Entirely too many men love my hair, and I have no intention of changing my residence.
Anyway, this country will soon need a new empress. - You may as well know...
Peter's going to marry me when the old bat dies... and as soon as he gets rid of his present wife!
There you are, you old crow. Dead as a doornail at last.
What have you got to say about it ?
Open your mouth if you can.
In another week, it'll be full of ice.
In another month, not a soul will mourn for you.
In another year, you'll be forgotten. Where is all your power ?
It's mine now !
Do you hear me ?
Take it away from me if you can !
It's my turn now !
Who is this officer ?
Orloff, Your Majesty,
Captain in charge of the barracks.
Your Majesty, your visit here is the greatest honor in my life.
I've heard a good deal about you, Captain, from the ladies.
I didn't expect to see you here, Your Excellency.
Why not, Your Majesty ? This is my pet regiment.
You look ravishing.
Now, there's another good-looking soldier.
Come here, Lieutenant. What's your name ?
Dmitri, Your Majesty.
And your duties, Dmitri ?
In charge of the night watch, Your Majesty.
It must be cold at night... sometimes.
Sometimes, Your Majesty.
Anyway, I'm certain you're very efficient, Lieutenant.
Is he, Captain ?
Tell me something about him.
He's very efficient, Your Majesty.
He joined our regiment from the Swedish front, where he fought bravely for about two years.
He's also distinguished himself by exemplary bravery on the Turkish border.
This should have been brought to our attention.
I can't understand why such a brave man hasn't been decorated.
His Excellency doesn't mind.
Not if Her Majesty will tell me why she continues to avoid me.
Her Majesty will tell you tonight... if you will call on her.
With pleasure, Your Majesty.
For bravery in action.
See that you do justice to it in future emergencies.
And now, Captain, tell me something about yourself.
Your Majesty, I'm distressed at my neglect at not having rewarded Lt. Dmitri before.
With your permission, Your Majesty.
Rich too, huh ?
Her Majesty will see you now, Your Excellency.
At last, Your Majesty, I've achieved... the enviable privilege of entering these rooms.
I seem to have a faint recollection that you had that privilege before.
Not since the days of Her Late Majesty, whom I often visited in the capacity of a trusted advisor.
Tell the others I've retired.
Send them away, and come back in here.
Her Majesty wishes to be alone tonight.
You may retire.
Tell me, Alexei, are you still fond of me ?
Yes, Your Majesty, I love you.
But I'm completely bewildered by your attitude towards me.
However, I've become accustomed to regard you... as one of those extraordinary women... who create their own laws and logic.
and now I'm concerned only with your safety.
Is it my safety that concerns you... or the safety of an empress ?
I would give my life if the woman I adore were not so far removed from me in station.
The woman you adore is quite close to you, isn't she ?
Catherine, I love you, worship you.
I asked you here tonight because I want you to do something for me.
I can trust you, can't I ?
We'll always be friends, won't we ?
Yes, Your Majesty. What is it you require ?
Blow out the candles.
Behind the mirror, as you know, there's a flight of stairs.
Down below, someone is waiting to come up.
Will His Excellency be kind enough to open the door for him carefully... so that he can sneak in ?
Her Majesty is waiting for you, Captain.
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.
Will you deliver a message for me, Captain ?
I would be very glad to, sir.
Tell Her Majesty that I quite understand now.
No, never mind. Don't tell her anything.
She'll know.
Yes, sir.
Something for the poor, Your Majesty ?
For the poor, Captain ?
Excellency ?
Quite a haul tonight, father.
Chancellor ?
Elizabeth ?
Your Imperial Majesty, something for the poor ?
That was for me. Now what have you got for the poor ?
There are no poor in Russia ! Get out !
I've had enough of this sanctimonious talk.
Let us drink.
Why doesn't he take up his collections in church ?
To the most charming woman in my empire, my friend, the countess Elizabeth.
Go ask Her Majesty, my wife, why she doesn't join our toast.
His Majesty, the emperor of Russia, wishes me to ask... why Her Majesty refuses to join the toast.
Tell His Majesty that my thirst is not as great as his tonight.
Her Majesty wishes me to convey that her thirst is not as great as his tonight.
Go tell my wife she's a fool.
His Majesty wishes me to inform Her Majesty... that she is a fool.
What is your rank, Orloff?
Captain, Your Majesty.
Well, you're nothing now.
Now get out, both of you, and stay out !
Sit down !
My wife is not to leave the palace.
She's under arrest until further orders.
Am I the emperor of Russia, or am I not ?
We'll issue a proclamation that she died... and ask the people to pray for her.
Hurry, Your Majesty. Everything is ready.
What are you doing here ?
Halt !
Exit Peter III.
Enter Catherine II.
We, soldiers in the service of the Holy Russian Empire, do hereby solemnly swear to acknowledge... and to defend with our lives, the authority of Catherine our empress, and to destroy her enemies !
Hooray !
Hooray !
Hooray !
Your Majesty, we're sorry to trouble you,
But Her Majesty isn't in here, is she ?
She's no longer in her rooms.
You infernal blockhead ! This is the last place in the world she would come to.
Double the guard ! Surround the palace !
Find her and bring her here to me !
God grant you victory, Catherine.
All Russia is waiting for the sound of our bell.
Why are those bells ringing ?
Why are those bells ringing ?
I don't know, Peter.
How dare you address me like that ! Who are you ?
My name is Orloff, and I'm on duty as guard.
I'll have your head for this insolence !
You're addressing the emperor !
There is no emperor.
there is only an empress.
But, Daddy, you all know Michael loves me and I love him.
You can't call that a sin, his feelings for me."
That's where my brother breaks in, Mr. Jacobs.
All right, where is Mr. Johnson?
He's outside taking a smoke.
Joe, go get him, will you?
Everybody be on your toes.
Mr. Jaffe's taking rehearsal today.
All right, skip that part, Miss Plotka.
Go to the place where you hear your father has just killed Michael.
Come on, make your entrance.
Mary Jo, where are you all, Mary Jo?"
What is it, Emmy Lou?"
Your father just met Michael. He's out there on the lawn."
Emmy Lou, what are we going to do?"
You hear a shot.
Two shots, isn't it, Mr. Jacobs?
Yes.
Oh, Lordy, Miss Mary Jo. Your daddy just killed Mr. Michael."
That's where I scream.
There's going to be a lot of screaming around here, young lady...
And it isn't going to be by you, either.
But you said we were just walking through.
I know we were walking through...
All right, go ahead, everybody.
Daddy..."
Now that Hoboken Cinderella isn't going to do.
That kind of acting is for pins in a basement.
You're telling me.
She's hopeless, and the worst of it is that Jaffe's going to blame me...
For the fact that a lingerie model hasn't turned out to be a Bernhardt.
The more you direct her, the worse she gets.
Max, which one of these foul guinea hens is named Lily Garland?
Not so loud, Owen. We're discussing something.
Listen, you foul Corsican, these are orders from on high.
I just encountered Mr. Jaffe in the lobby, all of a twitter.
Is he here?
Yes, he's here... And he wants her pulsing life story trumpeted through the press...
By tomorrow morning. Where is the little baggage?
Who are you talking about?
Lily Garland, you business giant.
There's nobody of that name connected with the organization.
And please, don't come around here when you've been drinking.
It doesn't make for discipline.
Isn't that too bad. Call the roll.
Lily Garland, front and center.
Come on now, fess up. Which one of you pretty witches is named Lily Garland?
Say, what is this wall of silence, a conspiracy?
Maybe you got the name wrong.
Where's the phone?
I can still hear, can't I?
No, the master spoke with his usual clarity.
Hello, Myrtle, put the wizard on the wire. He's in the sanctum.
I'll tell him you wish to speak to him.
I don't wish to be interrupted now, Miss Schultz.
Mr. O'Malley.
I don't want to talk to you now, Owen.
I gave you your orders.
Carry them out. Yes, Lily Garland. She's on the stage.
She is, is she?
Send me down your ouija board and I'll try and get in touch with her.
Can't you carry out your orders?
Say, listen, sire, there's only one blonde roosting on this foul stage.
You, with the legs, what's your name?
Mildred Plotka.
She claims her name is Mildred Plotka. That's her.
I forgot to tell you with all the other things on my mind.
Her old name didn't seem suitable.
I changed it to Lily Garland.
Tell Mr. Jacobs he has exactly three minutes to get everyone assembled.
I'm coming right down.
Yes, sire.
What is it? What's the matter?
Hold your bonnets.
The all-highest is on his way down amid a shower of meteors.
Thank you, child.
Good morning, Mr. Jaffe.
Good morning.
Well, O.J., welcome to our midst.
I don't like anyone chewing gum on the stage, Oliver.
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
Good morning, sir. Sit down, please.
I have been looking forward to this little occasion for some time.
There's no thrill in the world like launching a play.
Watching it come to life little by little.
Seeing the living characters emerge like genii from the bottle.
Now, before we begin...
I want you all to remember one thing.
No matter what I may say...
No matter what I may do on this stage during our work...
I love you all.
The people who have been through my battles with me...
Will bear me out in testifying...
That above everything in the world...
I love the theater...
And the charming people in it.
All right, Oliver, call the rehearsal.
They're all ready.
Thank you, Max, for carrying the ball thus far.
How does it feel to you?
I'd like to talk to you for a minute.
What appears to be on your mind?
I'm afraid Miss Plotka, she isn't going to do.
Miss Plotka? Who is she?
Mary Jo, the lead, your latest discovery.
You mean Lily Garland?
What about her?
Let me explain, O.J. I took a little liberty last night.
I think it was an inspiration.
Another one of your inspirations?
Well, out with it. I happened to run into Francine Anderson...
And we got to chinning about the show and I told her the truth.
It slipped out.
What slipped out?
About Plotka, Garland, being such a disappointment...
Such a washout. And to make a long story short...
I talked Francine into stepping into the part.
You did?
No, don't. Wait a minute, O.J.
So that's what you've been doing behind my back.
Undermining me again.
Listen, O.J. - Francine Anderson.
That piece of human tripe. In my play.
Now, wait a minute.
What do you know about talent?
What do you know about the theater? What do you know about genius?
What do you know about anything, you bookkeeper?
You try to force that palooka down the public's throat...
And you'll find out what I know.
I've had enough of your treachery.
From now on, I close the iron door on you.
Okay. I'll take that job with the Schuberts.
Leave my theatre, you gray rat!
I'm... And don't have that fat wife of yours come around again, pleading for you!
Let the rehearsal begin.
Places.
Act 1. - No.
We will start with Miss Garland's entrance.
That's you all, Mary Jo. Where'll we send the body?
Come on.
I'm at the tiller now, Mr. Jacobs.
Now, don't be nervous, child.
You're not Lily Garland anymore.
You're little Mary Jo Calhoun.
The scent of jasmine...
Is floating through the open window of a summer evening.
You've just kissed your lover goodnight.
You're full of vibrations.
The scene is pure purple...
As you come drifting into this old Southern mansion.
All right.
The door is opened by the old family retainer, Uncle Remus.
Yes, sir.
Just a moment.
That is the way an iceman would enter the house.
Shyly, please.
Try it again.
Daddy."
Just wait, dear.
You're in America now.
Don't you know the Old South does not yodel?
Once more, please.
Daddy.
Hello, Daddy."
Come on, dear child.
You all were talking to somebody on the lawn.
Who was it? "It was Michael, wasn't it?"
Frightened, acting frightened.
It was Michael, Daddy." - "I thought so.
Stanley." - "Where are you all going, Daddy?"
Where's the brother?
Come on, Brother. Downstairs. Throw yourself into the room.
What's all the matter, Daddy?"
Take out your pistol, Father.
Take your sister to her room, son."
Yes, sir."
No, Daddy.
You all don't..."
Just a minute.
Where are you going?
This is like a scrimmage.
Get me some chalk, Mr. Jacobs.
Mr. Jaffe, I'm right, this is the...
I'm sorry. All right, Brother.
I'm terribly sorry.
It's all right, Mary Jo. Where's the chalk?
Get to your respective places.
Now, Mary Jo, I'm going to lay down tracks for you. Here's the door.
Now, when you come on, you stop here and say, "Daddy."
Then over to here.
I'll mark it "two."
Then when you hear your brother coming downstairs...
You come over to here, three...
Then quickly back to here, four.
Then, when your father rushes out...
You won't be knocked down like a ninepin.
Come, we'll start afresh.
You're off the track.
Let's get her a trolley.
Quiet, please.
It's very distracting, that muttering.
Now, Mary Jo, remember what I told you.
Mr. Jaffe.
Who's that?
Excuse me, Mr. Jaffe.
What? This is the combination of the safe.
It's the only copy. Why do you bother me with details like that?
What do I hire you for?
But you...
You hothead.
Go over there, sit somewhere and sit down.
Keep out of my way.
Now, come on, Mary Jo, remember...
Shy but vital.
Give it essence.
Give me the chalk, please.
Brother's all right.
Did you get some more chalk?
Where are you going to get chalk in New York at midnight?
Try the public schools. Borrow some from a teacher.
School has been out for some time now, sire.
No cooperation from anybody.
Never mind.
I'll carry through alone.
Come on, Mary Jo.
Mr. Jaffe, I'm afraid I'm all in.
Nonsense, child. You'll get your second wind in a minute.
Where's Uncle Remus?
Yes, sir. - Father?
Where's your little chum Emmy Lou?
Right here.
Come on, child, get to your place. We're in the sitting room now.
Mary Jo, this time when you hear of Michael's death...
Remember what I told you about the scream.
It comes from here.
Your insides turn to jelly when you hear the news.
And a good long pause after the shot.
Let's proceed.
Where are you all, Mary Jo?"
What is it, Emmy Lou?"
Your father just met Michael. He's out there on the lawn."
Emmy Lou, what are we all going to do?"
One, two, sway.
Stand there swaying.
Come on, Uncle Remus.
Oh, Lordy, Miss Mary Jo.
Your daddy's just killed Mr. Michael."
What was that?
What?
That squeak.
Why, Mr. Jaffe...
We're going to stay in this theater till Miss Garland learns how to scream.
Dismiss the cast.
All right, everybody. 11:00 tomorrow.
I can't stand it. I've done it a thousand times.
You can't hammer at me this way any longer.
Making a fool out of me in front of everybody.
You squalling little amateur.
On your feet. Get up.
Take that hump out of your back.
You're not demonstrating underwear anymore.
I've taken all the bullying from you I'm going to.
No man living can kick me around for eight hours until I can't see straight.
I'm a human being, do you hear?
A human being. Now, Miss Garland...
My name is Plotka.
It's a good name, too, just as good as Jaffe.
I wanted to be an actress, but I won't crawl on my stomach for any man.
You find somebody else.
She's marvelous, just as I thought.
Fire, passion, everything.
The gold is all there, but we must mine it.
Lily Garland, I only heard one thing:
That you want to be an actress.
That's all I want, too.
Look at me.
Duse had that modeling.
Now we're going to teach little Mary Jo how to scream.
Do you trust me, child?
Yes.
I'm going to find the soul that's there and release it...
So it'll fly, soar up to the top gallery.
Oliver. - Yes, O.J.
Go up there.
I want you to listen.
Now, listen, O.J.
Go on. Now, you're going to lift Mr. Webb out of his seat with that scream.
Come on, child. I'll take all the other parts.
Do you want the manuscript?
I slept with that manuscript for six months.
Come on now, dear. Take off your coat. We're going into action.
There are 2,000 people out there.
All the way up, I said, Oliver.
Go on.
We'll go back, so that when we come to the scream, you'll be in the mood.
Now, Emmy Lou comes on.
Mary Jo, where are you, Mary Jo?"
What is it, Emmy Lou?"
Mary Jo, your daddy just met Michael. They're on the lawn."
Emmy Lou, what are we all going to do?"
Remember the pause.
Sway. Keep swaying. Come on, Uncle Remus.
Oh, Lordy, Miss Mary Jo, your daddy's just gone and shot Mr. Michael."
Perfect!
Marvelous!
How was it, Oliver?
Okay from here.
Splendid. Excellent.
Brava. Magnifico.
Great, Lily.
I always knew you'd do it.
It's a smash.
The people are waiting to draw your carriage through the streets.
Where's Mr. Jaffe? - Never mind.
Come on. Make way for Miss Garland there.
But, Owen...
I'll get him.
Say, Mr. Jaffe, it looks like a knockout.
I want to see Mr. Jaffe.
You can't see Mr. Jaffe now. He's busy.
Was I all right?
Was I what you wanted?
I came to pay my respects to a great actress.
Go outside, Sadie.
I came to apologize and be forgiven...
For all those mean things I said during rehearsals, Lily.
Forgive you? Don't talk like that.
Everything they applauded was yours, everything they liked.
I felt it was you out there going through the performance.
That's very generous of you, but the diamond was there.
I merely supplied a little polish.
I'm so happy.
And the scream, was it all right?
I saved the pin as a souvenir.
The sorrows of life are the joys of art.
I suppose you have a lot of engagements this evening?
I was going home and dream about everything that happened tonight.
Tonight's merely the beginning.
You're at the foot of the golden stair.
Lily Garland...
I'm going to take you by this little hand...
Higher and further than any woman of the theater has ever gone before.
The beauty and glamour that were mine for a little while during those rehearsals...
When you thought I was so cruel...
Now belong to the world...
Forever and evermore.
Are you there, Mulligan?
It once hung on Bernhardt's door.
I almost wish it weren't there.
Why?
It's the golden mark that henceforth sets you apart from the world...
Beyond the reach of any one man to have and to hold.
Don't say that. It frightens me.
Would you let me kiss you goodbye?
Yes.
Oscar, don't leave me now. I'm nothing without you.
Where are you going?
It's been ringing 10 minutes. Let it ring.
It's Mr. Jaffe.
He can stand there pushing that bell till he rots.
Remember the last time we tried to keep him out?
He had fits.
Fits.
I'll give him fits.
Plenty of them.
Oscar, I'm going to...
Playing possum?
So Oscar sent you up? - Nothing of the kind.
I wouldn't answer the telephone, so he gets you to carry his messages.
You got it all wrong.
I was passing by and saw your light in the window.
I'll make your dirty work easy.
I'm going out tonight to the Ritz.
You can tell Mr. Jaffe.
The first good time I've had in three years.
Sadie, my chinchilla coat, the one with the silver lining.
And her shepherd's crook, Sadie.
Say, what's the meaning of this, skulking behind barricades?
Did he tell you what the fight was about?
I gathered that in some obscure way...
You destroyed his career.
Get off that bed. It's real lace.
How do you sleep in this contrivance?
Be all right with a pair of oars. Sadie, get me a bottle of gin.
I've only got an hour to live.
I wish that were true.
Owen, I'll tell you exactly what happened.
That Mr. Whatsit of the Mayfair Club called me up...
And told me they were having a Lily Garland night and would I come?
Oscar was right there beside me.
Rowing?
He heard the whole conversation, heard me accept it and never said a word.
I didn't think anything had happened until I got to rehearsal...
And it was "Miss Garland" this and "Miss Garland" that all over the place.
Then he started making those awful faces...
Simply because he doesn't want me to mingle with what he calls riffraff...
And that's everybody in the world except us two.
We just sit here and discuss his genius.
I'm going out tonight and have a look at some plain human beings for once...
And act like one.
I've got a new dress.
The first in three years that doesn't make me look like a Quaker.
Lily. - You, too?
Is he calling out the militia?
Can I speak to you confidentially?
Go easy, warden, she's got a case. Get out, Owen.
This is a question of life or death.
I'll go to my cabin.
Lily, it's up to you. - What is?
I'm afraid for him, Lily.
He's got that look in his eyes.
I don't care what he's got in his eyes.
You don't understand him, Lily.
I don't?
When he's wounded, he's capable of anything.
He's not capable of keeping me from going to the Mayfair Club. Sadie, don't wait up for me.
I'll be late.
It's none of my business, but after all he's done for you, I'd go a little easy.
He made a million dollars off me, if that's what you mean.
And I'm not catering to his senseless, neurotic...
Egomaniac jealousies any longer. I'm no Trilby.
Get out, boys.
O.J., can I speak to you alone?
No.
What time shall I call rehearsal tomorrow?
Tomorrow.
Goodbye, boys.
All right, D'Artagnan.
We'll be lurking on the drawbridge if you need us. Come on, Oliver.
Oscar, I don't want a scene.
I'm all dressed up and I'm going.
Stop making those awful faces.
I'm not doing anything you could possibly object to, Oscar.
I won't have a scene.
You can't bully me.
For three years, I've never done anything, read anything, eaten anything...
Without asking your permission twice.
Never met anybody.
I can't even see my own mother.
That's not love, it's pure tyranny.
Goodbye, Lily.
Oscar.
Our little comedy is ending, just as I always knew it would.
You remember that night you won your spurs...
And we tacked a golden star on your dressing room door...
And I told you, you were not for one man to have and to hold?
Go on, Lily.
Go and dance in that lovely dress at that awful place.
Let them paw the beauty and glamour that is mine...
For a moment.
What are you talking about?
I'm just...
Please.
They're waiting for you. You'll be late.
What are you going to do?
Nothing, while you're here.
New York.
It received me once when I came here, a little farm boy.
It'll receive me again.
I remember on many a winter's eve...
Lily Garland, I haven't finished yet.
Some night when the curtain comes down...
And that little world of yours sits there applauding you, you'll remember me.
You'll know I helped a little.
Goodbye.
Oscar!
You horrible fake.
Be a man.
You're not going to jump out of any window.
Trying to make me believe, you cheap ham.
You can't talk to me like that. You forget who I am.
I'll tell you what you are. A fake.
Go on, jump. Kill yourself.
You washwoman's daughter.
What did you call me?
Soaking yourself in perfume like a hired girl.
Half undressed for other men.
You don't fool me.
Go on, hit me.
I'm not stopping you.
Lily, I wouldn't hurt you for anything in the world.
Do what you want. Go anywhere you want...
Only just love me.
Say you forgive me.
It's all right.
Just don't talk.
Put your arms around me. Just hold me.
What a glorious morning. I'm so happy.
Do you want me to wait for you, sweet?
I don't think so, darling.
You run along and rehearse without me for a couple of hours.
I'm going over the manuscript again, polishing.
Oscar, do you mean to say you're going to trust me to go to the theater alone?
Lily, that's all changed.
I meant every word I said. You'll see.
From now on, I'm not going to be jealous anymore.
When you're like this, I don't want anybody but you.
You know, I've had my lesson, Lily.
Something happened to me last night.
That moment at the window.
A sort of change of soul.
From now on you can go and come as you please...
And no questions asked whatsoever.
I trust you implicitly.
Goodbye, sweet.
Goodbye, my lovely Lily.
Sadie, did you call the car? - Yes, ma'am.
Well, hurry up.
Hello.
Bleeker 82711.
Hello, is this the McGonigle Detective Agency?
Mr. McGonigle speaking.
Who?
How do you do, Mr. Jaffe? Glad to hear from you.
What can I do for you this time?
I have an actress in my employ named Lily Garland.
That's right.
I want her watched, every move, day and night. Her mail...
And can you tap the telephone wires in her apartment?
Yes, Mr. Jaffe.
Tapping telephone wires is our specialty.
These are the telephone reports of all calls.
Forty minutes conversation with the dressmaker...
And never told me anything about it.
The bill is for $1,200.
Send him a check.
Yes, sir.
Good morning.
Why aren't you at rehearsal?
You don't need me every minute.
O.J., just between us, is Lily all right?
I mean, has there been any trouble in the last week or two?
Certainly not. What's the matter?
You've gotten her upset again. I told you not to upset her.
I was just wondering if there was any special reason...
Why she didn't show up at rehearsal today.
She was all right when I left.
She sounded all right to me this morning.
Get her on the phone.
I did talk to her.
There seems to be some interference on her telephone.
I've arranged to have someone go over it from stem to stern.
You've done what?
You see, O.J...
The Vice President of the telephone company is a friend of mine...
And he promised immediate action.
You gray rat.
Mr. Jaffe, Mr. McGonigle is outside. I think something's happened.
Have him come in.
Mr. McGonigle.
Mr. Jaffe, I'm resigning.
I undertook this job in good faith, under the seal of secrecy.
What happened?
She was laying for me in the vestibule.
She jumped out with a stick in her hand just as I was collecting the mail.
Who told her that phone was tapped?
Stay where you are, Judas Iscariot.
McGonigle, did you deny it?
Did you throw the lie in her face?
I stuck with her until she got on the train.
She almost tore my clothes off.
What train?
We had an awful lot of trouble through traffic.
She was in her car and I was following...
Stop babbling.
What train did she take?
The one to Hollywood.
Hollywood? - Yes, sir.
And she told me to tell you that she was through with you forever.
Oliver, did you hear that?
She's left me.
Say the word, O.J., and I'll kill myself.
Gone. Lily.
How could you do it?
I'll go find her.
I'll bring her back, wherever she is. No.
Put me back in the bullring.
Sew me up like a picador's horse.
Blind me eyes.
Let life run over me.
I'm willing to do anything to make amends, O.J.
Mockery.
Take that name off.
Block it out.
Look out, O.J. You'll hurt somebody. We'll have a lawsuit on our hands.
Anathema. Child of Satan.
No more Lily Garland.
Wipe her off the face of the earth, back into oblivion, Lily Garland.
What's Rembrandt up to?
Owen, look.
Oblivion.
Owen, have the evening papers gone to press yet? - In about an hour.
Get out your pencil.
You're in no mood to talk to publications.
Lie down for a while. - Are you still here?
Get out.
I want to make a statement to the press. I have just fired Lily Garland.
I've thrown her out of my theater like a dead rat.
Now take it easy, sire.
What are we going to do, O.J.?
The announcements are up for the opening.
We'll open.
But how?
Do you think I need any Lily Garland to open a show of mine?
There's no actress in town who can hold a candle to her.
There isn't?
I'll show you.
But who? Who, O.J.?
Quiet.
You, come here.
Now listen to me, O.J...
Quiet.
What's your name?
Valerie Whitehouse.
Give Miss Whitehouse Miss Garland's part.
I know it, Mr. Jaffe.
O.J., you're crazy. This girl can't act.
She hasn't had any experience. She's just out of stock.
You remember a little lingerie model named Mildred Plotka...
Who was once on this stage, who couldn't act?
I don't care. I'm not going to let you do this.
You're making a fool of yourself.
Lily Garland's been putting up with all this tripe you've been getting away with.
You amoeba.
It's the truth, whether you know it or not.
Owen, take this creature...
Who came to me as an office boy, as Max Mandlebaum...
And who is now Max Jacobs for some mysterious reason...
And throw him into the street.
You don't have to throw me. I'll go.
By the scruff of the neck. - But I'll tell you something.
Out!
I close the iron door on you.
Okay.
Let the rehearsal begin.
Miss Whitehouse, we'll take your entrance in Act 1.
Oliver, give me some chalk.
Chicago. What a town.
They should never have taken it away from the Indians.
It's a good town for a good show. The World's Fair proved that. Yeah.
Fan dances and flea circuses.
When you came here two years ago with Lily Garland...
The sheriff didn't have to tack a sign on the stage door.
True, my good mignon, but the sheriff has been playing a very important part...
In our last four productions. All right. Okay.
What'd he say?
The sheriff won't listen to reason.
If he doesn't get his money by tomorrow morning, Jaffe don't leave this town.
Kind of tough on Chicago. - "Joan of Arc."
There was absolutely no excuse for that show. I told him so.
He's going to end up in the breadline...
Unless he finds out that these horse operas...
With a lot of people staggering around in foul iron suits ain't entertainment.
Where did you leave Jaffe?
At the Morrison Hotel under the name of Hemingway...
Which he's adopted in his grief.
What are his plans, further than returning tomorrow?
He's going to shoot himself with a gun.
If he gets on that trapeze again, I'm going to hand him the revolver.
He won't kill himself. It'd please too many people.
Give me a double bicarbonate of soda. That's the fifth I've had today.
Oliver, look.
Oblivion.
The biggest thing in pictures.
We could use her.
Four flops in a row since she left. Five.
I blame her for everything.
When she left Jaffe, she took his genius with her.
Do you know how much he paid for long-distance calls to Hollywood last year?
$1,800, and she hung up on him every time.
In some Humpty Dumpty way, that was true love.
Yeah, Romeo and Juliet.
20th Century leaving for New York on Track 6. All aboard.
Say, listen, my fine-feathered friend, you're just wasting your time...
Patrolling this lonely coast.
Mr. Jaffe is not getting on this train.
I'll say he ain't.
I've got four men watching every gate.
He ain't going to leave this state without paying up...
And if you're a smart young fellow...
You'll stop making a nuisance of yourself.
So you're gonna get personal?
I'll cool you off in 17 shades of lavender.
Here, what's going on?
This demigod thinks he's in darkest Russia.
Now, just a minute, Owen.
Who is your immediate superior?
Never mind that.
You see this picture?
The minute I lay eyes on this fellow, Jaffe...
He's going right over to the South Clark Street Police Station.
I beg your pardon, sir. May I trouble you all for a match?
Sure thing, brother.
Thank you.
I'm taking the 20th Century. I hope I ain't late.
No, it's over there.
You can just make it.
Thanks for your courtesy, sir.
That's perfectly all right.
There's no use quarreling with this gentleman. He's only doing his duty.
If he's going to arrest Jaffe, he's going to arrest him.
We can't prevent it.
All right, Oliver.
Goodbye, sir. - Goodbye.
Thank you all for your hospitality, sir.
Come down and have a julep with we all sometime, sir.
I will, thank you.
Very clever, O.J.
You had us both fooled for a minute.
I never thought I should sink so low as to become an actor.
It was humiliating.
Too bad you didn't play Joan of Arc.
Never mind that, Owen.
You've been drinking again.
Go and order lunch.
Tell them to put me by myself at a large table.
How do you suppose I'm going to do that?
The diner's packed.
Tell them it's for me. Go on.
If you want privacy, why don't you travel in a balloon?
O.J., we might as well get it over.
I've got some unpleasant figures here.
Do you know what I was thinking about? On the way to the train?
Nothing morbid, I hope.
That of all my 68 productions...
The most artistic was Joan of Arc.
Yes, it would have been fine if the audience had known what it was all about.
Audience.
I saw the play five times and cried like a baby.
That fire effect was pure genius. I've never done anything better.
Fire effect and all, we're $74,000 and a few pennies in the hole.
Care to look at it?
What a magnificent failure.
If I'm a genius, Oliver, it's because of my failure.
Always remember that.
May I take your bag, sir?
Just keep your hands off my bag and don't bother me.
I don't want to see you again from here to New York City.
Yes, sir.
Repent, for the time is at hand."
Get Flannagan.
Yes, sir.
Listen, O.J.
Don't talk about money matters now, Oliver. Do you mind? I've got to.
The first thing they're going to do tomorrow morning...
Is to land on the Jaffe Theatre with a writ and take it away from you.
And whiskers won't save you.
They wouldn't dare.
Now listen, O.J., there's one way out of this.
Not exactly pleasant, I grant you, but we can't afford to be squeamish.
Now, I had a telegram this morning from little Max Jacobs.
Communicating with Max Jacobs?
Now listen, O.J., I know...
Treachery?
Max Jacobs, that office boy that I fired.
All right, office boy, but he's got a cold million in the bank.
Now, he's produced three straight dramatic smashes in a row...
While you've been laying one bad egg after another. Now that's fact.
I've had enough of your treachery. - Max Jacobs...
Get out!
...is the only man that can save you.
You Judas.
Go to Mandlebaum or whatever his name is.
You're fired.
I know, the iron door. Okay, I've had enough.
Say, Oliver...
And I mean it.
I understand how you feel, but tell me what happened.
I was sitting there reading, when all of a sudden...
I felt something hit my head.
Did you see anybody pass?
No, but when I took off my cap I found this sticker on it.
Repent, for the time is at hand."
Who do you suppose could be doing such a thing?
I don't know, but I've got a pretty good idea.
There's a certain drunk on this train and I'll talk to him.
Come on, Flannagan.
This has gone just far enough. - What's biting you?
We had to wash all those things off with soap and water.
What things?
You don't know anything about it?
What are you yapping about?
You've got one on your hat.
Keep your hands off me.
Is this the same one?
Yeah, it sure is.
Is this an insane asylum?
It's the work of that man who's with you. - Mr. Jaffe?
No, the other one.
I'm going to turn him over to the authorities.
You got a drink?
See here, young man...
Let him alone. I can handle him.
Redskin, me, want firewater. Plenty wampum. Quick.
I paid $12 for that derby.
Why did you paste this?
That's kindergarten stuff.
You'll clean this train with hot water and soap...
And remove all the stickers.
You're screwier than a pretzel. "Repent for the time..."
Are you accusing me of circulating that propaganda?
Somebody just went to the dining room and put stickers on all the windows. - What?
I guess that exonerates Mr. O'Malley.
He won't get away from us this time. Come on.
Did you see him?
Whoever he was, he's pretty smart, sir.
What a trip.
Join Jaffe and see the world.
Don't mention Jaffe's name to me.
What's the matter now?
Same old thing. He doesn't know it yet, but I'm through.
I've let that egomaniac jump up and down on my stomach for the last 16 years...
But this is the end.
Maybe when he's hanging from the rafters with all of Broadway pecking his eyes out...
Maybe he'll realize what I've done for him.
Yeah, maybe.
Englewood.
Owen.
What is it?
Look.
Lily Garland.
Look out, she's getting on.
Look out. Don't let her see you.
All right, hurry up. Get out. Everything's all right.
Oh, another compartment.
I told you to get a room with a bed in it, so I can sleep.
There isn't any bed.
You're a liar. Go ask the conductor.
Just a minute, darling. This moron is driving me crazy.
What's the trouble now?
The company promised me a bed.
Sadie, it's on the train somewhere.
Go on, step on it, Sadie.
Go on, please.
There isn't any bed on the train.
Calling me a liar?
Go on.
I'm sick and tired of this whole trip.
You're mad?
Well, you...
I despise temperament.
George, darling, goodbye. I'm going to miss you so much.
But it isn't goodbye.
I'm not getting off.
I'm going to New York with you.
Darling, don't be silly.
What will people think?
Famous film star smuggles young society man aboard train."
All aboard.
Darling, I'm going to miss you.
Goodbye.
I'm missing you already.
But you needn't, dear. I'm not leaving you.
What are you talking about?
Just what I said.
I'm going with you.
George, we're moving.
I don't care.
The train is moving.
Do as I say.
I will not get off this train!
It's too late now anyway.
This is fine, isn't it?
Go on. Rave on.
I suppose I'm seeing the true you at last.
Fame, success, empty words.
What is therein?
Stop making those awful faces.
Stop acting.
This is going to be a pleasant journey.
George, you annoy me.
Let's tell His Highness they've pitched their wigwam next door.
I'm not talking to him. If I was, I'd tell him something.
About what?
About a million dollars' worth...
If Jaffe and that girl could get together again.
Yes, Russia and Japan might get together, too.
I don't know whether you realize but I've had an influence with her. Me, too.
Once I actually compelled her to admit it looked like rain.
Do you think there's a chance of them getting together?
The quickest way to find out is to ask her.
Not me. Count me out.
Mr. Jaffe fired me once too often.
All right, stay there and pout if you want to.
I still don't see why you wanted to go to New York alone.
George, you've got to believe in me.
Hello, you peculiar witch.
How's the baby Bernhardt?
The foul Corsican himself. Who let you on this train?
Say, if you only knew all the trouble we had getting on this gondola.
Who is we?
Guess.
Holy Moses!
You two mind letting me in on some of these trade secrets?
Mr. O'Malley, Mr. Smith.
How do you do?
I didn't get the name.
Is Oscar Jaffe on this train? You'd better tell me.
Right in there.
The Little Corporal is returning from another Moscow.
His head bloodied but still unbowed. Jaffe?
That's why you didn't want me aboard the train.
Shut up. I didn't know he was here. This is the limit.
Listen to me, Lily. I've got to know it.
Are you going to see this man?
See him?
You think I'm out of my mind?
Thank you for telling me.
I won't step outside this room. He knew I was on this train...
But it's not going to do him any good.
Owen, I'm free from Mr. Jaffe and I'm going to stay free.
What are you all so scared of, Mary Jo?
Scared?
That man's belittled and tortured me for three years.
Ran around telling everybody, "Where would Lily Garland be without the great Jaffe?"
Well, I think I showed him.
Right on top of the ladder and going up.
The lies he told about me and my mom. Called himself my Svengali.
Hello, Lily.
You, too?
Coming back into the fold?
Am I what?
Did Oscar tell you to ask me that?
Lily, don't fly off the handle.
Confidentially, I'm not with Jaffe anymore. Ask Owen.
If that egomaniac were in his grave, the way I feel now...
I'd take a rope and tie it around his neck and take him on a cook's tour.
He's played his last dirty trick on me.
I don't care what you do.
I want to tip you off to something.
Is it all right to talk in front of...
You can get right out now, that's what you can do.
I happen to be calling on Miss Garland.
I want you to listen.
Oscar's broke. They're going to take his theater away.
That's kind of interesting.
They've got him across a barrel.
I'm afraid he's going to do the Dutch act.
Still jumping out of windows?
Old fainting Bertha.
Don't laugh at him, Lily.
If you don't come across for him, it's curtains for him.
You're his only chance.
I would rather drop dead where I'm standing than ever do another play with him.
It might be a smart bet for you.
What?
You go back and tell that fake Svengali I wouldn't wipe my feet on him...
If he were starving, and I hope he is. - That's no way for you to talk.
He made you.
He what?
Get out of here. - You've said enough.
I thought you were a bigger woman, Lily...
But I see I was deeply mistaken. - Get out.
Right outside.
Well, we asked her. Let's tell the earth-shaker.
I thought I told you he fired me for the last time, and I meant it.
Come in.
Are you down, O.J.?
And almost out.
What was the name of the minnesinger who cracked about:
It's always darkest before the dawn?"
I don't know, Owen, but he was an ass.
Did you ever hear of a female entitled Lily Garland?
Don't be humorous, Owen.
O.J., suppose, just hypothetically, of course, that you, Mr. Bromo...
Could get together again with Miss Seltzer.
I wouldn't take that woman back if she and I were the last people in the world...
And the future of the human race depended on it.
Besides, she's 2,000 miles away.
No, she ain't. She's right on this train.
O'Malley, you're a liar.
Okay, but she's right in there.
I wonder if she's doing this deliberately.
I shouldn't think so offhand.
Owen, it's a miracle.
What?
She made the first move being here.
I'll meet her halfway.
I'll make the supreme gesture.
You mean you're going to let Lily work for you again?
How did you guess that?
I'm going to forgive her.
As a matter of fact, sire, we've already broached the subject to her.
What did she say? Tell me everything.
You know her. She screamed like a fishwife.
That's a good sign.
She blew up?
That shows the battery isn't dead.
Did you give her any false idea about her being necessary to me?
Not a word.
Are you sure?
We just talked some good horse sense to her.
That's fine.
Where's Oliver? - You fired him.
He's taking advantage of that, is he?
There are only two musketeers left.
Very well, we'll work all the harder.
I want you to send a wire to Maurice, the florist in Toledo...
And tell him to send every gardenia he has in the shop to Drawing Room...
What's the initial?
B" as in "bughouse."
Drawing Room B, this car.
There's a message I want to go with those gardenias.
Take your pencil out, I'll give it to you.
To my little Madonna of the snows.
No, wait a minute. We won't use that this time.
Put that down, Owen, it's very distracting.
I've got it.
From the grave of someone you loved yesterday.
How's that?
A little on the sad side, isn't it?
It's perfect.
Wish I could get playwrights to write like that.
Can I have a little sip now, O.J.?
So Oliver thought I was through, did he?
It had all the earmarks of a crisis.
That's when I'm at my best, with my back against the wall...
Disaster staring me in the face.
Joan of Arc, The Bride of Bagdad, Desert Love.
No money, no credit. My theater, everything gone.
Everything but the name of Jaffe.
They got me down.
But I'm like a prizefighter who gets up at the count of nine, staggers for a moment...
And then leads with the fury of a wounded lion.
You've seen me in action before. I don't have to tell you.
It's been my privilege several times, sire.
I'm going into action now.
Now don't interrupt us, no matter what happens.
Darling, remember that we love each other.
Who is that?
Who?
That fellow kissing her.
This is the final irony.
Mousing around with boys...
After Oscar Jaffe.
I always knew she'd head for the gutter.
I can't stand it.
My heart's breaking.
Conductor!
Where's the conductor? Conductor!
Come here, you.
Who is that man with Lily?
Who is he? What's his name?
I don't know.
Yes, you do, you Mata Hari.
Is he going to New York with her?
Is that my fault?
Mr. Jaffe.
Did you hear that?
There's a law in this country about riding on trains.
I call on you to invoke it.
What?
Stop the train.
I want that man in Drawing Room B thrown off.
Nobody can stop this train.
Oscar Jaffe's telling you to stop this train.
Oscar Jaffe or no Oscar Jaffe.
Fires, floods, or blizzards...
This is the 20th Century and we get to New York on time.
Now if you'll just go in and relax, you'll feel much better, I'm sure.
Come back here, you. Hold him, Flannagan.
That's not necessary, gentlemen. I'm harmless.
I'm a well-known businessman, Conductor. Here, that's my line:
Sunshine Fruit Tablets. I'm President.
I'll pay for anything I've done.
I'm so ashamed of myself, I can hardly talk.
What's the idea of running around pasting those stickers?
Did I put up many of them?
Why, the place is plastered with them.
Oh, dear.
Is your name Mathew J. Clark?
Yes, sir.
Got a wire here concerning you.
Is it from my nephew?
It's signed Harold Clark.
That's he.
Does it convey the fact that I'm a little crazy but perfectly harmless...
And that he will meet me in Cleveland?
That's right.
It also says that you're in the habit of passing out phony checks...
For large amounts and not to accept any of them.
You nearly caused a panic among the passengers. "The time is at hand."
They got to worrying about a wreck or something.
That's terrible. Don't tell my nephew.
What did you do it for?
I don't know.
It's a sort of spiritual call.
But I'm entirely normal now, and if you'll allow me to go to my room...
I give you my word of honor not to cause you any more trouble.
How are you feeling?
Fine.
Entirely over it. It's quite gone now.
Here, let me pay you for the trouble.
No, we don't want your money, but I'm sorry you've got this disease.
Thank you very much. Let me give you the rest of the stickers.
This whole thing is so humiliating to me.
I just hope we can keep it out of the newspapers.
I'll take care of that. Remember, boys, not a word about this to anybody.
If you'll just go to your drawing room and rest...
I'm sure you'll be well taken care of.
The reason I'm taking you back is on account of your wife.
I see.
No need to have the innocent suffer with the guilty.
I have to change my plan of campaign.
The first thing to do is to get rid of the lover, eliminate him.
Now get out your pencil.
We're going to draw up a contract between Oscar Jaffe and Lily Garland.
O.J., stop chasing rainbows. - Make it out in legal form.
She's going to sign a contract with me before she leaves this train.
Listen, O.J., if you'll allow me to presume.
What now?
Now I know this may cost me my job...
But if you ask me, we're not getting anywhere.
What?
What we need is a play...
Something she can read, see herself walking up and down the stage in.
I'll find a play.
Where?
You can't pull one out of a hat.
I was born under the sign of Sagittarius.
That's the archer.
You draw up that contract.
Wait a minute.
That may be Lily now.
Come in.
Excuse us, please.
That's him.
Maestro.
What is this?
Now run along, we're busy.
Stop that, Oliver.
You know I always see people.
What is it you wish, gentlemen?
Maestro, this is a great honor.
Spit it out.
Maestro, I want to say...
Maestro, perhaps...
You have seen us sometime.
Actors?
We are belonging to the Passion Play.
The Oberammergau players.
Ja.
I should have recognized you.
The Oberammergau Players are the purest branch of the theater.
Oliver, stand up.
Hello, boys.
They are the only true actors we have left.
Not like our cheap Broadway hams.
They are devoted to their art from infancy.
Yeah, I see.
I am the Judas.
He's the Judas and I am...
Yes. Now, how do you boys like the United States?
We don't like it so good.
We have had lots of troubles.
Our manager has run away with all our money.
And now you want to borrow some.
Thank you. Yeah.
You see, we got nothing to eat till we get on the boat.
Moochers? - Ja.
I thought so.
Sit down, gentlemen.
Oliver, it's an inspiration...
At the eleventh hour, with my back against the wall.
How much money do you need, gentlemen?
Give it to them, Oliver. - What?
We don't even know these people.
While you were chatting over here, my mind was active.
The Passion Play: the greatest drama of the ages.
At last I've found something that is worthy of me.
O.J., can I speak to you a moment? Come on, boys. Get out.
O.J., I've got to speak to you alone.
What?
Are you crazy?
Never mind who's crazy.
Go on, boys, I'll attend to you later.
I thought you were going to sign them up.
Of course I'm going to sign them up.
Wait a minute, O.J.
Call them back.
Now, O.J., I'm going to undertake a terrible responsibility.
Now, I know you won't believe me...
But I'm more than just an employee.
I'm the best friend you've got on earth.
Now, go easy, Oliver.
Remember your heart.
I'm not going to let you do it. You've done enough.
I'm not going to let you get mixed up with any phony art.
Now the trouble with you is...
You don't know what's happened to the public in the last three years.
I'll tell you. I know.
I've had my ear to the ground like an Indian.
This is what they want and I'm going to give it to them.
At least we won't have to worry about any goose chase with Lily Garland.
Of course I want it for her.
Why else do you suppose I got it?
The Passion Play?
It fits her like a glove.
What a Magdalene she'll make.
It's a perfect piece of casting.
Wait till I tell her.
Oliver, our troubles are over.
Oh, are they?
Where are you going to get $250,000 to produce a spectacle like that?
By waving your magic wand?
Don't talk about money matters now, Oliver. Do you mind?
I don't care if it kills me.
Is it all right for you to be out here?
Yes, thank you, porter. I'm quite all right.
Yes, but the boys are having an awful time getting those things down.
Porter, have you got any bicarbonate of soda?
Yes, sir.
Get me some in a hurry.
If you are in distress, I have just the thing.
No, thank you.
You're in the theatrical business, aren't you?
I've often thought I'd like to devote myself to the theater.
Would you think there might be a place for me?
Oh, yes.
Probably fill a long-felt want.
That's what I thought.
It might solve my financial difficulties, too.
You know, when one has so much cash lying around...
It becomes a problem how to invest it, don't you think?
I have terrible headaches just thinking of it.
That's too bad.
Why, you haven't taken your tablet yet.
They're really very good.
Thank you.
I manufacture them myself.
That's our ad in the Saturday Evening Post.
This is your ad?
Yes.
We're one of their biggest advertisers.
Well.
And your name is... - Clark.
Mathew J. Clark.
You see, Mr. Clark...
In the theatrical business, there are no headaches.
No?
Oh, no.
Is that so?
George, why haven't you ever asked me to marry you?
What?
I'd no idea that you'd be interested.
George, let's elope.
Why elope?
There's no one stopping us.
Hurry, Owen.
I'm coming.
Come on.
I'm coming.
What is it, sire?
We're before Waterloo with Sheridan 20 miles away...
But we can't wait for that now.
Stand by, Owen.
What's the program, Richelieu?
Where's Oliver?
He's probably hiding. Who can blame him?
Here. Help me out with this. Hurry up.
Tie it back of me.
This is a little bit of strategy...
In case that young ruffian in there gets violent.
Hold yourself in readiness.
What are you going to do?
I have got to break a human heart.
How little you know the real Lily Garland, George.
I've died so often, made love so much on the stage...
That I've lost track of what's real.
What is real?
A house, a home with a little attic and a cookie jar...
And a doorstep, and little feet, pattering up and down.
I thought it was your voice, Lily.
I just came to say hello.
I don't want to talk to you, Oscar.
Please go.
I've nothing to say to you. I don't want to hear anything you've to say.
I'm warning you about bothering Miss Garland, and I mean it.
No violence, George. He'll go.
Let me attend to this.
No. Sit down.
He's got to get out.
A public fight would finish me.
He'd love to splash our names on the front pages.
Let him throw me out, Lily.
It would be the final irony.
I came here out of a gallant mood...
To congratulate you.
And you can get right out again. You've no right here.
No right?
Doesn't he know about us?
I thought everybody knew.
It was one of the great romances of our time.
You...
I broke it in Chicago.
All right, Oscar. You've done your usual slimy trick.
You could never stand to see anything sweet or decent in my life.
You couldn't wait to come in here and blab everything.
I'm proud of every hour that we've spent together.
So should you be. What's happened to you?
Are you trying to hoodwink this child?
I gave you your chance.
Stop!
Don't start hammering at me.
I can't stand it.
Comfort her, sir. It's your privilege.
Lying to me.
Every minute with every breath, lying to me.
Yes. I tried to save you pain. I lied, yes, only to save you.
That's from Sappho.
Get out!
I hate him!
I say it right to his face.
I loathe and despise him. I hate the ground he walks on.
He's part of something horrible in my life.
George, don't leave me with him.
What an exit.
Not a word.
That's what we should have had in The Heart of Kentucky...
When Michael leaves Mary Jo in the first act.
Go and crawl back under your stone or wherever you came from.
I'll be back in a few minutes with a little surprise.
Something I've been promising you for seven years.
Owen, I've just played a scene.
Sardou might have written it.
I have her in the perfect mood, and we must strike at once.
Where's Oliver with that contract?
Let's hurry. Come on.
You're back all ready to forgive me.
No.
I don't care to be forgiven by you.
You won't be. I came for my hat.
Get it and get out.
It happens that you're sitting on it.
Why do people keep hammering at me?
Hammering and hammering...
You're hysterical.
It happens I'm as calm as a fish.
Lying to me. Swearing on your love and honor. You're a fake.
I'm a fake?
What are you laughing at?
I'll tell you. I have lied to you.
What?
All those opera tenors, acrobats, that Italian bicycle rider I told you about.
They're all lies.
The only man in my life...
Was that cavalier in there, Oscar Jaffe.
What are you telling me?
I was completely loyal to him.
Loyal?
He watched me like a hawk.
And you wanted my respect.
Who cares about your respect?
I'm too big to be respected.
Men I've known have understood that.
Men you've known? Jaffe, you mean.
Yes, Jaffe.
He'll tell you what I am: a first-class passenger entitled to privileges.
Oh, an artist.
You're darned tooting I am.
George, you bore me.
Don't worry. It won't be for long.
My last words to you are that I hate you. I despise you.
Now get out of...
Why do they keep hammering at me? Hammering and hammering... - Sadie, I'm all...
Come on.
Give me my makeup. Stop pushing me.
Come on, Owen. We've got to find that.
That eliminates the lover. Come on, Owen.
Get Oliver with that contract.
I'll do my best, sire, but we've crossed the river and I've lost the scent.
Hello, Sadie.
I'm surprised you haven't been around to see me.
Same old rosy cheeks.
Miss Garland is taking a nap.
Poor child.
No one understands her.
Now listen, Sadie. Always take care of her. Promise me that.
She's very delicate. I think I'll sit.
I'm sorry if I woke you up.
Get out of here, Sadie.
He sneaked in through that door.
I know. I'll call you if I need you.
What do you want, scorpion?
If it makes you any happier to call me names, go ahead.
Oscar, you're complete.
The most horrible excuse for a human being that ever walked on two legs.
You've always misunderstood me, Lily.
No matter what I said, if he'd been a lover...
A real man...
He'd have taken you in his arms, he'd have been tender.
Instead of that, he stalked out of the room...
Like a Reverend Henry Davidson in Rain.
Your philosophy of love doesn't interest me, Mr. Jaffe.
I wish I could dismiss it like that, but I can't.
When I love a woman, I'm an Oriental.
It never goes. It never dies.
Phooey.
Love blinded me.
That was the trouble between us as producer and artist.
So that's what it was, was it?
How about your name in electric lights bigger than everybody's...
Your delusion that you were a Shakespeare...
And a Napoleon and a Grand Lama of Tibet all rolled into one.
You're absolutely right.
What?
I'm big enough to admit it.
I never appreciated your real greatness till I lost you.
How small, how cheap, what egotism not to know...
That it was Lily Garland instead of Oscar Jaffe that really mattered.
When you ran around telling people...
That you put chalk marks on the stage so I'd know where to stand...
That you had to teach me to talk, like a parrot.
It was despicable.
I could cut my throat.
If you did, greasepaint would run out of it.
That's the trouble with you, Oscar, with both of us.
We're not people. We're lithographs.
We don't know anything about love unless it's written and rehearsed.
We're only real in between curtains.
Why, Lily, you're crying.
Sure.
I turn on a faucet. It's that sort of scene.
That's the devil of it. - That's the pity of it, you mean.
Those movies you were in, a sacrilege throwing you away on things like that.
When I left that movie house...
I felt some magnificent ruby had been thrown into a platter of lard.
You put yourself back 10 years, but we can mend all that.
You'll be greater than ever, Lily Garland.
Listen, if all this adagio is...
By any chance preliminary to a contract, you can save your breath.
Contract?
What are you talking about?
You'd give anything to get my name on a contract.
I came in here with a dream we both had long ago:
The last step of the golden stair.
The courtesan, the great courtesan role.
Look out. Look out."
What is it this time...
The big drama about Hairpin Annie, the pride of the gashouse?
No, Lily.
This happens to be about the greatest woman of all time.
Just her memory...
Has kept the world weeping for centuries.
The Magdalene.
You mean that play by Sudermann?
Sudermann?
That German hack?
Listen to me. I'm going to put on the Passion Play in New York...
With Lily Garland as the Magdalene.
I've had it up my sleeve all this time, waiting for the right moment.
The wickedest woman of her age...
Sensual, heartless...
But beautiful, corrupting everything she touches...
Running the gamut from the gutter to glory.
Can you see her, Lily?
This little wanton...
Ending up in tears at the foot of the cross.
I'm going to have Judas strangle himself with her hair.
No, wait.
Why not have Judas drink the poison that was intended for me?
Lily, that's an inspiration. Go on, while you're in the creative mood.
I'll tell you how I can see the whole thing.
I can see the Magdalene...
As a woman who was an aristocrat at the beginning...
And after being heartbroken by some man she loved madly and trusted...
She went down...
Down...
Into the depths.
Hating and despising all men. Laughing at them, so cruel, so terrible.
Lily, if this play runs for five years, I won't make a dollar.
You can have all the money. All I want to do is to stagger New York.
A desert scene, with a hundred camels.
And real sand, brought from the Holy Land.
I'm going to have a Babylonian banquet with your slaves around you.
You're covered in emeralds in that scene, from head to foot, and nothing else.
Suddenly you catch sight of your greatest menace...
The soothsayer.
$40 a week.
Nevertheless, you go directly into your snake dance.
It's terrific, but it's nothing compared to the finish, where you stand in rags...
And the Emperor Nero himself offers you half his empire.
You answer him with one of the greatest speeches...
Ever written in the history of literature...
With all the lights pouring down on you...
Transfigured by love and sacrifice.
And the last we see of you is this pathetic little figure...
Selling olives in the...
What's the matter with you?
You're crazy.
What do you mean?
Coming in here with camels and sand from the Holy Land.
You're a scream.
You're gonna put on the Passion Play.
Oh, my heavens!
You haven't $100 to your name.
But I can raise a million, two million.
Yes, and I know how you intend to raise it. Get my name on a contract...
Shake down some new angel on the strength of my reputation.
No, thank you.
I'm through being your meal ticket.
It's a lie.
You've been listening to my enemies.
I listened to Mr. Oliver Webb, who told me some sob story...
That you were gonna commit suicide unless I took pity on you.
Go and commit it!
It would be a blessing to everybody concerned.
What the... Mr. Webb? He is no longer with me.
I fired him for stealing. Shut up. I've had enough of your lies.
I'm offering you a last chance to become immortal.
Thanks. I've decided to stay mortal with a responsible management.
Who?
Max Jacobs.
I can't believe it. - No?
Read the papers tomorrow, then.
Why do you think I left Hollywood?
Max Jacobs. He's a thief, illiterate.
He can hardly write his own name.
He writes it on checks all right, great big checks, too.
So that's what it is, money.
If I jingled $10,000 or $15,000 in front of your nose...
Your mouth would begin to water. You'd start drooling and squealing:
Give me!"
That's right, Oscar.
Now get out before I have the porter throw you off the train.
We'll see who's gonna be thrown off this train. Traveling with a gigolo.
Get off, you fake, you swindler!
Stop that, you cheap little shop girl!
Get out before I call the conductor!
Call the conductor!
I'll tell the world who's a fake. You are!
Get away from me!
I taught you everything you know, even your name!
Lily Garland, I gave you that.
As there's justice in heaven, Mildred Plotka...
You will end up where you belong...
In the burlesque houses.
Get out of here!
You coward.
Who's a coward? You!
Owen.
Where's that scoundrel, Webb?
Selling me out behind my back.
I'll strangle him with these bare hands...
So help me, if I go to the chair for it.
O.J.
Come in, you gray rat.
Do you know who I've got with me?
Mathew J. Clark, the patent medicine king.
I've talked him into financing the play from a religious angle.
You can write your own ticket.
Where is he?
Just outside the door.
Show him in.
Come in, Mr. Clark.
Mr. Jaffe, Mr. Clark.
How do you do, sir?
Mr. Webb has told me all about you and your work.
I'm glad to meet a noble and pious man.
That's very kind of you, sir.
It's unusual to find a man of your profession interested in religion.
What is your denomination?
I'm proud and happy to say, sir, that I am a Baptist.
Will you sit down, please?
You got some more telegraph blanks?
I want to send another one.
To John Ringling.
I'm in the market for 25 camels...
Several elephants, and an ibis.
A what?
That is the royal bird of Egypt.
Give me the rock-bottom price.
And sign it Oscar Jaffe. Right.
Go ahead. Say, O.J...
Where are you gonna house these monsters?
I'm going to construct a small zoo next to the green room.
I wish I knew the name of the Sultan of Turkey.
I don't suppose you know it, do you?
What sort of didos are you casting him for?
I don't want him, you fool. I want his dervishes, the whirling ones.
I want a dozen of them. Now go and get his address.
I'll go and ask the conductor.
Owen, something tells me you're not educated enough for this sort of thing.
I'll have to hire some professor.
Save your dough, sire.
I yield the lamp of learning to no one.
Owen, did you see Lily?
I harped on that check for a half an hour.
Go get her, Owen.
Don't fail me.
I'll bring her if I have to bring her on a stretcher.
Where are you going, Owen?
I'm detouring over the Alps again.
How did you get on, O.J.?
Listen, I want to tell you something.
I don't quite trust that man.
I want you to get off at Cleveland and cash that check...
So I can give Lily her pound of flesh.
Get out your pen so I can endorse it.
I'm not bragging, but I'd just like to point out...
That little Oliver Webb delivers in a pinch.
I'm thinking of promoting you, Oliver. We'll have to get you a secretary...
A little fat one that you can boss around all by yourself.
You're not bad-looking, you know...
If you'd only burn that hat.
Now run along, Oliver, and leave me alone. I'm very busy.
It's outrageous, that's what it is.
But it isn't the conductor's fault.
We were sitting here, and for no reason at all...
This horrible old man rushed in and stuck this sticker on the window.
He's loose again.
Did you see him?
No, sir, he's just up and down with those stickers like a ghost.
Our lives aren't safe with this creature loose.
Don't worry. They're taking him off at Cleveland. We'll be there soon.
I can't find him anywhere.
All right, keep on the job. You take these people...
Into their car and see that they're well taken care of.
Happy days are here again
Happy days are here
Is that a new one?
No, same one. Just had it cleaned and blacked.
Personally, I prefer a derby.
No, I mean the sticker.
Same one.
Say, we're on time, aren't we?
Yes. He's not causing Mr. Jaffe any trouble, is he?
Who?
The gentleman in Drawing Room D.
Mr. Clark? Not at all.
I see you know his name all right.
Do you happen to know where he's hiding?
No, I don't.
Who are you talking about?
Mr. Clark.
I've looked over every inch of this train.
Who's after him?
We're trying to keep it undercover, but it's a pretty sad case all around.
What are you talking about?
Clark. He's the one putting up these stickers.
It's an infamous lie. - I'm not going to argue...
But we caught him red-handed. Here, read this.
If you happen to run into him again, just engage him in conversation...
And don't let on that you know he's crazy.
Don't be frightened because he's perfectly harmless.
Come on, Bob, we'll go through this train with a fine-toothed comb.
I don't know, Owen. Signing another contract with Oscar is like...
Come on. Pull yourself together. Here's the historic quill.
Look out!
You're ruining my negligee.
Owen, it's like jumping off a cliff.
What are you saying? That's not a contract. It's a coronation.
Barrels of rubies, carpets for your pretty feet...
Onyx bathtubs, slews of myrmidons at your beck and call.
No, that's not what I mean.
Come on, sign it now while the sap is flowing.
Wait a minute.
I want to run through it once more.
Has she signed yet?
Not yet, but she's going to.
Listen, we've been fooled.
That fellow, he's a lunatic.
What fellow is that, pal?
Clark, our backer.
Odds bodkins. What are you gonna do?
Me?
I'm gonna get plastered. - You're gonna get plastered?
Give me that.
Now, Oliver, remember your heart.
You know what the doctor said.
Say, what is this?
Just a formality.
We're looking for Mr. Clark.
You got the wrong room.
What kind of a fellow is this man Clark?
Very religious and a little eccentric.
Is anybody in danger?
No, but we want to get him off the train before we leave here.
Yes?
I can't see you now, gentlemen. I'm busy.
What are you doing there?
As it happens, I'm reading the Bible.
It's him.
Get him.
Help!
Owen!
Oliver!
What are you trying to do? Let him go, you fools!
That's Oscar Jaffe.
Owen, they're trying to strangle me.
They can't do that to a theater personality.
All right, I didn't know, Mr. Jaffe.
I'm sure you'll excuse this mistake...
But there's a lunatic on board, I'm sorry to say...
And we're trying to track him down.
A lunatic? - That's rather interesting. - Yes.
A fellow named Clark.
He had Drawing Room J, right in this car.
He's hiding from us and he's given us the slip.
He's harmless. There's nothing to worry about.
Clark?
What Clark?
That's not Mr. Clark, the patent medicine man?
Yes, a sad case.
They've had him away for over a year but he escaped from the asylum.
I hope you'll overlook the inconvenience, sir.
Lily, I've been bamboozled. I didn't...
This is the last time I'm ever gonna speak to you.
Lily, my beloved...
You've almost made a fool out of Lily Garland.
If you ever bother me again, I'll get a gun and shoot you.
Wait a minute.
It's going round.
I'm dizzy. Oliver!
No, crazy, you fake, you lunatic!
I can't stand it.
Open the window.
I'm hot.
I'm going to break down!
Hello, Lily.
Max Jacobs.
Maxie.
My sweetheart. My darling. My angel.
I got a new Somerset Maugham play for you. Just came out by plane.
Sweet, that's divine. It's marvelous.
Come in.
The Black Watch, sire, with their bagpipes.
I suppose you're both drunk. - Drunk or sober, I'm here, ain't I?
O.J., I'm in no mood for a lot of fuzzy lamentations.
I won't keep you long, Owen. Just a few words.
There's nothing more to say.
I've eaten dirt and crawled on my face through the mud till I'm sick.
I got some pride, you know.
That's the final touch: pneumonia.
It's typical of my career that in the great crises of life...
I should stand flanked by two incompetent alcoholics.
What's that?
I'm sorry. I didn't mean for you to see it.
Give me that.
Now you know why I called you.
Please.
Yes, to say goodbye.
Owen, he's got a gun.
He's asleep.
That's just like the Irish.
They always fail you in a pinch.
Listen, you foul Corsican, I've been skinned alive 40 times under your banner.
Cut it out, Owen!
Do you remember the day, not long ago, when I was Oscar Jaffe?
Stop it, please.
My outer office filled with celebrities...
Cabinet ministers.
I ain't hearing a word you say until you put away that fowling piece.
Please let's act like grownups for a change.
Yesterday, Oscar Jaffe, the wizard of Broadway.
Tomorrow, a foolish old pest...
Haunting the theater lobbies on other managers' first nights.
You wouldn't want to see me like that, boys?
You'll remember me...
Whenever you hear that wild sound in the night.
This is screwy.
Stop it. I can't stand any more joking.
You've made a drunkard out of me.
Goodbye...
Pale messenger of death.
Cold passport to the great unknown.
Mr. Jaffe!
Just an act.
He'd keep it up for three weeks if we stuck around.
Hear those banshees.
I don't like that.
Kill himself!
He'll outlive us all.
They always do.
It's a dark night full of unfortunate sounds.
What was that?
He's faking.
Owen.
Oliver.
I've been shot!
He did it, the lunatic.
Excuse me.
Give me that gun.
Where'd he get you?
I don't know.
I'm bleeding.
Lie down. Easy now. Take it easy.
I'll get a doctor. Don't move.
I did it in self-defense. He had the gun and pointed it at me.
It was his life or mine.
Owen, I was aiming at myself.
He grabbed the gun away from me and shot me.
That's the final irony: killed by a lunatic.
Oscar, is there anything we can do?
Nothing.
No prayers.
No, don't talk like that.
They can't hurt you.
You'll be on your feet at the count of nine, you old wounded lion.
I got a doctor. He's coming in.
How is he? Breathing?
Gentlemen, I didn't mean to...
Keep away from him!
Stay put or I'll crack you.
Gentlemen, it was all a mistake.
Don't leave me now, boys.
Never.
Anything in the world you say, I'll do.
Keep them out.
Maestro.
Open up here. Here's the doctor. Here's the doctor.
Hurry, Doctor.
Maestro.
Now you'll have to get out of here.
He's our friend. We have a contract with Mr. Jaffe.
Brighten the corner where you are!
Brighten the corner where you are!
There you are.
So often the case, lots of fright and no damage.
You mean it isn't serious?
Hardly penetrated the surface.
What do you mean? I'm weak.
It must be internal.
This is the worst I've ever been through.
You can go back to bed now. You'll be all right in the morning.
Come on, I'll help you to your drawing room.
Come on. The doc says you're in fine fettle.
Owen, Oliver, I have an inspiration. Overwhelming.
O.J., no more shenanigans. - You got that contract?
She'll sign it this time.
She loves me. I could tell that through her screaming.
I must reach that love somehow, bring her to her senses.
Boys, this is the last thing I'll ever ask of you.
Go on, Owen, tell her I'm dying...
And don't overact.
Stand by. I'll get her Daisy. It's a Jaffe production.
Come on, Oliver, we're going into action.
Here, set that chair, center. Wait a minute, a little bit off-center.
Fix the lights. We're gonna do this like the last act of Camille.
We'll get it exactly, O.J.
Is it hitting me?
How's that?
Perfect.
I can't believe it.
I couldn't believe it either when I heard it. Hurry.
I'll be right there.
Oliver, remember what I told you.
She's coming.
Here he is.
Where is he?
Oscar.
Who's that?
It's Lily.
Bring her to me.
I'm here.
My poor Oscar, speak.
Speak to me.
I'm going to go mad.
The doctor says it's straight through the heart.
Who is that crying?
It's Lily, Lily Garland.
Lily, give me your hand.
Where's your hand?
Why did you do this?
Why did you do this terrible thing?
It was for the best, Lily.
Everyone left... Those that I loved and needed.
It's getting dark.
Don't go for a little while.
Oscar, I did it.
I drove you to it.
Dear, lovely Lily.
No tears.
It wasn't your fault.
I only wish I could have seen you once more.
Held you once.
Oliver.
Yes.
Where's the contract, the last one I drew up with Lily Garland?
Here it is.
Boys, can you still hear me?
Yes.
I want this buried with me on my body...
Next to my heart when it has stopped beating.
No!
Where is she?
Is she still here?
I'm here, beside you.
It's hard to die here...
Between nowhere and nowhere.
I should have waited till I was back in the theater...
Amongst the dust and echoes that I loved.
Oliver.
Yes?
Where's the contract?
Here it is.
Ask her if she'd mind putting her name on it.
Lily, it's his last request.
Yes, give it to me.
Here's a pen.
Sign on the dotted line.
Hurry, while I can still see.
Let me in there. I'm Max Jacobs.
Lily, look out what you're doing.
You're too late, Max Mandlebaum.
D'Artagnan rides again.
I have been looking forward to this little occasion for some time.
There's no thrill in the world like launching a new play.
But I want you to realize one thing.
No matter what I may say...
No matter what I may do on this stage during our work...
I love you all.
Oliver, call the rehearsal.
Act 1. Places, please.
No. We will start with Miss Garland's entrance.
Miss Garland.
Good morning, monsieur.
Now, don't be nervous, child.
You are Betty Anne.
This ragged little thing they found wandering in the cotton fields.
Yes, Oscar.
And Col. Merryweather brings you into this beautiful Southern mansion.
Yes, I know, Oscar.
Places, please!
Make your entrance.
Col. Merryweather, why you all look at me so strange?"
Stop.
Let's do this thing correctly.
You've been in Hollywood too long. I think you've forgotten a lot of things.
Give me the chalk.
I want it distinctly understood...
Now I'll show you how it's done in the theater.
Now when you enter...
You follow this line here and you stop right there.
One, then you come over here...
Here we go again, Oliver.
With Livingstone through darkest Africa.
Oscar, you forget who I am.
You can't talk to me this way!
Everyone else in Hollywood would give their souls to have me!
Oscar, you can't do this to me!
Stall, please.
Ladies and gentlemen... with your kind attention and permission...
I have the honor of presenting to you... one of the most remarkable men in the world.
How remarkable? - He's sweating.
Can you be surprised at that, gentlemen?
Every day he commits to memory 50 new facts... and remembers every one of them.
Facts from history, from geography, from newspapers... from scientific books, millions and millions of them.
Think of the strain involved by his prodigious feat.
His feet ain't half as big as yours, cully.
I'm referring to his feats of memory.
Test him, please.
Ladies and gentlemen, ask him your questions... and he will answer you, fully and freely.
I also add, ladies and gentlemen, before retiring... that Mr. Memory has left his brain to the British Museum.
Hurray!
A question, please. Ladies first.
Where's my old man been since last Saturday?
On the booze!
In quod!
Out with his bit!
A serious question, please.
What won the Derby in 1921?
Mr. Jack Jool's Humorist with Steve Donoghue up.
Won by a length at odds 6 to 1.
Second and third: Craig-an-Eran and Lemonora. - Am I right, sir?
Right.
What won in 1936?
Come back in 1937, and I'll tell you.
How far is Winnipeg from Montreal?
What won the Cup in 1926?
Waterloo, football or tea.
Football, silly.
When did Chelsea win it?
63 B.C. in the presence of Nero.
What causes pip in poultry?
Don't make yourself so common.
Our fowls have it, haven't they?
How many races did Mick the Miller win?
How old is Mae West?
When was Crippen hanged?
Who was the last British heavyweight champion of the world?
Henry VIII!
My old woman!
Bob Fitzsimmons.
He defeated Jim Corbett... heavyweight champion of America at Carson City, Nevada... in October, 1897.
He was 34 years of age.
Am I right, sir?
How old is Mae West?
I know, sir, but I never tell a lady's age.
Next, please.
What causes pip in poultry?
How far is Winnipeg from Montreal?
Miss Winnie Who, sir?
How far is Winnipeg from Montreal?
A gentleman from Canada. You're welcome, sir.
Winnipeg, the third city of Canada and the capital of Manitoba.
Distance from Montreal: 1,424 miles.
Am I right?
Quite right.
How old's Mae West?
How old's Mae West?
Hey, you!
How old's Mae West?
Gentlemen! Please, you're not at home!
Hey, you!
What causes pip in - causes pip in po - po -
Hey, come on!
For God's sake, play something!
Here we are.
May I come home with you?
What's the idea?
I'd like to.
It's your funeral.
Come on, there's a bus.
You don't stay here always?
No, I've taken a furnished flat. I'm only here from Canada for a few months.
By the way, am I allowed to know your name?
Smith.
All right.
Do you want to know more about me?
What do you think I do for a living?
Actress?
Not in the way you mean.
Chorus?
No.
I'm sorry.
I'm a freelance.
Out for adventure, eh?
That's right.
This way.
I'm afraid you'll find my sitting room all upset. I haven't decorated.
Wait till I find the switch.
Not yet.
Now.
Mr. Hannay, would you be kind and turn that mirror to the wall?
You'd be happier if there were curtains over those windows.
Yes.
I'm sorry.
There's the telephone.
Just a minute.
Don't answer the telephone.
Because I think it's for me.
Please don't answer.
Just as you say.
Won't you sit down?
Would you kick that footstool to me?
You needed that.
I did.
Thank you.
I owe you an explanation.
Don't bother about me. - I'm nobody.
We cannot talk here.
All right.
Just a minute.
Okay?
Mm-hmm.
Cigarette?
No, thank you.
There's our friend again.
Take no notice.
Would you think me very troublesome if I asked for something to eat? - I've had nothing all day.
Sure.
You like haddock?
Yes, please.
I suppose your name isn't really Smith.
It depends on where I am.
You may call me Annabella.
Annabella Smith.
A clergyman's daughter, I presume.
Hello. Nervy? Upset by those shots tonight?
I fired those shots.
Yes, to create a diversion.
I had to get away from that theater quickly.
There were two men there who wanted to kill me.
You should be more careful in choosing your gentlemen friends.
You don't understand.
You don't make it easy for me.
Beautiful, mysterious woman pursued by gunmen.
Sounds like a spy story.
That's exactly what it is.
Only I prefer the word agent better.
Agent"? - For what country?
Any country that pays me.
What is your country?
I have no country.
Born in a balloon?
We'll let that go.
I suppose you've come here... to dig up some great big state secret.
I am here to save a secret from being divulged.
A very important secret for this country.
Not because I love England, but because it will pay me better.
Thank you.
The very brilliant agent... of a certain foreign power... is on the point of obtaining a secret vital to your air defense.
I tracked two of his men to that music hall.
Unfortunately, they recognized me. - That's why they're after me now.
That was too bad.
You ever heard of a thing called "persecution mania"?
You don't believe me?
Frankly, I don't.
Go and look down into the street then.
You win.
Are they there?
I'd hoped I'd shaken them off.
I'm going to tell you something which is not very healthy to know.
But now that they have followed me here... you are in it as much as I am.
How do you mean?
Have you ever heard of the 39 Steps? - No.
What's that, a pub?
Never mind.
But what you were laughing at is true.
These men will stop at nothing. I'm the only person who can stop them.
If they are not stopped, it's only a matter of days, perhaps hours...
before the secret is out.
Why don't you phone the police?
Because they wouldn't believe me any more than you did.
If they did, how long do you think it would take to get them going?
These men act quickly.
You don't know how clever their chief is. - Clever and ruthless.
Who is he? What's his name?
He has a dozen names, and he can look like a hundred people.
But one thing he cannot disguise:
Part of his little finger is missing.
If ever you should meet a man with no top joint there... - be very careful, my friend.
Thanks. I'll make a note of it.
Meanwhile, what are you going to do?
First, I'll eat my haddock... then, if you are not going to turn me out onto the street...
have a good night's rest.
You're welcome to my bed.
I'll get a shakedown on the couch.
Anything else I can get you?
A map of Scotland.
Why Scotland?
There's a man in Scotland whom I must visit next if anything is to be done.
Are the 39 Steps in Scotland, by any chance?
Perhaps I'll tell you tomorrow.
Clear out, Hannay.
They'll get you next.
What you were laughing at just now is true.
These men will stop at nothing.
There's a man in Scotland... whom I must visit next if anything is to be done.
It is only a matter of days, perhaps hours... before the secret is out of the country.
The police will not believe me any more than you did.
I tell you, these men act quickly.
Quickly.
Quickly.
Good morning, sir. You're up bright and early this morning.
Could you use a pound note, brother?
What's the catch?
I want to borrow your cap and coat.
What's all this? What's the big idea?
I want to make a getaway.
To a bunk?
Yes.
What have you been up to?
I'll have to trust you.
There's been a murder up on the first floor.
By you?
No, by those two men out there.
I see.
I suppose they're waiting there for a copper to come and arrest them.
It's quite true.
They're spies, foreigners.
They've murdered a woman in my flat, and now they're waiting for me.
Come off it. Funny jokes at 5:00 in the morning.
All right.
I'll tell you the truth.
Are you married?
Yes, but don't rub it in.
What's the idea now?
I'm not.
I'm a bachelor.
A married woman lives on the first floor.
Does she? - Yes.
I've just been paying her a call.
Now I want to go home.
What's preventing you?
One of those men is her brother, the other's her husband. Now do you see?
Why didn't you tell me before? I only wanted to be told.
Trying to keep me with tales about murders and foreigners.
Here, put this on. Put on my hat. There you are.
Take the pound.
No, sir, you're welcome to it.
You'd do the same for me one day.
Lead the pony around the corner.
So long, old sport.
Good-bye.
Oy!
The empties!
Papers, magazines, chocolates, cigarettes.
There he is.
For one thing, they're much prettier than they were 20 years ago. - More free.
Free and easy.
You're right there.
I could never understand how people used to put up with the old-fashioned sort.
All bones and no bend.
The old-fashioned did last longer. - I don't know.
Mine last about a year.
Here, I'll show you.
Big demand for these now.
The old-fashioned sort.
Brrr! My wife.
Now look at these.
Our new Streamline Model Number 1.
Anything go with it?
I should say so.
This.
Put a pretty girl inside those, and she needn't be ashamed of herself.
Bring it back to me when it's filled.
What's this?
Edinburgh, Waverley. We're getting on.
Pardon us for talking business, sir.
Good day, sir.
Good day.
Broad-minded old geezer.
Bet he's very good at charades.
I wonder what won the 2:00 at Windsor.
I don't know. Let's get a paper.
Say, son, speak the English?
Dispatch.
Hello.
What won it?
There's been another woman murdered in a West End flat.
What?
Woman murdered in West End flat."
These sex dramas don't appeal to me. What won?
Bachelor Bud.
Seven to four odds.
Not so good.
Portland Mansions, Portland Place. By the BBC.
That's a nice, quiet place to put someone to sleep.
Good night, everybody."
That's a good one.
What was she like?
One of the usual?
A well-dressed woman of about 35 with a knife in her back.
The tenant, Richard Hannay, is missing."
You surprise me.
At 7:00 this morning, the charwoman, Elizabeth Briggs -"
If that isn't the blasted limit.
What's the matter now?
Is there no honesty in this world?
I ask you. "The new Bodyline rubber panty corset.
On sale today.
McCutcheon Brothers, Princess Street.
Price: 17 and 9.
Brassiere to match: 4 and 11." You get that?
The Bodyline.
One and three cheaper than our Streamline.
No use going to Aberdeen now.
Might I have a look at your paper?
Thank you.
There's enough evidence there to hang any man.
What can I do for you, sir?
Can you tell me what station the train stops at next?
Do you think I'm a railway porter?
Go find out for yourself.
I can tell a better one than that. - You couldn't.
That was very funny.
You liked it?
Have you heard the one about the young lady of Bulgar?
I can't remember them all.
You must hear that.
There was a young lady of Bulgar.
Taking tea, sir?
Yes. Thank you.
Darling, how lovely to see you!
Young man having a free meal in there.
I was desperate. I'm terribly sorry. I had to do it.
My name's Hannay. They're after me. I swear I'm innocent.
You've got to help me. I've got to keep free for the next few days.
Have you seen a man pass in the last few minutes?
This is the man you want, I think.
But when we passed just now -
He told me his name was Hannay.
Is your name Hannay?
Are you coming into tea, sir?
I'll be right along.
Pull that cord!
Stay away. Go on, men.
Go down there.
Get on with it.
Why did you pull the communication cord?
To stop the train, you old fool.
It's against all the regulations... - to stop the train on the bridge.
A man jumped out. He's a murderer.
We've got to take him.
Which way did he go?
He must have jumped off here.
I can't see him.
Are you sure he jumped?
I cannot wait here any longer!
There he is, getting on the train.
No, that's a passenger.
It's him, I tell you!
Come on, then.
Hannay escapes! Paper! - Hannay escapes!
Paper! Extra special!
Hannay escapes from police! Paper!
Height: about five foot ten.
Small moustache.
Last seen wearing a dark suit... but he may have obtained a change of clothing.
Good day.
And to you.
What'll your business be?
I'm a motor mechanic looking for a job.
You'll find no work here.
Are there no big houses around here?
Only Sir Andrews. He won't be wanting you.
He's had the same chauffeur for 40 years.
I didn't know there had been cars that long.
He was coachman besides when he was a boy.
I see.
What's that?
That's the manse.
But the minister has no motorcar.
Are there no newcomers?
There's an Englishman, a professor.
A professor?
He lives in Alt-na-Shellach.
Where?
On the other side of the loch.
Would that be near that village?
It would.
Thanks.
I'll try there.
You won't try tonight.
It's 14 miles.
Could I get a lift in that van?
No, it's going the other way.
I guess you're right.
Could you put me up for the night?
Free?
No, I'll pay.
All right.
Can you eat herring?
I could eat a half dozen right now.
Can you sleep in a box bed?
I can try.
Two and six.
Take it now. Thank you.
Go in with the gentleman.
He'll stay with us till tomorrow morning.
Your daughter?
My wife.
Will you now come in?
Thank you.
Here's your bed.
I'll lift these things.
Could you sleep there?
You try and stop me.
You'll be tired.
I'll say I am.
I'm on the tramp, looking for a job.
Won't you sit down while I go on with our supper?
Thank you.
Have you been in these parts long?
No, I'm from Glasgow.
Did you ever see it?
No.
You should see Sauchiohall Street with all its fine shops... and Argyll Street on a Saturday night... with the trams and the lights... and the cinema palaces and their crowds.
And it's Saturday night tonight.
You certainly don't get those things out here.
No.
You miss them?
Sometimes.
I've never been to Glasgow, but I've been to Edinburgh... and Montreal and London.
I'll tell you all about London at supper.
John wouldn't approve of that.
Why not?
He says it's best not to think of such places and the wickedness there.
Why not listen now before he comes back?
What do you want to know?
Is it true that all the ladies paint their toenails?
Some of them.
Do London ladies look beautiful?
They do.
But they wouldn't if you were beside them.
You ought not say that.
What ought he not to say?
I was saying I prefer living in town than the country.
God made the country.
Is the supper ready, woman?
Aye.
Do you mind if I look at your paper?
I don't mind.
You did not tell me your name.
Well, Mr. Hammond, if you'll put down that paper, I'll say a blessing.
Of course.
Sanctify these bounteous masses to us miserable sinners.
O Lord, make us truly thankful... for them and for all Thy manifold blessings.
Continually turn our hearts... from wickedness... and from worldly things... unto Thee.
Amen.
I forgot to lock the barn.
There are cars coming. It'll be the police. You best be going.
Thank you. I was having a grand sleep.
Don't let them catch you. All right.
I'll never forget you for doing this for me.
Which way do I go?
I'll show you.
Aye. I might have known.
Making love behind my back.
Get out. You too.
Just a minute -
Get out of my house before I -
Aye. Go.
And leave you like this?
It's your chance at liberty.
You don't understand.
You're all wrong about this. She was only trying to help me.
Aye, to bring shame and disgrace upon my house.
She was helping me to escape from the police.
Yes, they're after me for murder.
What? - They're here.
She was only warning me.
I had to tell her last night.
Don't let them in. Say I'm not here.
I'll make it worth your while.
How much? - Five pounds.
Have you got that much?
Give it to me.
After they've gone.
Get back into bed. Shut him in. Hide him.
Not there. I do not trust him. - But he took the money.
He could not resist it.
Here.
Have you seen a stranger about here?
I was right.
He's asking if there's a reward if you get catched.
He'll argue about it for a moment longer before he lets them in. Now's your time.
Your jacket's terrible light-colored. I'm a-feared they'll see you.
You best take this one.
Is this your husband's coat?
His Sunday best one, but never mind.
They must not see you.
What will happen to you?
I'll say I couldn't stop you.
He'll not ill treat you?
He'll pray at me, but no more. - What's your name?
Margaret.
Good-bye, Margaret. I'll never forget you for this.
There he goes!
Spread out in a line.
Is the master in?
What name should I say, sir?
He wouldn't know my name. Ask if he knows Miss Annabella Smith.
Would you wait here while I inquire?
We'd better make inquiries here.
Somebody may have seen him through the windows.
There's been a couple motorcars here.
Murderers do not make calls in motorcars.
Good day, dear.
The same to you.
Have you seen any strangers this morning?
There's a few callers upstairs now, but they're not strangers.
You haven't seen any suspicious-Iooking bodies outside the windows... - or calling at the house?
No, sir.
There hasn't been anybody near here for the last half hour.
You're from Annabella Smith?
We're just having a few drinks to celebrate my daughter's birthday.
Give me five minutes, then we can talk. - Of course. - Come meet my wife.
Louisa, my dear.
I've another guest for you. This is Mr. -
I forgot to ask your name.
Hammond.
He's come to see me on business, all the way from London.
There's a police inspector at the door. He wants to speak to you.
At the door?
All right. I'll deal with it.
Take him in, my dear.
Come and meet my daughters. - This is Patricia.
How do you do?
Mrs. Bailey. Mrs. Hutchins.
Hilary, my dear, this is Mr. Hammond.
He just arrived from London.
How do you do?
Forgive the orgy.
We've been to church and the sermon lasted 45 minutes.
This is Captain and Mrs. Ogilvey. - How do you do?
Have a drink? - Thank you.
This is Derek Stewart.
And this is Sheriff Watson.
You've got to be polite to him.
He's our Sheriff Substitute.
Scotch for a local beat.
He'll give you six months hard as soon as look at you.
It's all right. Don't worry. I've sent them away.
Come and look at the view from this window.
We're rather proud of it.
When will you catch that murderer?
What murderer?
The man that stuck a carving knife into that woman last week.
He's here in the district.
How exciting. Where?
Somewhere about. He's been on the moors.
Sheriff Ames, why don't you catch him?
You wouldn't like me to be stuck in the back with a carving knife.
It's no business of mine to catch him. You catch him, and I'll convict him.
Is there a reward?
It's nearly 1:00.
We must leave. - The professor wants his lunch.
There's no hurry, my dear.
Still, if you must go - Pat, ring for Captain Ogilvey's car.
Whenever you catch him, you'll find me at the Sherif Court every morning. - Bring him along.
Louisa, if you'll excuse us...
Mr. Hammond and I want to have a chat before lunch.
Now, Mr. Hannay
I suppose it's safe to call you by your real name now.
What about our mutual friend, Annabella?
She's been murdered.
Murdered"?
The Portland Mansions affair.
Why our friends outside are looking for you.
I didn't do it.
Of course you didn't.
But why come all this way to Scotland to tell me?
I believe she was coming to see you about some Air Ministry secret.
She was killed by a foreign agent who was interested too.
Did she tell you what he looked like?
There wasn't time. One thing:
Part of his little finger was missing.
Which one?
This one, I think.
Sure it wasn't this one?
Lunch is ready, dear.
I'm coming right away.
I've been guilty of leading you down the garden path.
Or should it be up? I never can remember.
It seems to be the wrong garden, all right.
What are we going to do?
That's just the point.
What are we going to do about it?
I live here as a respectable citizen.
You must realize that my whole existence would be jeopardized... if it became known that I'm not what I seem.
Mr. Hannay, why have you come here?
Why have you forced me into this difficult position?
I can't lock you up in a room or anything like that.
There's my wife and daughters to think of.
I don't know what to think.
Really, I don't.
Making it doubly important that I shouldn't let you go is...
I'm about to convey some very vital information out of the country.
Yes, I've got it.
Poor Annabella would have been too late.
That's fair. - Yes.
What about it?
What about what?
Yourself.
It seems there's only one way out.
What's that?
Supposing I left you alone with this revolver?
Tomorrow's newspapers would announce that the Portland Place murderer...
had taken his own life.
I thought you were coming directly. We've all been waiting.
Will Mr. Hammond be staying?
I don't think so, dear.
Well, what do you think, Mr. Hannay?
I'm afraid you leave me no alternative.
I cannot find my hymn book.
Where did you leave it?
In the breast pocket of my overcoat. It was hanging here.
I'm afraid I gave it to that gentleman who was staying here that night.
Cigarette cases, yes, but I've never seen it happen to a hymn book before.
And this bullet stuck among the hymns, eh?
I'm not surprised. Some of those hymns are terrible hard to get through.
I've stuck in them myself before now.
I'm not complaining, Sheriff. "Hymns that have helped me."
That's a good one! That's fine.
And to think I was drinking his champagne only half an hour before.
It's a lesson to us all: not to mix with doubtful company on the Sabbath.
And how did you escape?
If you look through the window, you'll see.
They put the body in the dressing room.
When I came to, I borrowed this suit and pinched his car.
I don't want to hurry you, but shouldn't we take steps? This is serious.
Otherwise, I wouldn't put myself in your hands...
with a murder charge hanging over me.
Never heed the murder.
You'll be able to convince Scotland Yard of your innocence... as easily as you've convinced me.
I'll need a short statement I can forward to the proper authority.
I have someone coming from the police station to take it down.
Thank you.
Are you wishing to see me?
Indeed, I am.
Do you think I enjoy playing for time with a murderer?
Murderer"? - Certainly.
You're under arrest on the charge of willful murder... of a woman unknown in Portland Mansions, London on Tuesday last.
Take him over to the county jail.
Every word of my story is true.
We are not so daft in Scotland as some smart Londoners may think.
Do you think I believed your cock-and-bull story about the professor? He's my best friend in the district. Get me Professor Jordan.
If the professor didn't shoot me, where did that bullet come from?
That's easy. From one of your pursuers on the moor. - Isn't that so, Inspector?
I had a shot at him myself.
I demand you allow me to telephone the High Commissioner for Canada in London.
You better do that from London. You'll be there soon enough.
It'll save you the cost of a trunk call.
That's the professor's car.
Hannay must be inside spilling the beans.
Stop him!
My God!
How do you do? We're all waiting for you.
Pamela's gone to meet you at the station. This way.
Leader and standard-bearer himself.
I welcome this opportunity of discussing with you... another question vital to the import of our country... at this critical and momentous hour.
But first of all, as a preliminary to this... - I shall occupy your time -
You've occupied too much time already!
We've had enough of you!
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm now going to call upon the speaker of the evening.
Speak up!
There's no need to say who he is... or to speak of his brilliant record as a soldier and a statesman.
He's a son of Scotland who has crossed the border and conquered England.
He is now one of the foremost figures... in the diplomatic political world in the great city of London.
I'm, therefore, going to ask him to tell you something -
How important it is... to this constituency that at this crucial by-election... our candidate should be returned by an adequate majority.
I now ask for Captain Fraser.
Ladies and gentlemen, I apologize for my hesitation in rising just now... but I'd entirely failed while listening... to the chairman's flattering description of the next speaker... to realize he was talking about me.
As for you, may I say from the bottom of my heart... and with the utmost sincerity... how delighted and relieved I am to find myself... in your presence at this moment.
Delighted because of your friendly reception... relieved because so long as I stand on this platform...
I am delivered from the cares and anxieties... which must always be the lot of a man in my position.
When I journeyed up to Scotland a few days ago... traveling on the Highland Express over that magnificent Forth Bridge... that monument to Scottish engineering and Scottish muscle -
That is to say, on that journey I had no idea that in a few days time...
I should find myself addressing an important political meeting.
I had planned a very different program for myself. A very different program.
You'd be for the moors to shoot something. Or somebody.
I'm a rotten shot.
Anyhow, I little thought I should be speaking tonight... in support of that brilliant, young statesman.
That rising -
The gentleman on my right... already known among you as one destined to make... no uncertain mark in politics.
In other words, your future member of Parliament... your candidate, Mr. -
McCrocodile.
He doesn't know the candidate's name.
I know your candidate will forgive my referring to him... by the friendly nickname by which he's already known... in anticipation, mark you... at Westminster.
Now, ladies and gentlemen, we'll discuss some topic. What shall it be?
The herring fisheries!
Unemployment!
What about the idle rich?
That's an old-fashioned topic... especially for me because I'm not rich and I've never been idle.
I've been pretty busy all my life, and I expect to be much busier soon.
Have you ever worked with your hands?
Indeed I have.
I've known what it is to feel lonely and helpless... and have the whole world against me.
Those are things that no man or woman ought to feel.
I ask your candidate... and all those who love their fellowmen... to set themselves resolutely to make this world a happier place to live in.
A world where no nation plots against nation... where no neighbor plots against neighbor... where there is no persecution or hunting down... where everybody gets a square deal and a sporting chance... and where people try to help and not to hinder.
A world from which suspicion and cruelty... and fear have been forever banished.
That is the sort of world I want! Is that the sort of world you want?
That's all I have to say.
I kept them going as long as I could.
You're a difficult man to follow.
I suppose you think you've been damn clever.
Tell your prisoner not to insult me. - Try and stop me.
Come along with me.
I was speaking the truth. You must have seen I was genuine.
Whether you believe me or not, will you put a telephone call through... to High Commissioner for Canada in London?
Tell him an important secret - - That will do now.
An important secret is being taken out of this country by a foreign agent.
I can't do anything myself because of this fool of a detective.
Has that penetrated? - Right to the funny bone.
Now tell me another one.
Haven't you any sense at all?
Put that call through! I beg of you! Refer them to me.
Will you do this?
Good night.
I beg pardon, miss, but we should like you to come too. - Whatever for?
To identify the prisoner formally.
Will you come to the police station? - What?
It's only for a few minutes.
If it's necessary, let's get it over.
Now you.
Must I sit next to this man?
It's only for a short time.
Be as quick as you can.
All right.
Isn't that the police station? We're running past it.
Tell the man.
You must have misunderstood me.
We're not exactly going to this police station.
Where are we going?
To Inverary.
Yes, miss.
This man is to be questioned by the Sheriff Principal. - We have orders to take him there.
You have no orders to take me.
No, miss, but I'm afraid you must go.
I'll see you're sent back as early as possible.
How far is it to Inverary? - Forty miles.
Keep quiet.
Sorry.
We'll be there in less than two hours.
I'm spending half the night with you?
It looks like it.
Isn't the man going the wrong way?
Surely that's the way to Inverary.
There's a bridge fallen down on that road. We shall have to go around. The man knows the way.
Might I see your warrant?
Shut your mouth.
You'll see it soon.
Would you like to have a small bet with me, Pamela?
All right, I'll have it with you, Sherlock.
I'll lay you 100 to 1 that your Sheriff Principal... has the top joint of his little finger missing.
What about it?
I win.
What are we stopping for?
It's a whole flock of detectives.
They're all over the road. Get out and clear them away.
What about him?
I'll soon fix that.
Now you're a Special Constable.
What's the idea?
As long as you stay, he stays.
Yes, and as long as I go, you go. Come on.
Stop them! They got away!
Come on. - I won't!
Won't you?
You're hurting me.
Shut up.
See if they've gone down that way.
Where could they have gone?
Help!
Let me go!
One yip out of you, and I'll shoot you first and myself after.
There's nobody down here, I tell you.
Come up here, blast you, and don't waste any more time.
Spread out and find them.
They must be a mile away by now.
Don't do that.
Do stop whistling.
You can't possibly escape. What chance have you got tied to me?
That question's for your husband.
I'll admit you're the white man's burden.
I know, and I can't tell you what comfort that thought gives me.
What's the use of this? Those policemen will get you as soon as it's daylight.
They may get me, but they're not policemen.
When did you find that out?
You found that out yourself.
I should never have known that was the wrong road to Inverary.
They were taking us to their boss, and God help us if they ever catch us again.
You're still sticking to your penny novelette spy story.
There are 20 million women in this island, and I'm chained to you.
Listen, once more. I'm telling you the truth.
I told you once in the train.
I tried to tell you after the election meeting.
I'm telling you now for the third time.
There's a conspiracy against this island and we're the only ones who can stop it.
Think what you've seen happen right under your very nose.
The gallant knight to the rescue.
All right, then I'm just a plain, common murderer... who stabbed an innocent, defenseless woman in the back not four days ago.
How do you come out over that?
I don't know how innocent you may be... but you're a woman, you're defenseless, and you're alone... on a desolate moor in the dark, manacled to a murderer... who'd stop at nothing to get you off his hands.
If that's the situation you prefer, have it, my lovely, and welcome.
I'm not afraid of -
For all you know, I may murder a woman a week.
So listen to a bit of advice.
Do every single thing I tell you to do, and do it quick.
You big bully.
I like your pluck.
Come on.
We're going in there. - What for?
That's my business.
Remember what I said: the civil tongue or else.
We're going in there, and you'll back me up on everything I say or do.
Has that penetrated the ivory dome?
Only just.
Pull yourself together. Put your hand in my pocket and look in a hurry.
Come along.
Come in.
The young lady's terrible wet.
We had an accident with our car a few miles back.
You'll be staying the night?
Yes.
We've just the one room left with the one bed in it.
But you'll not be minding that.
No, quite the reverse.
You're man and wife, I suppose?
Yes.
Have you any luggage?
We left that behind in the car.
Maybe I could lend the young lady a nightgown.
Will you please to register?
James, the book. - Aye.
I'll light the fire for you.
Will you be needing supper? - No, thank you.
Just a whiskey and soda and a few sandwiches.
And a glass of milk.
Very well, sir.
Can't write with my left hand, but I can shoot with it. You can guess what's in this pocket.
You sign, darling.
The sooner you get used to your new name, the better.
Off we go. "Mr. and Mrs. Henry Hopkinson, The Hollyhocks, Hammersmith."
I'll be back in a minute, chaps.
Off with that wet skirt, and I'll have it dried in the kitchen. Don't bother.
It'll dry in front of the fire just as well.
Thanks all the same.
No doubt the gentleman will take care of you.
Good night, sir. Good night, ma'am.
Good night.
Is he married to her, do you think?
I do not care.
They are so terrible in love with each other.
I'm going to tell them the whole story.
You want to hang me for a murder I never committed?
As long as they hang you, I don't care whether you committed it or not. Let me go!
Do you think I'm going to spend the night with you?
Of course. What else can you do?
Can I come in?
Come here.
Come in.
We were just getting warm before the fire.
I can see that.
I thought you'd like this in your bed. Thank you very much.
You'd like a hot water bottle, wouldn't you?
Say yes, darling.
Yes, darling.
Very well.
Please don't go.
Why not?
Is anything wrong?
Of course there's nothing wrong. She just wants to tell you something.
We're a runaway couple.
I knew it. They're after you?
You won't give us away, will you?
Of course we will not give you up.
A good night to you both.
You'll not be disturbed.
Thank God for a bite to eat.
There you are.
What's the next item on the program?
Get these things off.
Right.
Anything in that bag of yours that will help?
A pair of scissors or a hairpin?
Do you think a nail file would help? Easily.
It'll take about ten years, but we can try it.
Let's make ourselves comfortable.
What about that skirt of yours?
It's still pretty damp.
I don't want to be tied to a pneumonia case on top of everything else.
Take it off. I don't mind.
I'll keep it on, thank you.
And that is that.
My shoes and stockings are soaked. I think I'll take them off.
That's the first sensible thing I've heard you say.
Can I be of any assistance?
No, thank you.
Sorry.
Hold this.
Yeah.
Half a minute.
Don't mention it.
Do you like your milk now?
No, thank you. I'll wait a little.
All right.
Cheerio.
That's better.
Are your feet quite warm again? - Yes, thanks.
Come on.
Will you kindly place yourself on the operating table?
Nobody's gonna hurt you. This is Armistice Day.
Let's get some rest while we can.
I'm not going to lie on this bed.
So long as you're chained to me, you'll lie wherever I lie. - We're the Siamese twins.
Don't gloat.
Do you think I'm looking forward to waking up in the morning... and seeing your face beside me, unwashed and shiny?
What a sight you'll be. Give me that nail file.
Let's have a go at this.
Thank you.
There I go again. I wish I could get that damn tune out of my head. I wonder where I heard it.
You sound very sleepy.
Sleepy? I'll say so.
Do you know when I last slept in a bed?
Saturday night, whenever that was. Then I only got a couple of hours.
What made you wake so soon?
Dreams?
What do you mean "dreams"?
I've always been told murderers have terrible dreams.
But only at the first.
Got over that a long time ago.
When I first took to crime, I was quite squeamish about it.
I was a most sensitive child. - You surprise me.
Used to wake screaming, thinking the police were after me.
But one gets hardened.
How did you start?
Quite a small way, like most of us.
Pilfering pennies from other children's lockers at school... then a little pocket picking, then a spot of car pinching... then smash and grab and so on to plain burglary.
Killed my first man when I was 19.
In years to come, you'll be able to take your grandchildren... to Madame Tussaud's and point me out.
Which section?
It's early to say. I'm still young.
But I'll be there, all right, in one department or another.
You'll point me out and say, "Chicks, if I were to tell you... how matey I once was with that gentleman, you'd be -"
What's the matter?
This handcuff is pinching my wrist.
Sorry.
Talking of Madame Tussaud's, that's how it all began.
What began?
My career of crime. All hereditary.
Great Uncle Penruddock.
Who was he?
My girl, where were you brought up?
Never heard of my Great Uncle Penruddock, the Cornish Bluebeard?
Got it all from him.
I thought your family came from Canada.
No, that's where they went after the Penruddock incident.
He murdered three wives and got away with it.
His third mother-in-law got the goods on him and tried to have him arrested.
Did she succeed?
No, he was too quick for her.
Took her for a walk to Land's End and shoved her into the Atlantic Ocean.
He's in Madame Tussaud's.
There's no doubt about his department.
You must go down and see him sometime.
Can't mistake him.
Third on the left as you go in.
Red whiskers and a harelip.
That, lady, is the sad story of my life.
Poor orphan boy who never had a chance.
Are you still set on giving me up to the police?
You're sure everything's going to be all right? Bound to be.
He can't have much time.
As soon as I've picked up you know what, I'll clear out of the country.
Be careful.
Wire to me.
Good-bye, my dear.
Good-bye.
Is that Professor Jordan's house?
Can I speak to Mrs. Jordan then?
Is that Mrs. Jordan?
He's gone to London already?
If you manage, I'd like hot whiskey.
I'll get the hot water.
No, he ducked down a side street, the police went the wrong way.
The girl handed him over to us, thinking we were detectives.
We had to take her as well because he told her everything.
Very good, ma'am. I see.
Yes, ma'am.
The old man's got the wind up.
He's cleared out already. - Whatever for?
He thought it too dangerous with Hannay on the loose.
He's warning the whole 39 Steps.
Has he got the - you know?
He's picking up our friend at the London Palladium on the way out.
Here's toddy.
That will be half a crown.
And the phone call?
We'll say a schilling.
Is this a hotel as well?
Do you have people staying here?
Aye.
You get a few this time of year? - Aye.
Did you have anyone in tonight? - Aye.
They weren't by any chance a young couple?
James, do not finish!
What kind of a silly creature am I married to?
Do you want to get us all jailed?
How much did you take for these?
Half a crown.
Out, the pair of you!
Do not let on to anybody that you got a drink here after hours.
You old fool.
Would you give away a young couple?
Good morning.
What's the idea?
How did we get out of these? You didn't.
I slipped out of mine last night and camped out here.
Why didn't you run away? - I did, but just as I was going...
I discovered that you've been speaking the truth.
I decided to stay.
May I ask what earthquake caused your brain to work at last?
Those two men were in here last night. I overheard them telephoning.
What did they say?
A lot of stuff about the 39 Steps. - You
What?
Someone's going to warn them. How can you warn steps?
Never mind.
Go on.
Yes, and there was another thing.
Someone got scared and is clearing out and -
And is picking up someone at the London Palladium.
London Palladium?
Is that the professor with half of the little finger missing?
What does he want to go there for?
I feel such a fool, not having believed you.
That's all right.
We ought to get a move on.
What room are those two men in? - No room.
They went as soon as they telephoned.
They what?
Didn't I tell you?
You let them go after hearing what they said?
You button-headed little idiot. - Don't talk to me like that!
Four or five precious hours wasted!
Why didn't you wake me up at once?
Even you might have realized what they said was important.
Why not leave well enough alone?
Let well alone? Good girl, I'm accused of murder!
Can't you realize the only way I can clear myself is to expose these spies? You still can.
The man's going to the London Palladium. Really?
First or second house?
I'll get there five hours late! - Fine!
The show will suit you. - What's that?
You're quite right, madame. The Air Ministry has got a new thing a lot of people are interested in.
But they are positive that no papers are missing about it... that would be of any use to a spy.
I'm certain about it. A man is leaving the country tonight with something.
Since you phoned us from Scotland this morning... we've made the minutest inquiries.
It's obvious I'm wasting my time here.
Just a moment, miss, please.
There's one thing you haven't told us.
Where's Richard Hannay?
I haven't the faintest idea.
Look here, miss, you can't -
You're in the telephone book?
If anything crops up, we'll give you a ring.
That will be all now. Thank you.
Tell Archer and Seagrave to get another taxi and follow that girl.
She'll lead us to Hannay.
# Love is a flower that blooms #
Cover every exit, and on no account let anyone leave the building.
You two men go in the orchestra pit.
Ladies and gentlemen, we shall now sing.
Move along there, please.
Come on, sir.
No one's allowed to leave the theater.
Can't a mate go out and have a drink? - Ticket, please.
I'm just looking for someone. - Can I go through, please?
Very good.
She's seen him. She's on her way down to the stalls.
May I borrow your opera glasses, please?
Excuse me. May I take your place, please?
What are you doing here? I found him.
He's up in that box. You can't do anything about it.
I've been to Scotland Yard.
Nothing has been stolen from the Air Ministry. They're certain about it.
You heard those men say he got in there. There he is.
Shall we take him now or wait till the interval?
What you going to do? There's nothing missing. There's an end to it.
Hear that tune?
That's that damn thing I couldn't get out of my head.
Now I know where I heard it before. Of course, that music hall.
Annabella's -
Ladies and gentlemen... with your kind attention and permission...
I have now the honor to present to you... one of the most remarkable men in the world. - That's the same man.
Every day he commits to memory... 50 new facts, and remembers every one of them.
Facts from history, from geography... from newspapers, from scientific textbooks... millions and millions of them down to the smallest detail.
Test him, ladies and gentlemen.
Ask him any question. I've got it!
Of course there are no papers missing.
All the information's inside Memory's head.
I still don't understand. - Don't you see?
The details of that Air Ministry secret were borrowed, memorized by this man... and then replaced before anyone could find out.
That's why he's here: to take Memory out of the country after the show.
Some gentlemen want to speak to you.
Question, please.
Where's the boat race?
When did Florence Nightingale die?
How tall is the Empire State Building? - Are you Richard Hannay?
There's something you should know.
Come along quietly.
That man on the stage -
Don't cause any trouble... - and spoil people's entertainment.
What are the 39 Steps?
Come on, answer up!
What are the 39 Steps?
The 39 Steps is an organization of spies... collecting information on behalf of the foreign office of -
Keep your seats, please!
There is no need for alarm, no cause for alarm.
I'm all right. - Sure you are.
I don't want a chair.
Let me rest here. - I'm all right.
Take it easy.
I'm all right.
Get the girls on straightaway!
The girls' introduction right away.
Mr. Memory, what was the secret formula... you were taking out of the country?
Would it be all right, me telling you, sir?
It was a big job to learn it... the biggest job I ever tackled...
and I don't want to throw it all away.
It'll be quite all right.
The first feature of the new engine is... its greatly increased ratio of compression... represented by R minus 1 over R to the power of gamma... where R represents the ratio of compression and gamma -
Seen in end elevation, the axis of the two lines of cylinders -
Angle of 65 degrees.
Dimensions of cylinders as follows -
This device renders the engine completely silent.
Am I right, sir?
Quite right, old chap.
Thank you, sir. Thank you.
I'm glad it's off my mind, at last.
How beautifully dramatic.
The crudest savage exhibition of nature at her worst without...
And we three, we elegant three within.
I should like to think that an irate Jehovah was pointing those arrows of lightning directly at my head, the unbowed head of George Gordon Lord Byron,
England's greatest sinner.
But I cannot flatter myself to that extent.
Possibly those thunders are for our dear Shelley, heaven's applause for England's greatest poet.
What of my Mary?
She is an angel.
You think so.
You hear? Come, Mary.
Come and watch the storm.
You know how lightning alarms me.
Shelley, darling, will you please light these candles for me?
Oh, Mary, darling.
Astonishing creature.
I, Lord Byron?
Frightened of thunder, fearful of the dark, and yet you have written a tale that sent my blood into icy creeps.
Look at her, Shelley.
Can you believe that bland and lovely brow conceived of Frankenstein, a monster created from cadavers out of rifled graves?
Isn't it astonishing?
I don't know why you should think so.
What do you expect?
Such an audience needs something stronger than a pretty little love story.
So, why shouldn't I write of monsters?
No wonder Murray has refused to publish the book.
He says his reading public would be too shocked.
It will be published, I think.
Then, darling, you will have much to answer for.
The publishers did not see that my purpose was to write a moral lesson of the punishment that befell a mortal man who dared to emulate God.
Well, whatever your purpose may have been, my dear,
I take great relish in savoring each separate horror.
I roll them over on my tongue.
Don't, Lord Byron. Don't remind me of it tonight.
What a setting in that churchyard, to begin with.
The sobbing women, the first clod of earth on the coffin.
That was a pretty chill.
Frankenstein and the dwarf stealing the body out of its new-made grave, cutting the hanged man down from the gallows, where he swung creaking in the wind.
The cunning of Frankenstein in his mountain laboratory, taking dead men apart and building up a human monster, so fearful and so horrible, that only a half-crazed brain could have devised.
And then the murders...
The little child drowned.
Henry Frankenstein himself thrown from the top of the burning mill by the very monster he had created.
And it was these fragile white fingers that penned the nightmare.
You've made me prick myself, Byron.
It's bleeding.
There, there.
I do think it a shame, Mary, to end your story quite so suddenly.
That wasn't the end at all. Would you like to hear what happened after that?
I feel like telling it.
It's the perfect night for mystery and horror.
The air itself is filled with monsters.
I'm all ears.
While heaven blasts the night without, open up your pits of hell.
Well, then, imagine yourself standing by the wreckage of the mill.
The fire is dying down.
Soon the bare skeleton of the building will be visible, the gaunt rafters against the sky.
Well, I must say, that's the best fire I ever saw in all me life!
What are you crying for?
It's terrible.
I know it's terrible, but after all them murders, and poor Mr. Henry being brought home to die,
I'm glad to see the monster roasted to death before my very eyes.
It's too good for him.
It's all the Devil's work, and you better cross yourself quick, Marta, before he gets you.
Come along, come along.
It's all over.
Get back to your homes. Go to sleep.
There it goes again! It ain't burned out at all. There's more yet.
Isn't the monster dead yet?
It's high time every decent man and wife was in bed.
That's his insides, caught at last.
Insides is always the last to be consumed. Move on.
You've had enough excitement for one night.
This strange man you call a monster is dead.
Monster," indeed.
You may thank your lucky stars they sent for me to safeguard life and property.
Why didn't you safeguard those what lies drowned and murdered?
Come now. We want no rioting. No riots.
Who's rioting?
Move on, move on.
Good night, all, and pleasant dreams.
Ah, pleasant dreams, yourself.
Thinks he's everybody, just because he's the burgomaster.
Poor Mr. Henry.
He was to have been married today to that lovely girl, Elizabeth.
Cover him up.
Someone must break the news to the poor girl.
Ride as fast as you can to the castle and tell the old Baron Frankenstein we are bringing his son home.
Oh, dear.
Oh, shut up.
Come home, Hans. The monster is dead now.
Nothing could be left alive in that furnace.
Why do you stay here?
I want to see with me own eyes.
Oh, Hans, he must be dead.
And dead or alive, nothing can bring our little Maria back to us.
If I can see his blackened bones,
I can sleep at night.
Come back, Hans!
You will be burned yourself!
Maria drowned to death and you burned up.
What should I do then?
No!
Hans!
Hans, where are you?
Hans!
Are you all right?
I hear you. Here. Give me your hand, Hans.
Here.
Oh, heaven, what is this?
Henry.
Tell me.
Oh, milady, how can we tell you?
Bring him in.
Albert!
What do you want?
It's alive! The monster... It's alive!
Oh, shut up, you old fool.
I saw it.
It ain't turned to no skeleton at all.
It lived right through the fire.
Go bite your tongue off. We don't believe in ghosts.
Nobody'll believe me.
All right. I wash my hands of it.
Let 'em all be murdered in their beds, for all of me. Hmph!
Speak to me, Henry.
Oh, milady, he'll never speak again.
I was foretold of this.
I was told beware my wedding night.
Oh! Look!
Milady!
He's alive!
Henry, darling!
Elizabeth.
Oh, what a terrible wedding night!
You can go to bed now, Mary.
You'll soon be better, Henry.
I feel almost myself again.
As soon as you're strong enough, we'll go away and forget all this horrible experience.
Forget?
If only I could forget, but it's never out of my mind.
I've been cursed for delving into the mysteries of life.
Perhaps death is sacred, and I've profaned it.
For what a wonderful vision it was!
I dreamed of being the first to give to the world the secret that God is so jealous of.
The formula for life.
Think of the power to create a man.
And I did. I did it!
I created a man. And who knows?
In time I could have trained him to do my will.
I could have bred a race.
I might even have found the secret of eternal life.
Henry, don't say those things. Don't think them.
It's blasphemous and wicked.
We are not meant to know those things.
It may be that I'm intended to know the secret of life.
It may be part of the divine plan. No.
No!
It's the Devil that prompts you.
It's death, not life, that is in it all and at the end of it all.
Listen, Henry.
While you have been lying here, tossing in your delirium, I couldn't sleep.
And when you raved of your insane desire to create living men from the dust of the dead, a strange apparition has seemed to appear in the room.
It comes, a figure like death, and each time it comes more clearly, nearer.
It seems to be reaching out for you as if it would take you away from me!
There it is!
Look! There!
I see nothing, Elizabeth. Where?
There's nothing there.
There!
There! It's coming for you!
Nearer! Henry!
Albert!
Drat the man.
He's never here when he's wanted.
What's the good of stuffed footmen, anyway?
All right. All right!
Don't knock the castle over.
We're not all dead yet.
There's nobody at home.
Let me in, my good woman.
I know the young Baron Frankenstein is at home.
He's sick.
He's in his bed, where all decent folk should be at this time of night.
Tell him that Dr. Pretorius is here on a secret matter of grave importance and must see him alone, tonight.
Dr. Pretorius?
Pretorius?
What was the... What was the name?
Dr. Pretorius.
Ain't no such name.
Now you stay there.
Who's there?
It's Minnie, milady.
Oh, come in.
It's Dr. Pretorius.
He says he wants to see the master.
Most insistent.
Pretorius?
He's a very queer-looking old gentleman, sir, and must see you on a secret grave matter, he said.
Tonight, alone.
Bring him in.
Henry, who is this man?
Dr. Pretorius.
Baron Frankenstein, now, I believe.
Won't you come in, Doctor?
I trust you will pardon this intrusion at so late an hour.
I would not have ventured to come had I not a communication to make, which I suspect may be of the utmost importance to yourself.
This is Professor Pretorius.
He used to be Doctor of Philosophy at the university, but...
But was booted out.
Booted," my dear Baron, is the word for knowing too much.
Henry's been very ill, Professor.
He shouldn't be disturbed.
I am also a doctor, Baroness.
Why have you come here tonight?
My business with you, Baron, is private.
Elizabeth, please.
I do hope he won't upset Henry.
What do you want?
We must work together.
Never. This is outrageous.
I'm through with it.
I'll have no more of this hell's spawn.
As soon as I'm well, I'm to be married, and I'm going away.
I must beg you to reconsider.
You know, do you not, that it is you, really, who are responsible for all those murders?
There are penalties to pay for killing people, and with your creature still at large in the countryside...
Are you threatening me?
Don't put it so crudely.
I have ventured to hope that you and I together, no longer as master and pupil, but as fellow scientists, might probe the mysteries of life and death...
Never. No further.
...and reach a goal undreamed of by science.
I can't make any further experiments. I've had a terrible lesson.
That is sad, very sad.
But you and I have gone too far to stop.
Nor can it be stopped so easily.
I also have continued with my experiments.
That is why I am here tonight.
You must see my creation.
Have you also succeeded in bringing life to the dead?
If you, Herr Baron, will do me the honor of visiting my humble abode,
I think you will be interested in what I have to show you.
After 20 years of secret scientific research and countless failures,
I also have created life, as we say, in God's own image.
I must know. When can I see it?
I thought you might change your mind.
Why not tonight?
It is not very late.
Is it far?
No, but you will need a coat.
I think your coachman had better wait here.
Won't you sit down, Herr Baron?
Before I show you the results of my trifling experiments,
I would like to drink to our partnership.
Do you like gin?
It is my only weakness.
To a new world of gods and monsters!
The creation of life is enthralling.
Distinctly enthralling, is it not?
I cannot account precisely for all that I am going to show you, but perhaps now that you are my partner, you can.
My experiments did not turn out quite like yours, Henry, but science, like love, has her little surprises, as you shall see.
Good heavens, Doctor. What are these?
There is a pleasing variety about my exhibits.
My first experiment was so lovely that we made her a queen.
Charming, don't you think?
Then, of course, we had to have a king.
Now he's so madly in love with her that we have to segregate them.
I have to be very careful with the king.
Now, behave.
My next production looked so disapprovingly at the other two that they made him an archbishop.
He seems to be asleep. I must wake him up.
The next one is the very Devil.
Very bizarre, this little chap.
There's a certain resemblance to me, don't you think?
Or do I flatter myself?
I took a great deal of pains with him.
Sometimes I have wondered whether life wouldn't be much more amusing if we were all devils, and no nonsense about angels and being good.
Oh! There's the king out again.
Even royal amours are a nuisance.
Poor archbishop. He has his hands full.
There. That will keep you quiet.
My little ballerina is charming, but such a bore.
She won't dance to anything but Mendelssohn's Spring Song, and it gets so monotonous.
My next is very conventional, I'm afraid, but you can never tell how these things will turn out.
It was an experiment with seaweed.
Normal size has been my difficulty.
You did achieve size.
I need to work that out with you.
But this isn't science.
It's more like black magic.
You think I'm mad. Perhaps I am.
But listen, Henry Frankenstein.
While you were digging in your graves, piecing together dead tissues,
I, my dear pupil, went for my materials to the source of life.
I grew my creatures, like cultures, grew them as nature does, from seed.
But still, you did achieve results that I have missed.
Now think, what a world-astounding collaboration we should be, you and I, together.
No. No, no, no.
Leave the charnel house and follow the lead of nature, or of God, if you like your Bible stories.
Male and female created He them."
Be fruitful and multiply."
Create a race, a man-made race, upon the face of the earth.
Why not?
I daren't! I daren't even think of such a thing.
Our mad dream is only half realized.
Alone, you have created a man.
Now, together, we will create his mate.
You mean...
Yes. A woman.
That should be really interesting.
No.
Don't touch me!
There she is!
Quick!
There he is!
Shoot!
Run to the village, quick! It's the monster.
Tell the burgomaster.
He's in the woods!
What is it now?
The monster, he's in the woods.
Get out the bloodhounds. Raise all the men you can.
Lock the women indoors, and wait for me.
Now then! Monster, indeed.
I'll show him. Follow me.
Where is he?
Bind him securely. I don't want anything slipshod.
Tie his feet first.
His feet first!
I get no cooperation, none at all!
Have you got him? That's what I want to know.
Have you got him?
Of course we've got him, my good woman.
And a good job, too. Mind he don't get loose again.
He might do some damage and hurt somebody.
Bring him down when you've bound him.
You want any help there?
I'll bind him!
Now, take him down to the old dungeon. Put him in chains.
There you are.
Quite simple. Now, take him out.
Come on, men. Get back to your work.
Keep still.
Now, that'll do. That's quite enough. Now come down and lock your door.
We can't take all day over this.
I'd hate to find him under my bed at night.
He's a nightmare in the daylight, he is.
Get away there!
Clear that window!
You mind your own business, and see he doesn't get out of here.
He's dangerous.
Now I can get back to more important duties.
And leave us to ours.
What?
Good night, sir.
Monster, indeed. Tush, tush.
He's loose!
Shoot him!
Help! He's loose!
Go to your homes. Just an escaped lunatic.
Merely wanted someone to handle it, that's all. Quite harmless.
Look here. Why don't you shoot him?
Oh, he's coming!
Where's Freida?
She's gone.
Freida!
Freida!
Freida!
Where is Freida?
She just left. Oh, look!
Freida!
Oh, what have they done to you?
Mrs. Neumann!
Oh! Come on!
Mrs. Neumann!
Poor old Neumann.
Where's his wife, Frau Neumann?
Frau Neumann!
Frau Neumann!
Frau Neumann!
There's another one, in there.
Frau Neumann!
Ramona, you stay close to me.
We'd better get away from these parts. It isn't safe.
Why?
I'm frightened.
The monster.
Ah! There's no danger. He's safe in jail, and they'll keep him there.
Where's the pepper and salt? We've got no pepper and salt.
All right, Mother. I'll get it. Don't worry.
You shall have your meat.
Get away from there!
Who's there?
Who is it?
You're welcome, my friend, whoever you are.
Who are you?
I think you're a stranger to me.
I cannot see you. I cannot see anything.
You must please excuse me, but I'm blind.
Come in, my poor friend. No one will hurt you here.
If you're in trouble, perhaps I can help you, but you need not tell me about it if you don't want to.
What's the matter?
You're hurt, my poor friend. Come.
Sit down.
Now tell me, who are you?
I don't understand.
Can you not speak?
It's strange.
Perhaps... Perhaps you're afflicted, too.
I cannot see, and you cannot speak.
Is that it?
If you understand what I'm saying, put your hand on my shoulder.
That is good.
No. You stay here.
I'll get you some food.
We shall be friends.
I have prayed many times for God to send me a friend.
It's very lonely here, and it's been a long time since any human being came into this hut.
I shall look after you, and you will comfort me.
And now you must lie down and go to sleep.
Yes, yes.
Now you must sleep.
Our Father, I thank Thee, that in Thy great mercy,
Thou hast taken pity on my great loneliness, and now, out of the silence of the night, hast brought two of Thy lonely children together, and sent me a friend to be a light to mine eyes
and a comfort in time of trouble.
Amen.
And now, for our lesson.
Remember?
This is bread. Bread.
Bread.
And this is wine to drink.
Drink.
Drink.
Good.
We are friends, you and I.
Friends.
Friends.
Good.
And now, for a smoke.
No, no, this is good. Smoke.
You try.
Smoke.
Good. Good.
Good.
Before you came, I was all alone.
It is bad to be alone.
Alone, bad.
Friend, good.
And now, come here.
And what is this?
This is wood for the fire.
Wood.
And this is fire.
No, no. Fire is good.
Fire, no good.
There is good, and there is bad.
Good.
Bad.
Good!
Music? A-ha!
Can you tell us how to get out of this wood? We've lost our way.
Come in, friends, and rest awhile.
Look.
It's the monster!
What are you doing?
This is my friend.
Friend?
This is the fiend that's been murdering half the countryside.
Good heavens, man. Can't you see?
Oh! He's blind!
He isn't human! Frankenstein made him out of dead bodies!
My friend. My poor friend. Why do you do this?
Friend.
Look.
Which way did he go?
This way!
He's gone this way!
Friend.
I can smell the ghosts already.
I never could stand graves.
Shut up and follow me.
Read the inscription. What does it say?
Died 1899.
Madeline Ernestine, beloved daughter of..."
Oh, never mind that. How old was she?
Age 19 years, three months."
Well, that's the one. Get to work.
What are you waiting for?
Mercy on us.
You want me to send you to the gallows where you belong?
Could be no worse than this.
Well, are you ready?
Yes.
Well, here goes.
Pretty little thing in her way, wasn't she?
I hope her bones are firm.
It heaves lighter now.
Yes.
Well, Doctor, I guess that's all for tonight.
Can we go home now? Yes.
I shall wait here for a bit.
I rather like this place.
Be careful nobody sees you leave. All right.
We know.
And leave me that lantern down there.
All right, all right!
If there's much more like this, what do you say, pal?
We give ourselves up and let 'em hang us.
That goes for me, too.
This is no life for murderers.
I give you the monster.
I thought I was alone.
Good evening.
Smoke.
Friend.
Yes, I hope so. Have a cigar.
They are my only weakness.
Good, good.
Drink, good.
Good.
You make man like me?
No. Woman.
Friend for you.
Woman. Friend.
Yes. I want friend like me.
I think you can be very useful, and you will add a little force to the argument, if necessary.
Do you know who Henry Frankenstein is and who you are?
Yes, I know.
Made me from dead.
I love dead.
Hate living.
You're wise in your generation.
We must have a long talk, and then, I have an important call to make.
Woman.
Friend.
Wife.
That Dr. Pretorius is here again, sir.
There. I knew it.
Send him away. I won't see him.
I certainly will.
Good evening, Henry.
Baroness, I've not yet had the opportunity of offering you my congratulations on your marriage.
Pray accept them now.
Dr. Pretorius,
I don't know what your business is with my husband, but whatever it may be, I tell you frankly that I am not frightened of it or of you.
Henry's been very ill. He's in no state to be alarmed or annoyed.
Your visit now is most unwelcome.
Henry, I heard the carriage drive up. I'll see that the baggage is put in.
Then we're leaving.
I think you know why I am here, Henry.
All the necessary preparations are made.
My part in the experiment is complete.
I have created by my method a perfect human brain, already living but dormant.
Everything is now ready for you and me to begin our supreme collaboration.
No, no. Don't tell me of it. I don't want to hear!
I've changed my mind. I won't do it.
I expected this.
I thought we might need another assistant.
Perhaps he can persuade you.
Nothing can persuade me.
We shall see.
No!
Not that!
Oh, he's quite harmless, except when crossed.
Frankenstein.
Yes. There have been developments since he came to me.
Sit down.
What do you want?
You know.
This is your work.
Yes.
I'll have no hand in such a monstrous thing.
Yes. Must.
Get him out. I won't even discuss it until he's gone.
Go now.
Go!
Must do it.
Never. Nothing can make me go on with it.
Now.
Put the bags in the carriage, and I'll be out in a moment.
Go and tell the master to hurry, Minnie, or we shall lose the train.
Excuse me for being so nervous, milady, but I don't like leaving you alone.
Oh, nonsense, Minnie. I shall be all right.
I hope so, milady.
Is that you, Henry?
Henry!
Henry, help!
Henry!
Milady!
Elizabeth!
The mistress!
What is it?
What's the matter?
Oh, sir!
She's gone!
The monster!
He's got her! I saw it!
The Baroness is gone!
This is Pretorius' doing.
Quick, search parties!
There's not a moment to lose.
I charge you, as you value your mistress' life, to do nothing and say nothing of this episode.
I assure you that the Baroness will be safely returned, if you will leave everything to me.
Nothing, that is, except what he demands.
I can find no trace of Elizabeth.
Oh, I admit I'm beaten.
But if you can bring her back, I'll do anything that you want.
Are you ready to complete with me this final experiment?
What about Elizabeth?
She is well and will be safely returned if you will proceed.
I'm ready.
Mind the steps. They're a bit slimy, I expect.
I think it's a charming touch.
It is interesting to think, Henry, that once upon a time, we should have been burned at the stake as wizards for this experiment.
Doctor. I think the heart is beating.
Look. It's beating, but the rhythm of the beat is uneven.
Increase the saline solution.
Is there any life yet?
No. Not life itself yet.
This is only the simulacrum of life.
This action only responds when the current is applied.
We must be patient. The human heart is more complex than any other part of the body.
Look. The beat is increasing.
Yes.
It's stopped.
Shall I increase the current?
This heart is useless.
I must have another, and it must be sound and young.
Karl.
You must go to your friend at the accident hospital.
What we need is a female victim of sudden death. Can you do it?
You promise me 1,000 crowns?
It will be well worth it, and the Baron will pay.
Yes, yes. Go and get it.
I'll try.
There are always accidental deaths occurring.
Always.
I'll get your heart. I'll go into that room.
I'll go into that room, and I'll take my knife out and I'll get it.
I'll hold her down, and there'll she be.
Where, I ask you.
Where will she be?
A thousand crowns.
It's beating perfectly, just as in life!
Oh, if only I can keep it going until...
It was a very fresh one.
Where did you get it?
I gave the gendarme 50 crowns.
What gendarme?
It was a...
Police case.
Yes, very sad, only we can't bother about that now.
Can I do anything?
No, no, no!
I can work better alone.
Work.
Where's Elizabeth?
Have you brought her?
She wait. I wait.
I'm exhausted. I must get sleep.
Work. Finish. Then sleep.
I can't work like this! He must go away. Send him away.
I'll settle him for a little while.
Drink.
Good.
That'll keep you quiet.
Elizabeth. She's dead.
Elizabeth is alive, and she is well.
I don't believe you!
I have proof.
Proof?
In a few moments from now, she will speak to you from where she is through this electrical machine.
Where is she?
Not far from here.
Speak, and she will hear you and answer.
Yes?
Yes, this is Henry.
Henry, yes, I'm safe. But, Henry, how long?
Come for me. I'm in a cave...
Elizabeth?
Elizabeth!
She's gone.
That is all now, but you heard her.
Yes. She's alive.
As soon as our work is completed, she will be returned to you.
The heart is beating more regularly now.
Yes. It's been beating for nine hours.
Not yet, but soon.
And the brain?
Perfect and already in position.
Then we are almost ready.
Almost.
Shall we put the heart in now?
Yes.
Ludwig!
It's beating quite normally now.
Bring it over.
The storm is rising.
All right.
The air is heavy with electricity.
It's going to be a terrific storm.
We shall be ready.
Isn't it amazing, Henry, that lying here, within this skull, is an artificially developed human brain, each cell, each convolution, ready, waiting for life to come.
Look. The storm is coming up over the mountains.
It will be here soon.
The kites! Are the kites ready?
Yes!
Then send them up as soon as the wind rises. Hurry, hurry.
The kites!
The kites! Get 'em ready!
Ludwig!
Seems that he wants the kites!
Stand back.
Stand by the roof!
Cosmic diffuser!
Wires!
Send down your wires!
All right, stop your windlass. I'm coming up.
Now, up with the kites. You take number two, Ludwig.
You've checked your connections? Yes.
Stand by!
Let go number one.
Let it go, Karl!
It's coming up!
Go back. Go back down!
Go down!
No, don't!
No! Get away!
Frankenstein!
Get away! Get away!
No, don't.
No. Don't come near me!
Get away!
Don't! No!
No!
Get back!
Don't!
Don't!
Raise the cosmic diffuser.
Remove the diffuser bands.
She's alive!
Alive!
The bride of Frankenstein.
Friend?
Friend?
Stand back.
She hate me.
Like others.
Look out!
The lever!
Get away from that lever!
You'll blow us all to atoms.
Henry!
Undo the door!
Henry!
Get back!
Get back!
I won't unless you come!
But I can't leave them! I can't!
Yes. Go. You live!
Go.
You stay.
We belong dead.
Darling. Darling.
Gypo!
Ah, Gypo, what's the use?
I'm hungry and I can't pay my room rent.
Have you the price of a flop on you?
No!
Oh, what's the use?
Ah, don't look at me like that, Gypo. You're all I got.
You're the only one. You know that.
But what chance have we to escape?
Money.
Some people have all the luck.
Look at that thing handing us the ha-ha.
10 pounds to America.
20 pounds and the world is ours.
What are you saying that for?
Saying what? 20 pounds?
What are you driving at?
Oh, Gypo, what's the matter with you?
20 pounds. Might as well be a million. Go on.
Go on!
Go and get your 20 pounds from that scut I threw in the gutter.
Say, Gypo.
Too good for me, eh?
Well, let me tell you something. You're no better than any other man.
You're all alike!
Oh, Katie, I didn't mean it.
Go along with you and your fine principles.
I can't afford 'em!
Katie!
Throw light over there, lads.
Paddy's not out tonight, boys.
Don't you know me, Gypo?
I don't wonder that you stare.
I'm lucky to be finding you here.
Man, what is it?
What are you staring at?
You came up to me so...
sudden like.
I guess I'm getting jumpy.
Finding out there's a price on my head.
20 pounds. Oh, so that's all I'm worth!
Six months is a long time, my boy, to be on the run.
Sleeping out in the hills, freezing to death.
And no decent grub.
So I says to myself, "I'll sneak into town and I'll see my mother."
And I'll duck right out again." And here I am.
Did you deliver my messages?
And what did my mother say?
Ah, she blessed the saints that you're alive.
She followed me out crying and put a half a quid in my hand.
To give to you.
Well, I was that hungry meself that I... I spent it.
That was her way of giving it to you!
She likes you, Gypo. The Lord knows why.
What's come over you?
What are you gawking at?
Is there something queer about me?
No, Frankie.
You see, I've been court-martialled.
Man, what for?
You remember the Tan that killed Quincannon?
We drew lots for it, and I got the short match.
Well, I took him out in the lorry...
and he begged for his life.
I couldn't do it, Frankie. Not in cold blood.
Besides, he swore he'd desert if I let him go.
And you believed him?
What did Commandant Gallagher say?
He near had me plugged when I went back to report.
Then they threw me out of the organisation.
And now the British think I'm with the Irish and the Irish think I'm with the British.
And the long and short of it is
I'm walking around starving without a dog to lick my trousers.
Ah, you poor fathead!
Think of the jobs we've pulled off together, the scrapes we've come through.
Ah, we were a great pair, eh, Gypo?
With your muscle and my brain.
When you got into a tight place, it was me that thought a way out.
Remember?
And I leave you alone for a minute and you go and get in trouble again.
Man alive! I'm your brain!
But it's your help I'm needing now.
I looked you up first to find out if the Tans were still watching my mother's house.
Is there any guard on the house?
Not since Christmas.
Well, I'm off. If I get a chance to see Gallagher, I'll put the word in for you.
Up the rebels!
Carry on.
Yes?
Well, I... It's like this.
I...
Well, speak up. What do you want to say?
I've come to claim the 20 pounds reward for Frankie McPhillip.
Frankie McPhillip?
Right now, men, let's go.
Mary, the bread's that fresh, I can't cut it.
Look at the crumbs it's made.
Oh, my boy! My boy! - Mother!
Mary!
Oh, Frankie!
Oh, praise be to God. You've come back to us.
Save your praise for this fog that's upon us, Mother.
It's the best friend I have this night.
And me dodging down dark streets to get here.
Oh, I was so homesick to see you.
I'd have walked down the middle of O'Connell Street to get a glimpse of you.
Ah, mercy, my son.
Sure, you must be starving!
Frankie, you shouldn't have come. It's not safe.
Ah, what a long face for a sister.
I'm in with the fog and I'm out with the fog and nobody'll be the wiser.
Nobody's seen you? - Just my pal Gypo Nolan.
See, I had to find out if the Tans had a guard on the house.
Have a nice cup of tea. You can do all your talking afterwards.
Come on, get on the front door there.
Get on the door there. Machine gunner!
Machine gunner! Get on the rear.
Open the place.
No!
Let me out!
Out of the way.
Stay back. Stay back! Stay back.
Frankie, no!
Where's McPhillip?
He's not here. Get out!
No, Frankie! Frankie! Mary!
Clear out of the way! Get out of the way and let me shoot!
Get out of the way!
Move out!
Frankie, no! Stop!
Yes?
Yes.
Right.
McPhillip was killed trying to escape, sir.
20 pounds. You'd better count it.
Show him out the back way.
Why, you!
Whisky.
There's a lot of things I'd like if I could afford it.
Good night.
I've got to have a plan.
I've got to have a plan.
Ah, Gypo, I'm your brain.
You can't think without me.
You're lost. You're lost.
What do you want to be sneaking up behind a man like that for?
I've been looking all over for you.
I'm sorry I blew up at you like that - out in the street, I mean.
Ah, Gypo.
You know I love you. You're the only one.
You know that.
Sometimes I get so crazy I don't know what I'm doing.
I've got it.
I did it for you.
You did what?
You forgot your change, me boyo.
Gypo, where did you get that money?
And not an hour ago, you hadn't a penny to warm your pocket.
Did somebody die and leave you a pot of gold?
What are you saying that for?
Well, did you rob a church or what?
That's it.
You mean you robbed a church?
No, it wasn't a church.
It was a sailor, off an American ship.
Shh!
Not so loud.
I went through him behind Cassidy's pub on Jerome Street.
He was drunk.
But if you say a word of it you'll get me into trouble. Who, me?
What do you take me for?
An informer?
Why are you talking about informing?
Who's an informer? ! - Gypo!
Don't be saying that.
What's the matter here?
Oh, it's all right, Barney. Let him alone.
He didn't mean any harm.
Come on. Let's get out of here.
Come on up to my room. There's a nice warm fire there.
Here's your money. You'll be all right.
Darling, you don't want any more of that.
Let's get in the car. I'll take you back...
Ah, no, Gypo.
Gypo!
You gave him a pound note!
I forgot something.
They'll be wondering why I'm not there already.
'Tis the work of an informer.
'Tis surely. 'Tis the work of an informer.
Oh, Frankie!
Oh, Frankie!
Don't cry, Mother.
I'm sorry for your trouble, Mrs. McPhillip.
What are you shouting for?
Don't you know there's a wake going on?
Ah, let him alone, Bartly.
Sure, he was a friend of my dead boy's.
All the same, you should show more respect for the dead.
Leave 'em alone!
Sure, I was only going to give them back to you, Mr. Nolan.
I swear by all that's holy I warned him to keep away from this house.
Good heavens, man, there's no one suspects you.
Sure, that's right, Gypo.
No one suspects you.
You've been very good to me, Mrs. McPhillip.
I'm sorry for your trouble.
Gypo! Gypo!
Gypo!
My life, what are you hurrying for?
What makes you think I'm in a hurry?
Don't be getting your rag out, me boyo.
'Tis a free country, and a man can ask questions without all this gusting.
Especially from an old pal.
Are you working now?
No!
Don't be shouting at me like an Aboriginal.
You can't blame us for taking a friendly interest in you for old times' sake, seeing as how you were one of us at one time.
You don't seem to be in any need of money tonight, Gypo.
Bartly!
What's wrong, boys? What are you up to? - He suspects me!
Suspects you of what?
I didn't say anything, Bartly...
You're a liar! You did!
Both of you.
And well I know you. You're Gallagher's right-hand men...
Shut up, Gypo.
Are you mad? Don't you know there are people listening?
Don't be accusing me, then.
Let's get out of here. - No.
Gallagher wants to see you.
Well, I'm not going.
Come on, man! He's not going to eat you.
Is it afraid of the commandant you are? Afraid?
I'm not afraid of the finest man that was ever whipped!
Come on, man...
Keep your hands off me.
Come on.
Captain Mulholland, sir.
Gypo Nolan.
Well, Gypo.
You don't seem glad to see me.
You've got a grudge against me.
There isn't a thing I wouldn't do for you, Dan Gallagher.
But you had me court-martialled and expelled from the organisation.
You disobeyed orders, endangered the organisation.
You had a fair trial, Gypo.
Only for me, you wouldn't have got away as easy as you did.
There were others who wanted to give you this.
Forget that.
We've got something on hand now that's as much your business as ours.
Frankie McPhillip was your pal... wasn't he?
I want your help, that's all.
This looks like the job of an informer.
We have to get that informer, understand?
If you don't help us with this job, people might think...
It isn't that. It isn't that.
Look here, Commandant.
It's... it's how... it's how...
Oh, I don't know what I'm doing!
What's the matter, Gypo?
What's the matter?
The last six months I've been starving, that's what's the matter.
I've been living from hand to mouth on whatever I could foray from sailors.
I got no clothes. I got no money.
I got nothing.
Look here, Gypo.
I'm going to make a fair deal with you.
Last October you put us all in a very dangerous position.
We'll call it quits and reinstate you. On one condition.
That you find the man that's informed on Frankie McPhillip.
Do you mean that?
Indeed I do, Gypo.
Put it there, Danny, my boy.
Put it there.
What did I tell you?
What did I tell you, Bartly?
There isn't anything I wouldn't do for you, Dan.
There isn't anything I wouldn't do.
Can we have a drink on that?
Let's have a little drink on that.
Have a drink on the commandant, Tommy.
Bartly, my boy, a little drink for you.
Ah, that's fine stuff.
It's good stuff, Bartly, eh?
Danny, there isn't anything I wouldn't do for you. There isn't anything.
Ah, it's nice to be friendly.
I'd go through fire and water for you.
Who informed on Frankie McPhillip?
I'll tell you.
It was that rat Mulligan.
Mulligan?
Mulligan, the tailor?
As sure as you were born, it was him.
How do you make that out?
I'll tell you, Commandant.
I didn't like to say it meself.
A man can't be too sure about a thing like that.
But, as you said it yourself, Commandant, in the way you put it...
Hurry up, man.
That's fine stuff.
How didn't I think of that before?
It... it was the grudge! - What grudge?
Oh, the grudge.
The grudge.
Th-th-that Mulligan had on Frankie!
About what?
Ah, it's a long long story.
It's a long story.
There's another little drink in the bottle.
Take it.
Man alive, you've eradicated the bottle.
Ah, Tommy, Tommy.
Come on now, Gypo, out with it.
Do you remember his sister Suzy?
Whose sister?
Mulligan's.
What has she got to do with it?
What has she got to do with it?
Why shouldn't she have something to do with it?
Wasn't she in trouble?
And wasn't Frankie the boyo that was named?
I never heard that.
Well... well, it's true, anyway.
Well... Here.
Figure that out for your...
That's why Mulligan informed.
That's why Mulligan informed.
I saw him going to the Tan... Tans' headquarters tonight.
What time?
What time?
Half past six.
Well?
Are you taking me back, then?
If your statement checks up, you'll get back.
There's a court of inquiry at 1:30 at the ammunition dump. Be there. Take him up.
Arrange to meet him somewhere.
Bartly, my boy, you'll find me down at Katie Madden's.
Right.
I'll see you boys later.
Bartly, my boy.
Show him out.
It's him, Dan. I'd stake my life on it. He's the one that did it.
He's drunk.
Drunk, is it? It's a wonder he can walk at all.
Tell me, how has Mary taken it?
Her heart is dying inside of her, Commandant, but you'd never know it.
She's waiting for you, Dan.
Look, it would be God's own mercy for you to go and see her.
One thing is certain. We must destroy that informer.
It may be Gypo, but I don't believe it.
He was Frankie's friend and had no motive.
Or it may be Mulligan, though I doubt it again.
Whoever it was, we've got to find them tonight.
One traitor can destroy an army.
It's his life against ours.
You understand, Bartly?
I do.
Keep at Gypo's heels like a pot of glue.
Find out all you can and bring him to the ammunition dump at 1:30.
Find Captain Conlon. He's to mobilise his company and round up Mulligan. - I'll attend to the rest.
Get started. - Right.
Time! Come along, it's closing time.
Time now! You heard what he said.
Go on, off you go.
Gypo!
Stand up, man. Stand up.
Shake hands with Gallagher's right hand.
Come on!
What are you looking at me for?
I'm not looking at you.
You're a liar.
You're a liar!
You can't just... I can see you looking at me.
A cat can look at a king.
What are you talking about kings for?
Hear, hear.
Don't be talking about kings around here.
You'll be getting into trouble.
Ah, you're drunken!
Break it up. Break it up.
What do you think you're doing?
I saw you hit that man.
You've got no business hitting men like that.
You'll have to come to the station.
What a blow, Gypo. What a blow.
Ah, will you look at the two of them. Lying there sweet and peaceful as the babes in the wood.
And, gentlemen, there's the hand that rocked the cradle.
Me old Gypo!
Hurry! Hurry!
Run, Gypo! Run!
So, you'll try and beat up a policeman, will you?
Ah, let me go, I had nothing to do with it at all.
I want to get me pipe and me hat!
I paid three shillings for that pipe.
Will you let me get back there and get me pipe and me hat?
Ah, Gypo, me old son...
Gentlemen. I have an announcement.
Quiet, people.
With my own two eyes, I saw Gypo knock Maloney flying across the road,
like a man diving off the Bull Wall.
Who is he? Who is he? Who is he?
He's Gypo Nolan, and he's as strong as any bull.
Hey, Gypo, am I right? - Didn't you ever hear of him?
I tell you what this boyo is - he's a king. That's what he is. King Gypo.
Wasn't he pals with Frankie McPhillip who was shot by the Black and Tans tonight?
When you mention the dead, you add, "The Lord have mercy on his soul."
Unity, boys, now. Unity.
Did you hear what he said? - Aye.
May the Lord have mercy on his soul."
He died fighting for Ireland to be free, and every man here should do the same thing.
And I'll do it when my time is called, and so will King Gypo.
So will King Gypo.
Am I right, Gypo, milord?
Right.
Quiet!
Silence here. Quiet, everybody.
Gypo, you have the floor.
I want everybody to come and have some fish and chips with King Gypo!
Silence! Quiet!
Silence! Quiet, he said.
Quiet!
Proceed, Gypo.
Come on, every man jack and woman too. It's all on Gypo.
You hear that?
You're all guests of King Gypo.
Am I right, Gypo? Right.
And before long, I'm going to be the cock of the walk around here.
Me and Commandant Gallagher.
It's a secret.
You hear that?
It's a secret.
Come on, chuck 'em out. Come on, every man jack.
I'll pay for the lot.
Blimey, it's a lot of people, guv'nor.
Yes, but they're a lovely crowd.
And every Tom and Judy is a friend of Gypo's.
Now, do you get that?
Come on, you little scut. Get busy now, come on. Here, this'll pay for the lot.
Now, do you hear that? He's going to pay for it.
Didn't I tell you?
Blimey! Two quid!
Come on, let's let them have it.
Now, order, please. Ladies first. Ladies first.
Gypo's buying fish and chips! Don't cost a ha'penny. Get in there.
Hey, come on. Get some grub.
Leave me alone. Let go.
No, I don't want any.
Leave me alone or I'll smash you!
It's a fight you're looking for, are you?
So that's what's the matter. It's a fight you're looking for. You'll get plenty fight...
Let me have him.
No, let me have him.
What's the trouble? What's the trouble?
Bartly, my boy!
Hey, let him alone. He's a friend of mine.
Get inside there!
Lay a hand on my friend?
Come on, man. Come and have some grub.
I'm in a hurry, Gypo.
But I'll see you at one o'clock.
You know where I mean.
Sure, my boy! Sure!
Oh, it's a fine night!
The finest night of my life!
Gypo!
That reminds me.
There's somebody waiting for me.
You know what I mean.
Good night, all! - Gypo!
Gypo!
Gypo!
Wait for me, you darling. Wait for me.
Ah, Gypo, you have a sweet voice. A sweet voice.
Listen.
Even the birds are still.
Where are you taking me to, you little scut?
I have to get to Katie's.
Ah, there you go, there you go, talking about Katie.
And we having a fine little jamboree.
Don't worry about your little Judy. She'll be all right on the streets. Hey!
Hey, what are you doing? What you doing? You big stiff!
You're drunk, that's what you are! You're as drunk as a fiddler's dog!
Hey, take your hands off me!
You think you're a king, do you?
Well, you're a big lump of beef, that's all you are. A big lump of beef.
You're drunk, and your last penny is spent, and I have no further use for you, Mr. Gypo Nolan.
Ipso facto.
And another thing.
Oh, be the holy...
Where did you get it, Gypo? There's enough there to choke a horse.
And me joking about it a few minutes ago.
Ah, Gypo, me boy, you're a king, and the descendant of kings.
I'd fight for you, and die for you when the time comes.
And there's me hand on it, Gypo.
The hand of a man that's loyal and true.
Am I right, Gypo?
Come on, you scut. I'm going to find Katie!
Yes, and I'm the boy to lead you to her.
Come on, she's a lovely girl, Gypo. A lovely girl.
You should be proud of her. You should be proud of her.
Come on, don't waste the whole night on her.
I tell you, it's not the place.
Will you listen to the man? Are you trying to insinuate that I'd lead you astray, lead King Gypo astray?
Never!
Up the barricades first! Up the barricades and die like a man.
I don't know where I'm at.
Listen, you're in front of Aunt Betty's, the finest shebeen in town, and your little Katie is inside.
You hear her laughing and singing? And they're playing the piano.
Open up! Open up! Or I'll put my fist through the door!
What do you want?
Open up and find out.
Open wider, or I'll smash you to a molecule.
Oh, you will, will you?
Gypo! Show him he can't intimidate us!
Up the rebels!
What do you want?
What does he want? What does he want?
Don't be disrespectful to me friend Gypo, or you'll have me to settle with.
Ah, shut your gob!
And what do you mean, breaking in here?
I'm looking for Katie Madden.
Well, you won't be finding her here.
Come on... Come back. Come back, Gypo.
Come on back and face them like a man.
Aw, get out! Get out!
Throw 'em out!
Throw 'em out!
You're in the wrong place, my young man.
Can't you see we're having a party? Now get out! Get out before I throw you out!
Katie.
My name isn't Katie.
What is it you want?
That's what I'm asking. What do you want?
What do you suppose, you old harridan? A drink.
You'll get no drink here, you... social climber!
Go back to the gutter where you belong.
Don't talk to Gypo and me like that. And don't be looking down your nose, either, you old squint.
I suppose you think we have no money?
Well, we have lashes of it.
Am I right, Gypo, or am I wrong?
What did I tell yous?
He's as rich as Croesus.
Give everybody a drink. I'm calling for drinks for the house.
Glasses for everybody!
Glasses for everybody!
Gypo!
Music! Music!
Music for me old friend and bosom companion!
Music for King Gypo!
And if there's anyone here thinks he's a match with his fists, kindly step up.
Am I right, Gypo, or am I wrong?
You're right.
Wait! Shut up! Go to the devil, all of you!
There's more drink where this came from.
There's more where this came from.
Gypo!
Stop it!
Stop it, stop it, stop it!
Do you want to get me picked up by the police?
I'll keep order for you.
Who's making all the row?
The first one that opens his mouth above a whisper...
I'll crack his skull open.
And he'd enjoy doing it.
Yeah.
Gypo!
I'll teach you to behave like a gentleman amongst ladies.
Hey. 'Scuse me.
Can you play "All Those Endearing Charms"?
Believe Me If All Those Endearing Young Charms".
That's what I said!
Do you hear? That's what he said.
Oh, Dan!
Mary, darling.
You shouldn't have come. What if the Tans come back?
It's all right, dear. My lads are outside.
Poor darling. I know how you feel.
And there's nothing I can say or do to help, except... well...
I wish it could have been me instead of... Frankie.
If I lost you, I would only want to die.
Poor Mother.
Oh, Dan, when is this trouble going to end, this... this killing and more killing?
It's hard on you women, I know. You're braver than we are.
Oh, I'm sorry, dear.
I love you, Mary.
I love you, Dan!
I must ask you some questions... about Frankie. May I?
Of course.
There must have been an informer, you know that?
The man who knew about Frankie knows enough to destroy us all.
The moment he's frightened, he'll tell the Tans everything.
And they'll wipe us out.
I'm not thinking about myself.
It's the organisation. It's Ireland. You know that, don't you?
I know that, dear.
I have to find that informer.
Did Frankie think he was followed when he came home tonight?
He was sure he wasn't.
Had he seen or spoken to anybody?
Nobody.
Only his friend Gypo Nolan.
He had to ask him if there was a guard on the house.
Where?
Let's see.
The Dunboy House, I think he said.
Mm. I see.
Did he mention a man named Mulligan?
No, I'm sure not.
We're holding a court of inquiry at 1:30.
Can you come?
I need you.
If you need me, I'll come.
I'll come back for you about one o'clock.
Can you slip out the back way?
What would I do if anything happened to you? Whatever happens to you it happens to my own heart!
Commandant, there's a patrol of Tans in the neighbourhood.
I forgot something.
I gotta be going.
Gypo!
Gypo!
Oh, Gypo, come on back now and I'll get you a nice drink.
And I'll sing you another song. Come on.
How contemptible you are. You only tolerate him because of his money.
Watch what you're saying, my fine lady.
I know you hate me.
Simply because I'm... I'm not coarse. Simply because I'm...
I hate you because you're stuck-up and think you're better than anybody else.
I had no right to come here.
I should have gone to the police.
Police?
Oh, none of that talk.
Keep away from the police.
What do you want the police for?
I want to get back home.
Where's your home?
It's... it's near London.
Now, listen, Gypo, be very careful.
Don't do anything you'll regret, Gypo.
How much would it cost to get back there?
There. There's your fare.
Five pounds!
What are you after doing, Gypo?
Now, don't be afraid.
Now get outta here and go home. Keep the money. Go on.
But... keep away from the police.
You're a good man. A good man.
Five pounds! On my immortal soul!
Gypo, do you know what...
That's all right, deary.
But she owes me four pounds for board and lodging.
Now, who's gonna pay me that?
Oh, shut your gob!
And not another word.
Now, listen, Gypo, don't start this all over again...
Two and five is seven, and four is eleven.
Eleven pounds.
Ladies and gentlemen, you've seen the wonders of our generosity.
Money scattered like snuff at a wake. I want you to drink a health to King Gypo, as brave as a lion and as strong as a bull.
I'd go through fire and water for him, and he'd do the same for me.
From now on, from this night, wherever you see one of us, you'll see the other.
Or vice versa, as the case may be.
Am I right or am I wrong, Gypo?
Right.
I ask you to drink to the undying friendship...
Shut up!
And who, may I ask, has the impertinence to tell me and Gypo to shut up?
Quiet!
Make way there.
Make way!
Bartly, my boy!
Come and have a drink.
Come along, Gypo. It's time to be going. Ha-ha!
Be off with you! Who are you to be giving me orders? Bash him, Gypo.
Bash him.
Who does he think he is, giving orders to us?
I said shut up!
They're not my orders, they're Gallagher's.
And you'd better be careful about disobeying them.
You're right, Bartly.
Is it one o'clock?
It is.
I know who they are. Them's the Republican Army. The Republican Army.
I'm no friend of Gypo.
He wormed his way into my confidence.
I'm a son of Erin, and I'd never lift me hand against the crown.
Crown or no crown, army or no army, who's going to pay me for that last round of drinks?
Come on, Gypo.
Let's go.
You ought to be thrown into the Liffey, you old hag!
For serving liquor after hours, and on the holy day of obligation.
Not so fast, you little snake.
You can pay for the drinks yourself.
Now, listen, Aunt Betty. You're a lovely, quiet, decent little woman.
Give me till tomorrow till I raise the wind.
Tomorrow, is it?
McCabe!
McCabe!
Oh dear, oh dear.
I have a queer feeling there's going to be a strange face in heaven in the morning.
Gypo!
Katie. Katie.
I've been looking all over for you.
Where have you been?
I was in my digs. I waited for you. Why didn't you come?
What's wrong, Gypo?
Where are they taking you?
Ah, Katie, it's all right. It's all right. Don't you worry.
Gallagher's taking me back.
Ah, shut up! Come on. - Shut up, Gypo.
Let's get out of here.
Wait... Wait...
Let's get out of here.
Will you stop? Keep your hands off me, will you?
Do you remember the 20 pounds I was talking about?
The 20 pounds?
I got it. I got it for you.
I got it for you.
20 pounds.
20 pounds. - Come on!
You've had enough talk.
Come on, Gypo.
Gypo!
All right, sir.
Attention!
Our case is prepared, gentlemen.
Watch out below!
Let me alone, will you?
Hello, boys! Here I am!
And I can fight the best six men that ever walked the earth. Come on.
Danny... Danny, me boy.
Am I right? You and me, we can put 'em in the ground. Come on.
What's the matter with your eye, Bartly?
He got me riled. I gave him a backhander.
Sit down.
Give me my hat, will you?
There's my hat.
Mulligan.
What brings you here?
Man alive, you ought to be in bed.
This is no hour for a sick man to be out.
Dan, I...
Listen, men.
I had a drop taken before I came here, and I didn't know what I was saying.
But... now I remember.
That's the one that informed on Frankie McPhillip.
I saw him and he knows it.
It's a lie!
It's a lie!
I swear, I never left the house except to go to the chapel to say my prayers.
Ha-ha-ha, me fine boyo!
It's easy work for an informer to be swearing oaths.
It's a lie! It's a lie!
Sit down, Gypo.
Sit down.
Peter Mulligan, do you recognise the authority of this court?
I do, Commandant. Heaven knows I do.
Stand here and give the court an account of your whereabouts from noon today.
Could you find no better man to carry off in the middle of the night than me, that's having to work my hands off a- stitching in a basement so cold and damp that I've caught me death of cold?
I'm sorry, Mulligan, start at noon.
At noon today I was lying in my bed.
I had a pain in my side from bronchitis all morning and I had to stay in my bed.
Then, at one o'clock, the old woman gave me a cup of tea and an egg.
I remember I couldn't eat the egg - a good egg, too. But good or bad, no matter.
I had to get up then on account of a suit that had to be finished for Mick Foley.
It's got to be ready by Friday. His daughter's getting married...
Never mind Foley. Tell us about yourself. There y'are.
There y'are. Hear what he said?
Come on, Mulligan. Make a clean breast of it.
It's not for me to condemn you, Gypo. Maybe you're not responsible.
Why, blast you! What are you driving at?
Sit down, Gypo, and keep quiet.
Do you think?
Sit down.
Bartly, me boy.
Shut up!
Continue, Mulligan.
Well, I worked on till about half past three or maybe a quarter to four, when Charlie Corrigan came in and said his brother Dave was just out of prison.
Where is he?" "He's upstairs", says he.
We went up and we talked over a cup of tea till about six o'clock - yes, it was just six
I remember I heard the Angelus beginning to strike on my way down the stairs, because I remember I stopped to cross myself.
Then I ran down home and put on my overcoat - this one, second-hand it is - and I went to the chapel to... I'm making the Stations of the Cross.
How far is the chapel from your house?
It's maybe 100 yards, maybe it's more.
If you go around by King's, it's less, but if you go the long way around...
Let's say it's 100 yards. You arrived at the chapel about three minutes past six.
How long did you stay?
I stayed till about half past six, and then I stayed outside talking to Father Conroy for about ten minutes...
Anyone else?
I was coming to that.
Then, after I left Father Conroy, I met Barney Kerrigan there...
Near the chapel?
Yes, it must be within 50 yards of it if you're going by measurements...
Never mind.
You couldn't have been near the Black and Tans' headquarters at six?
Heaven forbid.
I hope to die right here if I was.
You liar! You liar!
Sit down!
Liar, Bartly! - Shut up!
What did you do after you left Kerrigan?
I went back to the house and did a bit more work till about eight.
Then I felt the pain in my side again and I went to my bed.
Till three men, under Mr. Tom Connor there, came in and bundled me into a cab without a by-your-leave, as if I was a criminal.
One more question.
Do you bear anyone a grievance - about your sister Suzy, I mean?
My sister Suzy, is it?
Sure, my sister Suzy's name is Mary Ellen.
For 28 years she's been living in Boston. She's the mother of eight children.
That's enough.
It is that.
Did you bear any man a grudge?
I bear no man a grudge, on me oath.
No grievance against Frankie McPhillip?
The Lord have mercy on his soul. What for? I hope his sorrows are over him.
I swear on my immortal soul, Miss McPhillip, I bore no grudge against your brother.
Kerrigan, did you meet Peter Mulligan at about half past six this evening?
Are you sure about the time?
I'm certain. It was just about half six. I was...
As you were.
Yes, sir.
Bartly, Bartly, Bartly.
You will be taken home in the car that brought you here.
I'm sorry this had to happen.
For now, this may help you.
We'll see what can be done for you later.
Good night, Mulligan. Show him out, Kerrigan.
Hey! Wait a minute.
He did it!
Now, Gypo, tell us what you did with your time from six o'clock this evening until Mulholland picked you up at one.
What's it to do with you where I was?
Tell us what you did after meeting Frankie McPhillip at the Dunboy House at six.
It's a lie!
I'm sorry, Mary, repeat what Frankie told you when he came home tonight.
He said that he met him at the Dunboy House.
He said he had to make sure there was no guard on our home.
Is that true, Gypo?
If not, why did you say at the wake that you warned him to stay away?
That's it. That's what I told him.
You did see him!
Why did you tell those lies about Mulligan? Were you drunk or what?
Well, I...
I'd taken me a drop.
Maybe two.
What did you do after leaving Frankie?
What did you do after leaving Frankie?
Well, it was...
Suppose I don't tell you.
What will you do? Suit yourself.
If you don't want to tell me, Bartly Mulholland here can do it for you.
Come on. Better tell us.
I...
I-I-I-I'm all mixed up.
I-I don't know what I'm doing.
I was... I'm drunk.
Dan, I... I don't know what I'm doing, that's all. I don't know what I'm doing.
Where did you get the money you spent?
I can't make nothing out, Dan. I'm drunk.
You broke your first pound in Ryan's. The blind man says you gave him a pound.
He did, he did, the poor man.
A pound note, he gave me.
Two pounds you spent on fish and chips.
Two pounds went for drinks in the shebeen, where Mulholland found you.
Five pounds you gave to some woman.
Four pounds you gave to another woman, known as Aunt Betty.
And finally, you gave five pounds to Katie Madden.
That makes just 20 pounds.
Ah, me head is sore, Dan. I'm drunk...
Where did you get that 20 pounds? !
I can't remember. I can't remember, Dan.
Confess, man. Ease your soul.
Who was the informer?
I didn't know what I was doing, Dan.
I didn't know what I was doing, Dan.
I didn't know what I was doing.
You can see what I mean.
Bartly! Boys!
Isn't there a man here that can tell me why I did it?
Me head is sore. I can't tell him. I-I can't tell him.
I don't know why I did it.
I don't know why I did it.
Dan! - No.
Lock him up.
Come on, Gypo. Come on.
Come on. - I don't know why I did it...
Bartly, I didn't know what I was doing. I...
Oh, the Lord have mercy on him.
I'm sorry you had to see this.
Why must we be killing one another?
What good will it do?
Oh, why can't we have peace?
Have mercy on us all. - It's all over now, dear.
I'll take you home in just a moment.
It's not a matter of revenge. You know that.
When a man turns informer, it's his life or ours.
Bartly, carry on.
You're next, Donahue.
Next.
Dennis, draw.
No, you go first.
I'm not afraid to draw last.
What difference does it make?
You're nearest - draw.
Why should I?
Come on, it's your turn.
How do you make that out, man?
Come on, draw.
Are you afraid, or what?
No.
It's your shot, Dennis.
Commandant!
Bartly! He's gone!
Take him down below, men!
Come on! Come on!
He got away, Dan. The fog's so thick you can't see your hand before your face.
Who's that?
It's Kerrigan.
His jaw is smashed to a jelly.
That Gypo's an inhuman monster.
We've got to work fast.
If he reaches the Tans before we get him, the whole movement's finished.
Tommy and Daly cover the Tans' headquarters, front and rear.
You take the rest in the van and try to head him off before he crosses the river.
Barry, get reinforcements for Mulholland.
Jump to it! We're done for if he gets away.
Frankie!
Gypo!
They're after me, Katie.
You put the heart crosswise in me. Where've you been?
They're after me, but they won't get me.
We'll get away.
Gypo, shh.
Where's the 20 pounds I gave you?
What are you talking about?
I did it for you.
That's what I couldn't tell Gallagher.
They wouldn't understand.
You did what?
What have you done?
I informed on Frankie.
Ah, Gypo.
May God have mercy on your soul.
We'll get away. They won't get me.
That's how I love you, darling.
I sold out my old pal for you.
Oh, this is a lovely fire.
Oh, it's a lovely fire.
Lie and rest yourself.
Oh, 'tis good. Good.
You don't know what it is to be running around in the fog on a night like this.
Katie. Katie.
Sit down beside me, darling.
Me darling. Darling.
You're the only one I can trust now.
Do you love me, Katie?
Yes, I love you, Gypo.
I'll love you when I'm clay.
But you don't know what you've done to me.
You don't know what you've done.
I'd lay my life down for you.
You poor blind boy.
What time is it, Dan?
Half past five.
Who's that?
Mother's going to church next door.
Dan, what if you don't find him?
I'd die if I lost you too. I couldn't stand it.
I'm not thinking about myself, darling.
It's all the others, the movement. Ireland.
That poor fool knows so blasted much.
If only there was something I could do.
It's this horrible waiting.
Can't I do anything?
Sure.
Tell me you love me again.
I love you, Dan. I'll always love you.
No matter what happens, there'll never be anyone else.
Commandant. - Yes?
She wants to see you.
She insists on it. - Who?
Who?
She won't talk to a soul...
I'm Katie Madden. I'm... Gypo Nolan's girl.
Shut the door.
I've come to beg of you on my knees.
He didn't know what he was doing.
You can't hurt him if you know how it was.
Do you know what he did? There's a dead boy lying across the hall.
Yes, and I know why. He didn't know what he was doing. For me.
Almighty Father, forgive me for saying the words I did in anger, shaming him for his poverty and blaming him for mine, putting the idea into his head.
Forgive him.
Forgive him.
He didn't know what he was doing!
Let him go, Commandant.
He'll be punishing himself for the rest of his days... and I with him.
That's not in my power... - He won't harm you again.
Dan!
Do you think the Tans'll let him alone? They'll drag everything out of him.
His fear will drive him to them, make him a weapon who'll destroy us all.
I'll take him away.
I swear, I will!
Please, Katie.
Please!
You're the one that's been hurt.
I'm not the kind of girl you are. But there was a time when I was.
And I love Gypo no less for being what I am.
And I can see by your eyes that... you love him too.
Suppose it was his life you were begging for.
Wouldn't you be wanting mercy then?
And won't you be giving it to me now?
A sinner.
Where's Gypo now?
Poor lad.
Listen.
He's in my room, the other side of the church.
Tell me you'll give him a chance!
There's no harm in him. He didn't know what he was doing!
Miss McPhillip, for the sake of your own love, ask him to give my man a chance.
Katie, Katie. This is no time for sentiment.
This is war!
I tell you, I gave Gypo the benefit of every doubt, every chance.
He confessed.
I didn't pass sentence on him, the court did.
Don't you see how helpless I am?
Suppose it was his life you were begging for!
It is mine, and the lives of hundreds of other men.
Can't you see what you're asking?
I see you won't do it!
You won't!
Come on, now, Dennis. It was you that drew the match. Don't be afraid.
I'm not afraid.
Are you sure he's in there?
'Tis locked, I tell you.
Katie!
Katie!
I'll bl... I'll blow the lock off.
Yes. Sure, now.
Mother of God!
Bartly!
Gypo!
Gypo!
'Twas I informed on your son, Mrs. McPhillip.
Forgive me.
Ah, Gypo.
I forgive you.
You didn't know what you were doing.
You didn't know what you were doing.
Frankie!
Frankie!
Your mother forgives me!
The gentleman has not arrived?
No, he has not.
I'm afraid the dinner will be spoiled. What difference does it make?
It's too late to dine now.
Boy, will you page Mr. Otis B. Driftwood, please?
Paging Mr. Driftwood!
Mr. Driftwood!
Do me a favor and stop yelling my name all over this restaurant.
Do I go around yelling your name?
Mr. Driftwood!
Is your voice changing, or is somebody else paging me?
Mr. Driftwood!
Why, Mrs. Claypool, hello!
You invited me to dine with you at 7:00. It is now 8:00, and no dinner.
No dinner? I just had one of the biggest meals of my life... and no thanks to you, either.
I've been sitting right here since 7:00.
With your back to me. When I dine with a woman, I expect her to look at my face. - That's the price she has to pay.
Your check, sir.
$9.40? This is an outrage! If I were you, I wouldn't pay it.
What are we gonna have for dinner?
You've had your dinner.
All right, we'll have breakfast.
Waiter!
Have you got any milk-fed chicken? - Yes, sir.
Squeeze the milk out of one and bring me a glass.
Yes, sir.
Mr. Driftwood, three months ago, you promised to put me into society.
In all that time, you've done nothing but draw a very handsome salary.
You think that's nothing?
How many men do you think draw a handsome salary?
You can count them on the fingers of one hand, my good woman.
I'm not your good woman!
Don't say that, Mrs. Claypool.
I don't care what your past has been. To me, you'll always be my good woman, because I love you.
There. I didn't mean to tell you but you dragged it out of me. I love you.
That's hard to believe when I find you dining with another woman.
That woman? Do you know why I sat with her? Because she reminded me of you.
Really? - Of course.
That's why I'm here with you, because you remind me of you.
Your eyes, your throat, your lips... Everything about you reminds me of you... except you.
How do you account for that? She figures that out, she's good.
Mr. Driftwood, I think we'd better keep everything on a business basis.
Every time I get romantic with you, you want to talk business.
I don't know. There's something about me that brings out the business in all women.
All right, we'll talk business. You see that man eating spaghetti? - No.
You see the spaghetti, don't you?
Behind that spaghetti is none other than Herman Gottlieb... director of the New York Opera Company.
Do you follow me? - Yes.
Stop following me, or I'll have you arrested!
I've arranged for you to invest $200,000 in the New York Opera Company.
I don't understand.
Don't you see? You'll be a patron of the opera. You'll get into society.
You can marry me, and they'll kick you out of society... and all you've lost is $200,000.
Gottlieb. Allow me. Mrs. Claypool, Mr. Gottlieb.
I could go on all night, but it's tough on my suspenders.
Where was I?
What are you doing?
If you four people want to play bridge, don't mind me, go right ahead.
Mrs. Claypool, I'm so happy.
I just wanted to see if your rings were still there.
You're as charming as you are beautiful.
I'm afraid you've used that speech before, Mr. Gottlieb.
Now listen here, Gottlieb, making love to Mrs. Claypool is my racket. What you're after is $200,000.
Make it sound plausible, because incredible as it may seem... Mrs. Claypool isn't as big a sap as she looks.
How's that for lovemaking?
I think the Europeans do it better.
All right, Gottlieb, it's your turn. You take a whack at her... and keep it clean.
Mrs. Claypool, it is most generous of you to help us.
Now, you have, of course, heard of Rodolfo Lassparri.
Of course.
He is the greatest tenor since Caruso.
Tonight, with the money you so generously provide...
I sign Lassparri for the Opera Company.
He will be a sensation. All New York will be at your feet.
There's plenty of room.
And now, the opera awaits us. If you both will honor me by occupying my box.
I should be charmed.
And you, Mr. Driftwood?
I'll join up with you later.
Listen, Gottlieb, nix on the lovemaking, because I saw Mrs. Claypool first.
Of course, her mother really saw her first, but why bring the Civil War into this?
What are you doing in my costume? Take it off at once, do you hear?
Immediately.
Why, you... Take that off.
Take off that dress, do you hear me?
You dumb idiot. You do what I say, or I'll break your neck!
Do you hear me? Take off that dress. If I get my hands on you, you'll never hear the end of this!
You're no longer my dresser, you're fired!
Get out, do you hear me?
Out you go. And don't come back in here again.
Don't you care. You're lucky to be rid of him.
Good evening, Rosa.
Good evening, signore.
Tomasso, why don't you come in? I've been waiting for you.
Are they not beautiful, signorina? From Signor Lassparri.
I wouldn't wear them if they were the only flowers in the world.
Come in!
Not if you use that tone. Let's try the whole thing all over again. Only this time, try to be more cordial.
Come in.
That's better.
Let's try it once more.
No, Ricky. You're such a fool.
What was it you wanted to see me about?
I suppose I sent for you?
You meant to.
Didn't she, Marie?
It's the last night of the season, and I'm more in love with you than ever. - What will you do about it?
We have all summer to talk that over. - Tonight, we have to sing an opera.
You have to sing an opera. - I'm nothing but a glorified chorus man.
Don't say that.
I've got to say it. I've got something else to say.
What are you doing tonight, unless that ham Lassparri asked you first.
He has asked me first.
Just my luck.
But I'm having supper with you, Riccardo.
Hooray!
We'll have champagne, music, flowers...
Lassparri."
No flowers.
Fiorello!
Tony!
Where have you been all these weeks?
Here, there, different places. - Got some mail for me?
Mail for you? You don't work here.
Where am I gonna get my mail? I no work anyplace.
Tomasso!
Not so good. Don't be so glad.
I brought you present.
You got something for me, too? What do you got?
Where's Riccardo? All right.
What are you doing here?
I thought you were with the circus.
The circus? When was I with the circus?
I nearly forgot. That was a long time ago, last week.
Since then I have lots of jobs.
Your piano and my voice. All those years we studied at the conservatory, and what's come of it?
What's a matter with you?
We're still young. We've got our health.
You hear that? Someday, Riccardo, you're gonna be where Lassparri is.
When you were six years old, you sing better than Lassparri.
Maybe I was better at six than I am now.
You make me sick. You crazy. You sing better than he ever could sing and you know it.
I know it and you know it, but the public doesn't know it.
All right. We tell the public.
How?
What you need is a manager. A wise guy, somebody who's very smart.
I know just the man for you. - You do?
Who is it?
Me!
But you wouldn't make any money at it.
I'll break even. Just as long as I no lose nothing.
Is the opera over yet?
Not yet, signore, in a few minutes.
I told you to slow that nag down. On account of you, I nearly heard the opera.
Once around the park, and drive slowly. And none of your back talk.
You're still crazy about her? And she's crazy about you, too?
Even if she was, I couldn't ask her to marry me.
Don't worry. The manager, he'll fix everything.
Anyhow, we're together again... - you and me, just like old times.
Yeah, like old times.
Yeah, you bet my life.
If you pardon my saying so, Mrs. Claypool... Mr. Driftwood seems hardly the person to handle your business affairs.
I'm beginning to think the same thing.
I made it. How soon does the curtain go up?
The curtain, Mr. Driftwood, will go up again next season.
You've missed the entire opera.
I only missed it by a few minutes. I can go then?
Was I right? Isn't Lassparri the greatest tenor that ever lived?
He's superb. But what would you have to pay him?
What's the difference? He must sail with us tomorrow no matter what we pay. - He would be worth $1,000 a night.
How much?
What does he do?
What does he do, he sings.
You're willing to pay him $1,000 a night just for singing?
You can get a phonograph record of Minnie the Moocher for 75 cents.
For $1.25, you can get Minnie.
If you'll excuse me, Mrs. Claypool...
I think I had better arrange to see Lassparri immediately. - You are agreed, $1,000 a night?
Just as you think.
$1,000. There must be some way I can get a piece of this.
Wait. Why don't I sign Lassparri? I represent Mrs. Claypool.
But I represent the New York Opera Company.
Boy? Will you give my card to Signor Lassparri, please?
What is it? What do you want?
Rosa.
Yes, signore?
My good friend Herman Gottlieb is coming back to see me. How would you like to have supper with us?
I'm terribly sorry, Signor Lassparri, I already have an engagement.
I see.
That's too bad, because I have an idea... he's going to invite me to sing in New York.
And he may permit me to select my leading lady.
Are you sure you can't break your appointment?
I'm terribly sorry, signore.
What do you mean by humiliating me in front of those people?
You're fired, do you understand?
You big bully, why are you hitting that little bully?
Will you kindly let me handle my own affairs?
Get out.
What do you got to say to me?
Can you sleep on your stomach with such big buttons on your pajamas?
Why, you...
Nice work, I think you got him.
Smelling salts.
That will bring him to.
You're sorry for what you did? That shows a nice spirit.
Now he's coming along. He'll be fine now.
Get fresh with me, huh?
How do you do? - Hello.
What's the matter, mister?
We had an argument. He pulled a knife on me, so I shot him.
Do you mind if I...
Go right ahead. Plenty of room.
Two beers, bartender.
I'll take two beers, too.
Things seem to be getting better around the country.
I don't know. I'm a stranger here myself.
I came back here looking for somebody. You don't know who it is, do you?
It's a funny thing, it just slipped my mind.
I know. The greatest tenor in the world. That's what I'm after.
Why, I'm his manager.
Whose manager?
The greatest tenor in the world.
The fellow that sings at the opera here?
What's his name?
What do you care? I can't pronounce it. What do you want with him?
I want to sign him up for the New York Opera Company.
Do you know that America is waiting to hear him sing?
He can sing loud but he can't sing that loud.
I think I can get America to meet him halfway. Could he sail tomorrow?
You pay him enough money, he could sail yesterday. How much you pay him?
I don't know.
Let's see, $1,000 a night. I'm entitled to a small profit.
How about $10 a night?
$10?
I'll take it.
All right, but remember, I get 10% for negotiating the deal.
Yes, and I get 10% for being the manager. How much does that leave?
Well, that leaves him $8.
He sends $5 home to his mother.
That leaves $3.
Can he live in New York on $3?
Like a prince. Of course, he won't be able to eat, but he can live like a prince.
However, out of that $3, he'll have to pay an income tax.
Yes, there's a federal tax, a state tax, and a city tax... a street tax, and a sewer tax.
How much does this come to?
I figure if he doesn't sing too often, he can break even.
All right, we take it.
All right, fine. Here are the contracts.
You just put his name at the top, and you sign at the bottom.
No need of you reading that because these are duplicates.
Yeah. Is a duplicate.
Duplicates?
I say, they're duplicates.
Don't you know what duplicates are?
Sure, those five kids up in Canada.
I wouldn't know about that. I haven't been in Canada in years.
Go ahead and read it.
What does it say?
Go on and read it.
You read it.
All right, I'll read it to you.
Can you hear?
I haven't heard anything yet. - You say anything?
I haven't said anything worth hearing.
That's why I didn't hear anything.
That's why I didn't say anything.
Can you read?
I can read, but I can't see it.
Don't seem to have it in focus here.
If my arms were a little longer, I could read it.
You haven't got a baboon in your pocket, have you?
Here we are. Now I've got it.
Pay particular attention to this first clause because it's most important.
It says, " The party of the first part shall be known in this contract...
How do you like that? That's pretty neat, eh?
No, it's no good.
What's the matter with it?
I don't know.
The party of the first part shall be known in this contract... "as the party of the first part."
Sounds a little better this time.
It grows on you. Would you like to hear it once more?
Just the first part.
What? "The party of the first part"?
No. The first part of "the party of the first part."
It says, " The first part of the party of the first part...
shall be known in this contract as the first part of the party... "Shall be known in this contract..."
Why should we quarrel about this? We'll take it out.
Yeah. It's too long anyhow.
Now what do we got left?
I got about a foot and a half.
It says, " The party of the second part shall be known in this contract... "as the party of the second part."
I don't know about that.
Now what's the matter?
I don't like the second party either.
You should have come to the first party. We didn't get home till around 4:00 a.m. I was blind for three days.
Why can't the first part of the second party... be the second part of the first party? Then you got something.
Look, rather than go through that again, what do you say...
Fine.
I've got something you're bound to like. You'll be crazy about it. No.
I don't like it.
You don't like what?
Whatever it is, I don't like it.
Don't let's break up an old friendship over a thing like that. Ready?
Okay.
The next part, I don't think you're going to like.
Your word's good enough for me.
Is my word good enough for you?
I should say not.
That takes out two more clauses.
The party of the eighth part..."
No, that's no good.
The party of the ninth..."
How is it my contract is skinnier than yours?
I don't know, you must have been out on a tear last night. - We're all set now, aren't we? - Sure.
Just you put your name down there, and then the deal is legal.
I forgot to tell you, I can't write.
That's all right, there's no ink in the pen. - But it's a contract, isn't it? - Sure.
We've got a contract, no matter how small it is.
Wait. What does this say here? That?
That's the usual clause. That's in every contract.
That just says, " If any of the parties...
participating in this contract... "are shown not to be in their right mind... "the entire agreement is automatically nullified."
I don't know.
It's all right. That's in every contract. That's what they call a sanity clause.
You can't fool me. There ain't no Sanity Claus.
You win the white carnation.
I'll give this to Riccardo.
Could you tell me where Signor Lassparri is?
Sure. There's Lassparri.
Lassparri?
Then whom did I sign?
You signed Riccardo Baroni. That's my man.
Signor Lassparri, what happened?
Speak to me. It's me, it's Gottlieb.
What is this now?
How early the fruit is falling this season.
Are you sure you have everything, Otis?
I've never had any complaints yet.
Here you are, on your way to America and fame.
Riccardo, I'm going to miss you.
How do you think I feel about it?
Miss Castaldi, ready for the big trip?
Mr. Gottlieb.
This is Riccardo Baroni of the Opera Company.
How do you do?
Did you say Baroni?
Is it as funny as all that?
Mr. Otis B. Driftwood seems to think you have quite a voice.
He has, Mr. Gottlieb, really he has, a wonderful voice.
Yes, really I have.
That's interesting.
Come on, Riccardo.
No, thanks.
Come on, Ricky!
Signor Lassparri. - Yes? - Will you give us a farewell song?
My dear friends, I am so sorry, I must be excused... but I have a slight touch of laryngitis.
Where's Rosa? - Yes, Rosa!
Why should I sing for them when I'm not being paid for it?
Yes, of course I'll sing.
Mr. Gottlieb.
Hasn't he a wonderful voice? There must be a place for him in New York.
Not a bad voice. Someday, perhaps, when he has made a reputation.
All visitors ashore! Rosa!
We've come to say goodbye.
All right.
Come on!
All right, take it away.
Have I got time to go back and pay my hotel bill?
Sorry. Too late.
That suits me fine.
That's mine. A trunk thief?
Where you going with that?
Suite number 58, sir.
Fifty-eight?
Let's go.
What's the idea?
I'm sorry, sir.
Sorry, my eye. Look at that fender. It's all bumped out of shape.
You'll pay for this, my good man.
Let me see your number.
Thirty-two? You got any insurance?
Are you insured? - No, sir.
You're just the fellow I want to see.
I have an accident policy that protects you no matter what happens.
If you lose a leg, we'll look for it. All this will cost you is...
What have you got there?
$1. Here you are.
Let's go.
Suite 58, and don't go over 20 miles an hour.
Say, was that three fellows or one fellow with three beards?
Hi, Gottlieb, always beating around the bush.
Wait a minute.
Anything I can do?
Just a little homesick. - That's funny.
I happen to have the greatest prescription for homesickness you ever saw.
A fellow gave it to me just before the boat sailed. Here's the prescription, and take it every two hours.
I'm going out and getting another prescription.
Hello, toots.
Hello.
Say, pretty classy layout you got here.
Do you like it?
Twin beds. You little rascal, you.
One of those is a day bed.
A likely story.
Have you read any good books lately?
Mr. Driftwood, will you please get off the bed?
What would people say?
They'd say you're a very lucky woman. Will you please shut up so I can continue reading?
No, I will not shut up. And will you kindly get up at once?
All right, I'll go.
I'll make you another proposition. Let's go in my room and discuss the situation.
What situation?
What situations have you got?
I most certainly will not go to your room.
Okay. Then I'll stay here.
All right.
I'll come, but get out.
Shall we say 10 minutes?
Yes, 10 minutes. Anything, but go.
Because if you're not there in 10 minutes, I'll be back here in 11.
With squeaky shoes on.
Wait a minute. This can't be my room.
Yes, sir. Suite number 58, sir.
Fifty-eight? That's an awful big number for a birdcage this size.
Wouldn't it be simpler if you just put the stateroom in the trunk?
Say, who is responsible for installing me in this telephone booth?
Mr. Gottlieb picked it out for you, sir.
Gottlieb? That's awfully decent of him. Awfully decent.
Did he pick out the whole room or just the porthole?
I'm sure you'll find it cozy, sir.
Cozy is hardly the word.
Anything else, sir? Yes.
Tomorrow you can take the trunk out and I'll go in.
Hello, boss. What are you doing here?
Hello. This makes it a perfect voyage. - I'm sorry.
It is your trunk.
I don't remember packing you boys.
Remember Riccardo Baroni, the greatest tenor in the world? You nearly signed him up once.
Sure. I just delivered a letter for you. How are you?
Good. Just a little cramped.
We're still in the harbor. As soon as we get out in the ocean, there'll be plenty of room.
Isn't that my shirt? - I don't know.
I found it in the trunk.
Then it couldn't be mine. It's nice seeing you again. But I was expecting my other suit.
Yeah. Took up too much room, so we sold it.
Did you get anything for it?
$1.40.
That's my suit, all right.
Say, it's lucky I left another shirt in this drawer.
That can't be my shirt. My shirt doesn't snore.
Don't wake him up. He's got insomnia. He's sleeping it off.
That's as grisly a looking object as I've ever seen.
Get him up out of there.
He certainly is sleeping.
I wish you fellows would explain this thing to me.
It's very simple.
You see, Riccardo, he's in love with Rosa. Rosa, she go to New York. We want to go to New York, too.
Without money, what'll you do in New York?
I can sing. There must be some place for me to work. Besides, I can be near Rosa.
That's the main thing. You won't give us away, will you?
No, but you fellows have got to get out of here.
I've got a date with a lady in a few minutes... and you know the old saying:
Two's company, five's a crowd."
We go, but we want something to eat. We no eat all day. We're hungry.
We'll discuss the food situation later.
We get food, or we don't go.
I know I never should have met you fellows. Okay. But promise to scram out after you've eaten.
I'll get the steward. You fellows be quiet. Remember, you're stowaways.
We no say nothing. - All right.
Now, just put that bag of Jell-O over here.
Wouldn't it be simpler if you had him stuffed?
He's no olive.
I'll go and get the steward.
Is it the door of the room, or am I in the trunk?
Over here.
Be quiet, now. Don't make any noise.
We no say nothing.
I'll get the steward.
Steward!
Stew! - Yes, sir.
I say, stew... - Yes, sir.
What's for dinner? - Anything you like.
Tomato juice, orange juice, grape juice, pineapple juice...
Turn off the juice before I get electrocuted.
All right, let me have one of each.
And two fried eggs, two poached eggs... two scrambled eggs, and two medium-boiled eggs.
And two hard-boiled eggs.
And two hard-boiled eggs.
Make that three hard-boiled eggs.
And some roast beef: Rare, medium, well-done, and overdone.
And two hard-boiled eggs.
Make that three hard-boiled eggs.
And eight pieces of French pastry.
With two hard-boiled eggs.
And two hard-boiled eggs.
Make that three hard-boiled eggs.
And one duck egg.
Have you got any stewed prunes?
Yes, sir.
Give them some black coffee. That'll sober them up.
And two hard-boiled eggs.
It's either foggy out, or make that 12 more hard-boiled eggs.
Rush that along. The faster it comes, the faster this convention will be over. Yes, sir.
Do they allow tipping on the boat?
Yes, sir!
Have you got two fives?
Yes, sir.
Then you won't need the 10 cents I was gonna give you.
That's fine. If that steward is deaf and dumb... - he'll never know you're in here.
That's all right.
Yes?
We've come to make up your room.
Are those my hard-boiled eggs?
I can't tell until they get in the room.
Come in, girls. Leave all hope behind.
Work fast because you gotta get out in 10 minutes.
Tomasso. Wake up. They're going to fix the bed.
I'd like two pillows on that bed there.
There's a slight misunderstanding here.
I said the girls had to work fast, not your friend.
He's still asleep.
You know, he does better asleep than I do awake.
Yeah, he always sleeps that way. - Now he's half-asleep.
Yes, he's half-asleep in a half Nelson.
All right, come on.
I'm the engineer. I'm here to turn off the heat.
You can start right in on him.
Wake up, Tomasso. Tomasso, we're going to eat soon.
You know, if it wasn't for Gottlieb, I wouldn't have got this room.
Just hold him there a second. - Yes?
Did you want a manicure?
No. Come on in.
I hadn't planned on a manicure, but on a journey like this... you ought to have every convenience you can get.
Listen, I'm getting the manicure. Get out of here, will you?
Did you want your nails long or short?
You better make them short. It's getting kind of crowded in here.
I don't know. This isn't the way I pictured an ocean voyage.
I always visualized myself in a steamer chair with a steward bringing me bouillon.
Come on, Riccardo.
You couldn't get bouillon in unless they brought it in through a keyhole.
I'm the engineer's assistant.
I had a premonition you were going to show up.
The engineer's over there in the corner. You can chop your way right through.
Is it my imagination, or is it getting crowded in here?
I got plenty of room.
Yes?
Is my Aunt Minnie in here?
You can come in and prowl around if you want to. If she isn't in here, you can probably find somebody just as good.
Could I use your phone?
Use the phone? - I'll lay you even money you can't get in.
How do you do?
This boat will be in New York before you get to that phone.
I came to mop up.
Just the woman I'm looking for. Come right ahead.
You have to start on the ceiling. It's the only place that's not occupied.
You can clean my shoes if you want to. - Operator.
Tell Aunt Minnie to send up a bigger room, will you?
Steward.
Come right ahead.
The food! - We've been waiting all afternoon for you.
I want my Aunt Minnie!
Ladies and gentlemen... it's with great pleasure I welcome you all on this, the final night of the voyage.
I cannot let the evening pass... without paying a little tribute to our distinguished guests of honor:
The three greatest aviators in the world.
Three greatest aviators, but notice they're traveling by boat.
We are honored by your presence, gentlemen.
Thank you.
Thank you, Captain.
Do you rumba?
Why, yes. Of course I do.
Take a rumba from one to ten.
Mr. Claypool went to his reward three years ago.
And left you all alone.
All alone.
With $8 million.
$8 million.
Gottlieb, you're just wasting your time. If Mrs. Claypool wants to marry a fortune hunter, she's got me.
Fortune hunter?
In fact, you can't call me a fortune hunter.
Because when I proposed to her, I thought she only had $7 million.
But the extra million never interfered with my feelings for her.
If you had any real feeling for me... you'd stop associating with the riffraff I've seen you with.
You mean Gottlieb?
I mean those two uncouth men I saw you around the opera house with.
I'm grateful they're not on board the boat.
Why, have they slipped off?
Sit down.
Come on, we find something to eat.
You think it's safe? If they catch us, they'll deport us.
What will we lose? If we're deported, they'll feed us. Come on, we'll take a chance.
Does it mean nothing to you that I'm the world's greatest singer?
But I love to hear you sing, Rodolfo.
No. Let me put it this way.
I love you. I adore you. I would die for you.
Now do you understand?
I'm afraid I don't.
The whole thing is very simple. When he says he's the greatest singer, it means he loves you. Personally, I don't believe either statement.
There may be something in what you say.
I'll tell you something confidentially.
The only tenor I could ever stand was a fellow by the name... of Riccardo Baroni.
Ever hear of him?
Riccardo. I wonder where he is right now.
Probably roaming over the countryside someplace.
Riccardo always loved the open. He never could stand being cooped up.
He still doesn't like it.
Tomasso, you feel better now?
And, you, Riccardo, how do you feel?
After a meal like that? Great. I could sing my head off.
That's the spirit.
Stop that! Get away from those instruments! - What are you doing here?
Please let him play.
Let him play.
It's all right with me. Let him play.
Those men can't be passengers on this boat. - They must be stowaways.
Stowaways?
We'll soon find out.
What are you... Are you crazy?
You got it. Fine. Now you go first and see if it's safe.
Hold on. Out you go.
You're all right, but the boat's too far away.
What's he doing now?
I think he's hanging himself.
Gentlemen, it gives me great pleasure to...
Quiet.
Our guests have asked me to represent them and to act as their interpreter.
If you'll follow me, I'll take you to their cabin. If they're still in it, very few of us will come out alive.
Pardon me. Our guests are having their shredded wheat. They'll be right out.
Gentlemen.
Kind friends..." - Give me that.
Let's cut this short.
The whole thing is very simple. You're going to City Hall. The Mayor's gonna make another speech.
So, my friends, as mayor of this great city...
I take pleasure in inviting our distinguished visitors... to tell us something about their achievement.
What'll I say?
Tell them you're not here.
Suppose they don't believe me?
They'll believe you when you start talking.
Friends...
Talk fast. I see a man in the crowd with a rope.
How we happen to come to America is a great story, but I no tell that.
When we first started out... we got no idea you give us this grand reception.
We don't deserve it. When I say we don't deserve it... believe me, I know what I'm talking about.
That's a novelty.
Now I tell you how we fly to America.
The first time, we get halfway across when we run out of gasoline. We got to go back.
Then I take twice as much gasoline. This time, we were just about to land, maybe 3 feet... when, what do you think, we run out of gasoline again.
Back we go and get more gas. This time, I take plenty gas.
We get halfway over, when what do you think happened?
We forgot the airplane.
So we sit down and talk it over. Then I get the great idea... we no take gasoline.
We no take the airplane. We take steamship.
And that, friends, is how we fly across the ocean.
I'm going out to arrange your bail.
This is the mayor again.
And now I take great pleasure in introducing another of our heroes... who will tell you something of his exploits.
Of course.
From now on, it's every man for himself.
I would suggest you make your speech a little more direct than your brother's.
What will you give me to set fire to your beard?
We're all right as long as the water supply holds out.
Please, the radio. Your speech.
They may have to build a dam in the back of him.
I think these fellas are phonies.
What's that you say?
You heard me.
You hear what they say? They've never been so insulted, and they refuse to stay. No, please.
Tell them he didn't mean it.
Of course, you know this means war.
Now see what you've done.
I'm sorry. I'm awful sorry.
I apologize, and I hope you're not offended.
Go on!
Come on, get him.
What are you singing about?
What will you do?
First, I'll throw those two gorillas out. That goes for you, too.
Thought I got rid of those mugs when I sold my trunk.
Kiddies, come on, everything is piping hot.
Breakfast.
Good morning.
Oh, boy, I'm hungry.
Read that. That will take away your appetite.
That only makes me hungrier.
Come on. You're going to be late for jail.
Those certainly went like hot cakes.
You know, this isn't the way I anticipated my breakfast.
I'm certainly getting enough of you fellas.
I no like cupcakes.
No.
Say, wait a minute.
That was a two-bit cigar.
Bad enough I have to smoke those things without eating them.
Get out.
Glad I didn't bring my vest.
I forgot to tell you. He ate your vest last night for dessert.
He's half goat.
Yes, and that's giving him all the best of it.
Thought I had another cigar on me.
He's going to smell like a vegetable salad when he gets through with that.
I've been looking forward to this breakfast. I've been waiting all morning. This is how it wound up.
I'll take a quart.
A little of that, anyway.
Why don't you fellows be nice? Get out of here before I get arrested.
I'd like to stay and see that.
What's that?
If it's a policeman, knock once more.
That's good enough for me.
Scram, get out.
Come in.
Yes? - You remember me.
I'm Henderson, plainclothesman.
You look more like an old clothes man to me.
Nice place.
It's comfortable.
You live here all alone?
Just me and my memories. - I'm practically a hermit.
A hermit. I notice the table is set for four.
That's nothing. My alarm clock is set for 8:00. That doesn't prove a thing.
A wise guy.
I'll take a little look around.
Hey, you.
Coming.
What's a hermit doing with four beds?
You see those first three beds? - Yes.
Last night, I counted 5,000 sheep on those beds.
So I had to have another bed. You wouldn't want me to sleep with the sheep, would you?
Who are you talking to? - I was talking to myself.
There's nothing you can do about it. - I've had three of the best doctors.
I certainly heard somebody talk.
Sheer folly on your part.
What's this?
That's a fire escape. That's a table. This is a room.
There's the door leading out. I wish you would use it. - I want to be alone.
You'll be alone when I throw you in jail.
Isn't there a song like that, Henderson?
He's coming around the other way. Get inside, quick.
It means a stretch at the big house if he catches you. Don't let him catch you.
Hey, you!
Coming.
What became of that fourth bed?
What are you referring to, Colonel?
Last time I was in this room, there were four beds here.
Please. I'm not interested in your private life, Henderson.
Say, what's that bed doing here?
I don't see it doing anything.
There's something funny going on here.
But I'll get to the bottom of it.
Stairs right there.
Look out! - Be on your guard. - Hey, you!
Coming.
Am I crazy, or are there only two beds here?
Which question do you want me to answer first?
How did those two beds get together?
You know how those things are. They breed like rabbits.
Let me tell you something. I'll solve this if I have to stay here all night.
If you stay, you'll have to bring a bed.
One bed! One bed?
What are you talking about?
Now they're all gone. I know I am crazy.
I beg your pardon, I must be in the wrong room. You thought you could come to America without me?
You fool. You dear fool.
Because I love you, you call me a fool. There may be something in that.
What are you doing here?
Easiest thing in the world. An open window, a detective, and here I am.
Riccardo, you shouldn't have. They'll only send you back again. - Perhaps even put you in jail.
I don't care, darling. It's worth it.
Suppose I go to Mr. Gottlieb. Maybe he'd intercede for you.
Gottlieb couldn't do anything. Besides, Lassparri's got to him first.
But there must be something we can do.
Who is it?
It is I. Rodolfo.
Come in.
Do you mind my dropping down?
No, of course not.
Only, I was just going to take a nap.
Rosa, why do you do this to me?
Do what, Rodolfo?
Whenever I want to see you, you make some excuse. You will not dine with me, ride with me, or even take a walk with me.
But, Rodolfo, you know how busy I am. My debut in America.
Have you forgotten that it was I... who brought about your debut in America?
No, I haven't forgotten.
Then why do you treat me this way?
Rodolfo, I must ask you to leave.
Come now, my dear. Be sensible.
If you ask me, I think she's being very sensible.
Baroni.
Now I understand. You did not tell me you had a previous engagement.
Now you know it.
And I apologize. Now, permit me to withdraw.
In a boudoir, two are company, three a crowd.
Just what do you mean by that?
Please, Riccardo.
Surely I have made my meaning clear.
Riccardo!
You have not heard the end of this.
I'm sure I haven't.
You may be very sure.
Good afternoon, Mr. Driftwood.
Good afternoon.
Ready for the opening tonight?
Am I?
That's all right, boys. I was young myself once.
Good morning, Mr. Driftwood.
How are all my songbirds?
Fine.
Splendid. Sing well tonight, now.
Waiting for you, Mr. Driftwood. Step right in.
Thank you, Otto.
Nice day, isn't it?
It has its points.
Here you are, sir.
Thank you, Otto.
That's all right, Mr. Driftwood.
What's all this? What's going on here?
You mean, what's coming off here?
You can't do that.
Wanna bet?
But that's my office.
I'm taking orders from Mr. Gottlieb. Go see him about it.
I'll see Mr. Gottlieb, and I'll break you, my fine fellow. Go see Mr. Gottlieb.
What's the meaning of this? If you think that I'm going to...
If you're busy, I'll return later.
Just a minute, Mr. Driftwood. We have some news for you. News?
For me?
Mrs. Claypool has decided to dispense with your services immediately.
Dispense with my services? She hasn't even had them.
I warned you, if you continued to associate with those men... everything would be over between us.
And you've been associating with them.
How do you know? You couldn't find them.
You've disgraced me, and the entire Opera Company.
As Mrs. Claypool's new business manager... I must request you to get out and stay out.
Just a minute. You can't fire me without two weeks' salary. That's in section 10-A of my contract.
I find that you have overdrawn your salary for the next six months.
In that case, I'll take one week's salary.
You'll take nothing. Get out.
If that's your best offer, I'll get out, but I'm not making a nickel on it.
As for you, Mrs. Claypool, I withdraw my offer of marriage.
And that goes for you, too.
The thanks I get for working my fingers to the bone.
All right, Otto.
Just a minute. This car is for officials. Take the stairs.
The stairs?
Why, that's four flights.
I can't walk all that distance.
All right. I'll help you.
Now there's room.
That's all I needed.
I'm certainly glad I met you boys.
First you get me fired, then you get me thrown out of my hotel... and finally you push me off a park bench.
There's one consolation. Nothing more can happen to me.
Get off of the grass.
I was wrong.
People drink too much water, anyhow.
I'm certainly glad you came along.
When I met you boys, I had a good job and was about to marry a rich widow.
Now I can't even sit on the grass.
I'd give you my seat, but I'm sitting here.
That's an offer. I'd like to think it over for a couple of days. Where can I find you?
Don't worry. Wherever you are, you'll find us.
I'm sick of that. Let's meet somewhere else.
It's Rosa.
At least I can get my bench back.
Don't feel so badly, Riccardo.
I can't feel cheerful about being such a hoodoo to you.
We all make things bad for you.
What's the matter?
What do you think? Lassparri. He's get Rosa fired.
Lassparri?
He won't let her sing tonight.
What do you know about that?
We've got all day to think of some plan. And believe me, the way I think, it'll take all day.
Good evening. Plenty for you tonight.
Thank you.
What does this mean?
Just the man I want to see.
Gottlieb, these are the worst cigars I ever smoked.
Yes, and your ice isn't cold enough, either.
Get out of here, all of you. I shall send for the police.
Just a minute.
I'll tell you what we came here for.
We make you a proposition.
So you're willing to give yourselves up?
Yes, if you let Rosa sing.
I'm managing director, and Rosa does not sing.
But the rest of your proposition... giving yourselves up, that rather appeals to me.
Give me police headquarters. Sergeant Henderson, please.
Hello, toots.
What are you doing here? This is Mr. Gottlieb's box.
He couldn't come, so he gave me his ticket. And he couldn't get dressed, so he gave me his clothes.
Shorty, will you toss up that kelly?
Attaboy. Here. Get yourself a stogy.
Who's ahead?
Open the door.
Get me police headquarters.
Mrs. Claypool, have you seen Mr. Gottlieb? No.
Isn't he backstage?
He's disappeared. We can't find him anywhere.
You didn't look in the right place.
He was to make a speech before the curtain went up.
That's the cue. You'd better say something.
But I never made a speech in my life.
All right, I'll take care of it.
Ladies and gentlemen... I guess that takes in most of you.
This is the opening of a new opera season.
A season made possible by the generous checks of Mrs. Claypool.
I'm sure the familiar strains of Verdi's music will come back to you tonight... and Mrs. Claypool's checks will probably come back in the morning.
Tonight marks the American debut of Rodolfo Lassparri.
Signor Lassparri comes from a very famous family.
His mother was a well-known bass singer.
His father was the first man to stuff spaghetti with bicarbonate of soda... thus causing and curing indigestion at the same time.
Now, on with the opera. Let joy be unconfined.
Let there be dancing in the streets... drinking in the saloons, and necking in the parlor.
Play, Don.
I'll take this side.
It's none of my business... but I think there's a brace of woodpeckers in the orchestra.
Don't give up, boys. The cavalry is coming.
I'll see you later.
What are you doing?
It's all right. It's just the Tarzan in me.
That Schweinehund.
Peanuts! Get your fresh roasted peanuts, folks!
They're nice and hot! Get your peanuts!
Here you are!
There you are, you...
What are you laughing at?
Those clothes don't fit you.
You're getting to be a good shot, Tomasso.
The opera starts. Now we really go to work.
The curtain's up.
They've started. - Now, don't worry.
Someone open the door here!
Let me out of here!
Herr Gottlieb.
Where are they? Where did they go? - What?
What," he asks me.
Did a couple of men come up here? - What?
What?" All I get is "what."
How would you like to feel the way she looks?
That is Driftwood's voice. - I want him put out of the opera house.
Yes, sir.
That's right. You go talk to him.
We know he's in the audience someplace.
Where's Mr. Gottlieb?
The other side of the stage.
Come on, boys.
What was that? High "C" or vitamin "D"?
What's the matter? What happened here? Mr. Gottlieb!
Here, give me a hand.
Where are those men?
Did you catch them? No, sir.
I'm sorry. They're still out there.
Still out there?
I have an idea. Get me two gypsy costumes at once.
Now we're getting somewhere.
I will not sing unless they are put off there.
Yes, sir.
A battleship in II Trovatore!
Stop! Don't you do...
Herr Gottlieb! Lassparri, he's disappeared. What?
Then we haven't even a tenor.
Mr. Gottlieb.
You are Baroni. - That's who I am.
Get into a costume quickly.
What?
I want you to sing.
But I have no reputation, Mr. Gottlieb.
Besides, I couldn't sing with a strange Leonora.
I've been rehearsing with Miss Castaldi.
So that's it.
That's it exactly.
All right. Get them two costumes at once. Quick.
You hear that? That's real singing.
What? - Get off! Is this the opera house?
Arrest those men, and this one, too.
It's about time.
Lassparri, where have you been? Been?
Do you know what they did to me?
I'll sing them an encore that they'll never forget.
Never in my life have I received such treatment. They threw an apple at me.
Watermelons are out of season.
Rosa, Baroni, get out there quick. No.
I'm under arrest, Mr. Gottlieb.
What's that?
If they're arrested, I ought to be, too. I can't sing if I'm arrested.
What do we do? We must have them.
They'll save the entire season.
Well, what is it you want?
Just a minute. Let me handle this.
Quick! What do you want?
First, call off that police dog.
All right, anything.
These men are in this country under false pretenses, and I'll do my duty.
I'll be responsible for them.
Besides, they came over here with Mr. Driftwood. Mr. Driftwood is an employee of the Opera Company.
Since when?
Since Baroni started singing. Wait till I get a hold of that elevator operator.
All right, anything. Please, go out and sing.
Wait a minute. Before he sings, you gotta sign a contract, and I get 10%.
Yes, and I get 10%, too.
Now, where were we?
The party of the 10th part..."
The party of the 11th part..."
THE LOWER DEPTHS was awarded the 1936 Louis Delluc Prize for Best French Film of the Year.
THE LOWER DEPTHS
I'd never ask you for accounts. We aren't shopkeepers.
You serve your country, dear Baron, with true patriotic zeal.
But money is missing. Too much.
I know it was used for the common good, but the loss of 30,000 rubles is quite regrettable.
Someone less tolerant might ask for explanations, or be shocked that you have no memory of the loan.
You've something in mind, but it's still quite worrying.
A secret matter, you may insist.
But my dear Baron, our secret funds are not inexhaustible, alas.
Despite our long friendship, I fear I can no longer turn a blind eye.
My dear Baron, I trust you will not take this amiss.
Thank you.
Is that you, Pépel?
Yes, it's me.
I thought Kostylyov would never go to sleep.
Does the money he cheats us out of keep him awake?
You'll be glad to have him tomorrow.
Why tomorrow?
As if you didn't know.
Your big job is tonight, isn't it?
At the mansion. That's none of your business.
Are you hiding something from me?
You're wrong. I give you good advice.
What would you do without us to buy what you steal?
You and your husband profit as well.
I take the risks, and you get the money.
You know it'll all be ours one day.
Kostylyov's old. He won't live forever.
We'll go somewhere nice, just the two of us.
We'll start a new life.
And no one will know our past.
There's no point in daydreaming about us.
You don't love me anymore.
I'm warning you, don't you dare leave me!
I'd rather see you rot in prison than go off with someone else.
If I go to jail, you and your husband won't be far behind me.
No one will believe you.
We have friends on the police force.
Good night, Pépel.
Good night.
Be careful tonight.
Don't worry. We northerners aren't easy to catch.
Don't treat it like a walk in the park.
Alyoshka's coming.
So what? He'll wake up the old man.
I told that rascal to never come back.
Come on.
Hey, lodgers!
Hey, lodgers!
Hey, lodgers!
Is that you, Natasha?
Sorry. I'm a polite guy.
I meant to wake old Kostylyov.
He gets the money, but I got you!
You've been out boozing again.
You know me.
Aren't you ashamed? You know, I am who I am.
If people don't like it, too bad.
My boss gave me the sack, but I don't give a damn.
What's a boss, anyway? A simple misunderstanding!
Go to bed.
Wait. Not yet.
I wrote a jolly little funeral march. Wanna hear it?
Be quiet!
I want to tell the world!
No one's listening right now. Tell them tomorrow.
I won't be drunk then. I'll have nothing to say.
No one will mind. Go downstairs.
Go on.
Natasha, your eyes are like stars.
Off to bed you go.
Is that you?
Were you looking for me?
Yes, it's me.
And here you are, the two of you.
Nice and cozy.
Vassilissa!
Bitch! Damned bitch!
Forgive me, Lord.
Vassilissa, you drive me to sin.
You make me angry.
You make me swear.
I've looked everywhere for you.
You should be in bed, but you're out here on the stairs.
Tramp!
Filthy animal!
Clear out.
Clear out, I said.
I'm the boss around here.
You clear out, thief, or I'll have you arrested.
Clear out, or I'll strangle you!
Help me! Help!
One more dent.
If the boss grumbles, I'll get you another.
You dropped it on purpose.
No, I'm just clumsy.
You're clumsy, eh?
Lucky for me.
Otherwise, the way I was choking him... -
Don't touch me!
You're revolting. Sleep with my sister, I don't care.
Steal if you want. But don't touch me.
You're too young to understand.
One thing I do know: Men like you are despicable.
I'd like to explain, but I've got a job waiting.
I hope you get caught.
You know,
God doesn't favor the prayers of his saints.
Good night, Natasha.
Still up and about, Nastia?
I get my rest on my feet.
Aren't you fed up, out here all alone?
Aren't you fed up with what you do?
It's when I'm here that it gets me.
Everything seems fine, and then suddenly, it's like a chill comes over me and I've had enough.
It's about time.
Stand up straight.
You stood me up last night.
You're still thinking about that?
You asked me to dinner.
I didn't have enough left to buy you a sandwich.
How about tonight? - Tonight is different.
I'll win, and we'll go wherever you like.
Lend me 1,000 rubles.
At the moment I need them myself.
But if you win?
Later, dear child.
Banco.
Good evening, Baron.
Good evening.
I regret to say this, but perhaps you shouldn't play tonight.
Why is that?
Please understand, your debt is... -
That's precisely why I'm here. We'll settle that tonight.
He who pays his debts grows rich.
You're dining with him? What about me?
Silly, when that guy has money, he throws it around.
He's crazy.
And if he loses?
I won't go.
How will you know?
It's easy to tell.
Whether he wins or loses, he always leaves calmly.
He takes out a cigarette and puts it in his mouth.
If he's won, he lights it. If not, he's so nervous he can't light it.
Baron, may I give you a bit of advice?
Please do.
Don't gamble anymore.
Impossible, my dear sir.
Banco tonight, my dear Baron?
Certainly, my dear Count.
Shall we play?
I'd love to. Allow me to repay... -
It was 10,000 rubles, correct?
There's no hurry.
Debt of honor.
The bank has 16,000.
Shall we, Count?
With pleasure.
Banco.
Four.
Eight.
Excuse me.
The clock strikes midnight in the city
The rich sleep in their featherbeds
The rats scurry through the empty streets
The crooks set out on a job
They go calmly about their work
Armed with revolvers and knives
All trades are equal on this earth
Each has his hour and his task
When stealing is how you live
When you steal or murder
It's not the lark you might imagine
Pity the poor boys
At the serenading hour
When hearts rest easy
That's when they go to the guillotine
Cry for the poor boys
Excuse me.
Care to dance?
Did you lose?
I was lucky, but my opponent was even more so. Quite a game.
They say you're in trouble.
Is there nothing I can do?
It's odd. Suddenly I feel that we cared very much for each other.
Won't I see you again?
Good night, dear.
Pity.
Care to dance, miss?
Forgive me for keeping you waiting, Baron, but I dozed off.
You have the right.
These late hours aren't good for your health, Baron.
And his lordship didn't even return home for dinner.
The chicken was delicious.
You ate it?
Yes, sir.
Then why are you complaining?
A delegation of tradesmen came by.
They waited for two hours.
No matter.
Creditors' agents, too.
Again?
Tomorrow they'll take everything.
They're welcome to it.
It's no joking matter.
Felix, you can't imagine what a pest you're being.
His lordship is too kind.
Wouldn't you like an employer who paid you regularly?
Such employers are a dime a dozen, sir.
Then you'll remember me fondly when I'm gone?
Surely the baron is joking.
Anything else, sir?
Go to bed, Felix.
Good night, sir.
Good night, Felix.
Sleep well, sir.
I won't be easily awakened.
Please be so kind as to return my gun.
What?
I need it.
Sorry?
Careful, it's loaded. Put it down.
You won't call for help?
Call who?
Servants. The police.
What for?
You give your word?
If I understand correctly, you're here to rob me.
How funny.
You've got the wrong house. The banker lives next door.
Don't try to fool me.
I'm not.
You'll be lucky to find 50 rubles in the whole place.
You're welcome to the rest. It's no longer mine.
How about a shot for courage?
Yes?
Yes.
A drink between colleagues.
No joke?
You can trust me.
Then let's have another. It's good stuff.
Is your line of work profitable?
Well, it has its ups and downs.
Somehow the job that'll put you on easy street never pans out.
That's life, my friend.
Are you hungry?
I wouldn't want to impose.
But you'd rob me blind instead?
Hardly logical.
To hell with logic.
I was raised with certain manners.
We'll say you're stealing it, then. Better?
In that case, I don't mind at all.
Are you often hungry?
It happens.
Where do you sleep?
In a flophouse.
Happy with your life?
Sometimes.
When?
When?
I like it in the summer when it's nice and warm.
I like dozing in the grass.
Is that nice?
It can be.
Have you always lived like that?
Did you never think such a life wasn't worth the trouble?
Such a life?
It's the only life I know, sir.
You may drop the formalities.
With pleasure.
You lose.
What were we playing for?
Your place in paradise.
May I take one?
Help yourself.
There's only one left.
Then we'll split it.
Here.
Take my case, then.
If you insist.
Pépel, it's a pity I didn't meet you before.
Why didn't you rob me sooner?
If only I'd known.
Are we stopping?
I'm tired.
This is cozy. It's a shame to take it off.
Then keep it.
I couldn't.
They'd give me a hard time at the flophouse.
What are you doing?
Only servants are bothered by things like that.
Will we meet again?
Who knows?
I'd like to give you a souvenir. Choose something.
I couldn't.
None of it is mine anyway.
I'd like that.
Handsome beasts.
And they're detachable.
You like it? - Very much.
I've always liked horses.
It's the only thing I've ever won: a prize for horsemanship.
Can I really have it?
And anything else you like.
I don't care about the rest, but this I like.
This is the real deal!
It's bronze.
They didn't cheat you, buddy.
One stylish valet.
What style is it?
Stylish.
Three armchairs.
Take them away.
One large and two small carpets. Over there.
Four curtains.
One, two, three, four.
A chandelier with five arms.
Up there.
One gilded wooden console, marble top.
Over there. Come, gentlemen. I'll announce you to the baron.
One allegorical statue.
Allegorical. There.
...a tapestry by Gob... - I can't read it.
Gobelins!
Did the baron sleep well?
No, but what a pleasure to wake up.
The repossessors are here, sir.
I trust my egg will not be spoiled.
A messenger from the count is waiting, sir.
Show him in.
Now?
While there's still something to sit on.
Quite right, sir.
Shall I raise the blinds?
Tell me, Felix. Have you ever slept in the grass?
It would be beneath my dignity, sir.
If anyone says I have, be assured it is slander.
I didn't believe it, Felix.
In the grass!
Shall I show him in?
Show him in, Felix.
Please forgive so early a visit, Baron.
Please sit down.
The nature of my visit forbids it.
Then remain standing.
In view of last night's incident, the count hereby informs you your presence at the chancellery is no longer required.
What incident?
The 50,000 rubles you lost.
Oh, yes, the secret funds.
The noise is my furniture being sold.
The count intervened on your behalf to accord you an unlimited leave.
Without pay.
Thank him for me.
Did he mention the 10,000 rubles I repaid him?
Not to me.
Quite right. Reassure the Count.
I'll go away for a cure.
I'll send him the address of some quiet spot in case he too needs some rest.
Care for an egg?
Baron!
Good-bye, sir.
Show the gentleman out.
Sir, a policeman is here.
A burglar was arrested and he claims to know you.
His name's Pépel.
Pépel's been arrested?
Quick, help me dress.
It's you.
Yes, it is.
I wanted you to get caught. You said God wouldn't listen.
God is misinformed. I'm innocent. - Tell him yourself...
I don't believe you.
Don't believe me?
I swear he gave me those things.
Who?
A baron. He even invited me for dinner.
Really?
We had veal.
Yeah, roast veal.
When I left, he gave me a bronze statue.
The only thing he'd ever won: a prize for horsemanship.
A bronze statue?
The horses you saw on the table.
I saw them, all right... - I'm sure you stole them.
Believe what you want. I don't care.
Did Vassilissa send you?
You came on your own?
You felt sorry for Pépel the thief?
Sorry? You got what you deserved.
You were looking to go to prison.
I hope you never get out.
No use getting all worked up.
Good-bye.
Pépel!
What?
I brought you an orange and an apple, and some cigarettes.
I'd rather have had a kind word.
I can't.
Thanks anyway.
What is this chair?
The bailiff said that people must be left something to sit on.
Could they be more sensitive?
Apparently it's the law.
Good old Felix, I'll never return here.
I can hardly restrain my tears, sir.
You are impeccable, Felix.
Tell me, Felix, I owe you a lot in wages, but will all you've stolen from me be fair compensation?
Have no worries on that account, sir.
Don't bother to show me out... - I know the way.
Farewell, Felix.
In a way, Inspector, I don't mind landing in jail.
I'm actually glad.
Really?
Yes.
There are certain people I'm avoiding.
You know, bad influences.
You must be thinking,
A bad influence on Pépel? Must be real scum!"
You're absolutely right.
Worse. It's no laughing matter, I swear.
Really?
Oh, yes.
So on the one hand, I'd like to stay in prison, but on the other, I'd like to be released to prove to a certain person that I'm not what she thinks I am.
She's so stubborn. Worse than a mule!
How interesting.
Isn't it?
So, how about a good deed?
Drop the charges.
Just to really get her goat.
What is it?
Come closer.
We're in for a laugh. The baron is here in person.
Baron, you honor us too much, coming here on such a trivial matter.
We'll return your items after we've dealt with this man.
What items?
The cigarette case and the bronze.
Was something else stolen as well?
Nothing was stolen.
Kindly release my dear friend.
Hello, Pépel.
How are you, Baron?
I'd be happy to oblige, Baron, but this man told us such an unbelievable story... -
But no matter, Baron. You are free to go, dear sir.
Thank you, Baron.
Coming, Pépel?
Cigarette?
You're welcome.
Good-bye, Inspector.
Your humble servant, Baron.
Your tie and shoelaces.
Is everything in order?
That was kind of you, Baron.
Not so kind, really. Maybe you'll return the favor.
How could I ever?
We may meet again, sooner than you think.
Where?
Let's let that be a surprise.
Farewell, Pépel.
Good-bye, Baron.
The bronze, and you have the cigarette case already?
Sign here, please.
Where? There.
Give that back, you dirty thief!
You're the thief, charging so much for this rubbish.
Look.
Here you go, little man.
And if someday someone tells you Pépel's a thief, you'll set them straight.
Who starts?
Here's my spade.
You didn't have a spade before!
I can't play with a cheater!
Get out of here!
He's not here.
Who?
Who do you think?
Mind your own business.
I came to check on things. The floor hasn't been swept.
It's the actor's turn.
I don't care. If the police come to inspect, I'll be fined.
And if that happens, I'll throw you all out.
What will you live on?
Lodgers are easy to come by.
Why don't you sweep instead of reading all the time?
Have you seen my sister?
No, I haven't.
Doomed Love.
Give it back!
Stop squabbling and sweep the floor.
Look how filthy it is. A real pigsty.
Give me my book!
You're nuts with your book.
You believe all that nonsense?
This isn't nonsense!
You're all too stupid to understand!
Let her read. If she believes it, it's true.
Stupid novel.
A pack of lies.
Have pity.
See?
She's crying.
She enjoys it. Leave her alone.
Go ahead. It's your turn.
No. I can't breathe in all that dust.
It's harmful to my health.
Your organism is poisoned by alcohol."
So the doctor told me yesterday.
Your organism is poisoned by alcohol."
Your organo!
Not organo.
Organism.
Your organism is... -"
Sicambrian!
Sicambrian.
I'm very serious. My organism is poisoned.
I can't breathe dust.
Microbiatic!
What?
It's a very learned word.
I know tons of others like it.
I read a lot when I was a telegraphist.
And in Hamlet... -
In Hamlet the poet says... -
Words, words and more words.
There's a great play. I played the gravedigger.
You'd better start playing the sweeper.
You make so much noise. You bang and bang.
It's killing my ears.
Has my wife been in?
I don't know.
You're a nuisance.
You've got your spot, your bed, your workbench, yourself... - and all that for two rubles a month.
I'll have to charge you half a ruble extra.
Charge me extra for a rope and strangle me.
Why should I?
What good would that do me?
On the contrary, may God keep you.
Live as you like, and with that half ruble you give me
I'll light a candle to the Holy Virgin.
It will atone for my sins... and yours as well.
Don't you worry about your sins? You're a wicked man.
No one likes you or respects you. You're a nuisance.
Let me work.
You're not like the actor.
At least he's a good man.
He doesn't make noise. He's an educated man.
Kostylyov, I don't have any money.
Will you give me credit? As a reward for my goodness.
Goodness is not rewarded with gold, my friend.
Goodness is the most precious of treasures.
That has nothing to do with what you owe me.
You owe me your goodness free of charge, poor fool.
Wretched old crook!
What a lout.
If you don't pay me tomorrow, you're out on the street!
There are lots of others to take your place.
Give me the broom.
You can get back to your dreams, and I don't mind sweeping.
My organism... is poisoned by alcohol.
I understand you, my children.
You are poor lost lambs.
Black sheep!
Good-for-nothings!
Day after day
Night after night
Always the same hopelessness
Always waiting
Hurry up, Natasha, you lazy girl!
There's work upstairs.
Why aren't you in school?
Resting, Pépel?
Yes, I am.
Lucky you, with nothing to do.
What business is it of yours? Beat it.
Watch how you speak to me!
You forget I'm the boss around here.
You owe me respect.
Why take that tone with your fellow man?
Have you got my money?
What money?
For the watch.
What watch, my son?
Don't play games with me.
Yesterday, you promised me 10 rubles for a watch.
You gave me three. You owe me seven.
Hand it over!
Stop blinking like an old owl.
Don't get mad! That watch was... -
Stolen.
You knew that yesterday.
I don't buy stolen goods.
No kidding, holy man.
Hurry up and give me my money.
All in good time, Pépel.
What crude people!
Well, well.
So it's all gone?
Your house, clothes, cognac?
Gone, even the memory.
So you'll stay here?
Yes.
It isn't so bad.
You'd leave if it was.
That's another story.
Come on, I'll find you a bed.
Good old baron.
Here's a new lodger.
Who is he?
Just passing through.
For the night or longer?
We'll see.
You have any papers?
Lots, but they're all worthless.
You have any money?
I'll vouch for him. He's a friend. Come on.
King.
You always get that one.
It's an old habit. I can't help it.
Queen.
I've got another, nice and fresh.
This one is free. The owner's in jail.
Must have wanted a fresh bed.
Don't worry, I'll get you a mattress. Nothing to fret over.
Don't you want to know why I'm here?
No one asks questions around here. You're one of us now.
It doesn't matter anyway.
What do you call yourself now?
Afraid "Baron" would sound ridiculous here?
Not at all.
Are you a real baron?
As real as can be.
We had a count here once. A good guy, but he put on airs.
Nobility is like the pox... - you never get rid of it entirely.
If you're a baron, stay one. We're all free men here.
See, he knows everything.
What are they playing?
Manille. Know how to play?
I know them all.
Go ahead.
Your turn.
Diamonds.
Baron, I'll leave you with these gentlemen.
Have fun. See you later.
Is there room for one more?
Got money to lose?
Fifty kopecks.
Sit right down.
Give him your seat.
Whose deal is it?
Yours.
Mine?
Perfect.
If I only had five kopecks.
What for?
To drink.
Don't drink. It's bad for you.
Take this and let us play in peace.
Thanks.
Go on, deal.
Grandfather.
What is it, my child?
Tell me something. Talk to me.
I'm afraid.
I've always been afraid. I've been beaten so much.
I've always been hungry, yet I've always been afraid of taking more than my share.
Does one suffer there as here?
You'll want for nothing. You won't be afraid.
Death brings peace.
Death is kind to us poor.
You are so good.
You won't suffer anymore. It will all disappear.
I tell you, Anna, death is like a mother to us.
Where'd you hear that?
I didn't hear it.
It's my own idea. Faith in something makes it real!
Maybe it does, maybe it doesn't.
What difference does it make anyway?
Thank you, Inspector.
God will reward your kindness to a poor old man.
Next Sunday I'll light a candle for your soul.
Your sister-in-law is a hard worker.
Pretty, as well. I know whereof I speak.
You think?
We worry about her.
That's normal, at her age.
At her age,
I was a real live wire, completely wild.
A real prankster!
Even now I enjoy a good laugh.
But all in good taste, of course.
When one has my position, dignity must be upheld.
Miss, a pleasure.
Madame, I'll visit again very soon.
I really like this house.
Good-bye, Inspector.
My respects, Inspector.
Don't bother to show me out.
I know the way.
As you wish, Inspector.
Why are you just standing around?
Go finish your curtain.
Listen, did you see how the inspector looked at Natasha?
What do you think?
I don't understand.
You never do.
You need that man.
The just man is always vulnerable.
It's a cruel world.
And with Pépel's carelessness... -
What?
Not to mention all the others.
And all the merchandise I've got in stock.
Stolen merchandise.
Not all of it.
You knew the risks in being a fence.
A fence did you say?
Bitch! Tramp!
I picked you out of the gutter.
Come in.
What is it?
Anna just died.
Well, now. What a life!
I must go to the police station and make a statement.
The police will come.
Go downstairs. Anna died.
Lay her out as best as you can.
Hurry up, lazybones!
Imagine her coming here to die.
Wasn't there anywhere else?
Pépel, aren't you... -
God have mercy on her soul.
Running off?
I'm going for a walk. I've had enough of all this.
Had enough of me, too?
You, too.
I'm not the clinging type.
You can't force love, can you?
Thanks for the truth.
What truth?
It's over between us.
You look at me like you didn't know me.
But I do.
You're a pretty woman, Vassilissa.
You've got what it takes... but my heart never beat for you.
It wasn't always like that.
Even then, it wasn't love.
Any regrets?
Yes, in a way.
You're heartless.
Do you regret everything?
Not everything.
But pleasure isn't enough in itself.
What I really wanted was someone to tame me, gently, tenderly, like you would a wild animal.
Someone who'd try to make me into another man.
There's someone else.
It's obvious. I won't be humiliated.
When I get ahold of your sweetheart, she'll pay for it.
This is a slap in the face, Pépel, and I won't take it sitting down.
Don't be mad. Let's make it a clean break.
You ever think maybe I wanted something else, too?
Think you're the only one who wants to escape this mess?
I can't stand it. I'm suffocating here.
I was counting on you to get me out of here.
You were my only hope.
Get rid of my husband for me.
He's old and evil. It would be a good deed.
That's a nice combination:
a husband in the ground and a lover in the joint.
Why in the joint? Kostylyov could have an accident.
He's always exploited you. Remember last year?
You went to jail because of him!
You disgust me.
You refuse to help me?
Watch out, Pépel. It's dangerous to cross me!
You're all bark and no bite.
Not one word of pity.
From anyone!
Don't be shocked.
How can we pity the dead when we have no pity for the living?
We don't even pity ourselves.
Come on. This is no place for you.
I don't like the dead.
Why should you? Love the living.
What incredible luck!
Magnificent round.
But the one time I finally win, it's for a pittance a point.
Buying the drinks?
Of course.
Keep it down.
It doesn't matter.
Neither words nor noise can bother the dead.
Anyway, she's better off dead.
Lord, why did she even live?
We're born, we live, we die.
It's nothing to cry over.
I'll die in a flophouse too, someday.
Nonsense.
Your life is just beginning. It might be different.
Why kid myself?
No, try to understand.
No man ever loved Anna.
Perhaps a bit of love would've changed everything.
What man is there here to love me?
Drunks and thieves?
Drunks aren't always drunk, nor thieves always in prison.
Everyone gets a break sometime.
Listen, Natasha.
You ought to come away with me.
Why?
You have to love a man to do that.
There are days when I hate you with all my heart!
I think real love should be blind to faults, and I see yours clear as day.
What's the difference if you beat me or my sister does?
I'd sooner break my own arm than harm you.
No, Pépel.
The man I'll love won't be from here.
He'll have a job and he'll work.
He'll walk down the street without worrying about the police.
It's Pépel.
And I never suspected.
I see.
You want the same breed, just younger.
Get out, you little hypocrite!
Calm down!
This is my man!
His clothes are mine!
I'll have you beaten and thrown out!
Little slut!
Will you calm down?
Go ahead, hit me. Insult me.
Go upstairs.
You're acting like a fool! And over nothing.
You'll never have her, Pépel. Not her.
I just want peace.
Keep it up and you'll get your peace the same way Anna did.
Every night he came to the garden.
I trembled with fear and sadness.
He was pale, too, clutching his revolver.
Such hotheads, these students!
My tender love," he murmured.
My tender love!
Don't stop her from lying.
Go on, Nastia.
He called me his "boundless love."
My parents oppose this marriage and threaten to disown me, so I've decided to end it all."
He raised his pistol, loaded with 10 bullets.
Farewell," he said. "I can't live without you."
I answered, "My unforgettable Villiam... -"
William.
It was Gaston the other day.
Stop teasing the poor girl. Show some respect.
It's not what she says that matters, but why she says it.
Go on.
We're listening.
They're just jealous because they have nothing to tell.
No, I'll say no more.
I said to him, "Light of my life, nor can I live without you on this earth.
I'll love you as long as I live, but don't sacrifice your young life for me.
Go, leave me.
I'll spend all my days weeping for you.
Don't cry.
What an idiot!
And it's all from Doomed Love.
Shut up! You're so low, nothing moves you.
I believe you, dear. You had a great love.
You're telling the truth.
He was a student, you know. His name was Gaston.
He had a black goatee and patent-leather shoes.
God strike me dead if I'm lying!
He loved me like I loved him!
Patent-leather shoes, of course. A real student.
A search?
Lord, spare me such a trial!
But what am I accused of?
Am I not a good citizen?
I pay my taxes, though God knows they're high.
I respect the authorities.
Kostylyov, this is not my doing.
I just came to give you a friendly warning.
Someone high up has their eye on you.
I can't risk my position.
Can't we work something out?
If it's a question of money, in spite of my poverty, I could make a sacrifice.
It's a touchy situation.
You're in a bind, and I don't want to be dragged into it.
It's so hot today!
May I offer you some tea?
Please don't bother.
I insist. I'll call Natasha.
She makes wonderful tea.
Excellent idea.
But is your sister really here?
I thought she was out.
Oh, no. She just... -
We'll have someone call her.
A little woman like her is just what I need.
A sweet and lively housewife.
It's simple, Inspector. She does everything here.
A hard worker, inexpensive, easy to feed.
She's full of virtues.
All that and a pretty face, too. That never hurts.
The truth is, she's healthy and well-built.
With all the work in this house,
I don't know what we'd do without her.
But for you, no sacrifice is too great.
Yes, but would she have me?
Don't worry. I'll see to it.
I meant, she'd be most flattered by your attention.
Lord, first you send down these troubles upon me, and now you take Natasha away.
About those troubles... perhaps we can work something out.
Listen, leave the washing. Go make some tea.
It isn't time yet.
We have a guest.
Who?
The inspector.
I'm not going.
Why not?
I don't like him. He's fat and sweaty.
Men who sweat like that are disgusting.
I don't want to see him.
How dare you speak to me that way?
Don't you realize we need that man?
If he wanted, he could arrest us tomorrow, or take away Kostylyov's housing license.
In any case, he could ruin us.
You're nothing but an ungrateful wretch.
What does he want, anyway?
To see you for a moment.
That's not much. And it'll get us out of this mess.
Have you no heart?
Don't forget that we've fed you, sheltered you, saved you from the gutter.
Enough. I'll go.
They look after people like me?
Where?
In... -
I've forgotten the name of the town, but I'll remember.
There's a magnificent hospital with marble floors and columns.
It's bright and airy. You breathe freely.
A palace.
Marble.
Doctors in white coats look after you with great kindness.
Until then, get ready to be healed. Stop drinking, okay?
You'll start a new life.
A little tea in a family setting now and then is just the thing.
It makes me forget my administrative headaches.
Oh, yes.
Miss?
May I ask a favor?
We could go out on Sunday.
We could go to dinner anywhere you please.
Would you like that?
Certainly she would.
My sister never gets out.
The poor child.
What an honor for her. Isn't it, Natasha?
Don't cry.
I don't want to hurt you. Just the opposite.
The idiot!
She'll ruin everything.
My dream is to protect you.
Why refuse before you hear me out?
You'd live like a queen.
Believe me. Accept before it's too late.
Old Kostylyov can't be easy to live with.
And the others in the courtyard.
Look at them. Wallowing like pigs.
Is that any life for you?
I say it isn't.
And that's all I have to say.
I dreamed I was fishing and caught a huge bream.
It must've weighed five pounds.
A real dream fish. And then... -
And then your line broke, and you woke up.
And the bream was Vassilissa.
No, she makes me sick.
Everything here makes me sick.
Everything you touch is filthy.
The mattress, the pots... - everything's rotten.
The feelings, even the words you say... - covered in lice, cockroaches and slime.
Fishing for bream didn't work out so well.
Next time, dream about a different fish.
And Nastia with her Gaston, and the actor with his organism.
I'm tired of listening to them.
I need a change. I'm sick and tired of them.
Are you tired of me?
Of course not, you're different. You don't lie.
You don't go on about why you're here.
That'd be hard to do. I don't know how I got here.
There's a kind of fog in my noggin.
When I look back, it seems all I did was change uniforms.
First the schoolboy, then the student.
I've forgotten everything I ever learned at the university.
I got married, wore a tailcoat, then a dressing gown.
What was the point?
I wore the uniform of a government official and grew poorer.
My clothes became more and more threadbare.
Finally I wear these, the last of the line.
And it all seems like a dream.
Isn't it absurd?
Ever been to prison?
That would have been one more uniform.
And you?
No, not yet.
But it'll happen sooner or later.
My path was laid out for me by my father.
Poor guy spent his life in prison and urged me to follow in his footsteps, so... -
His concern for you does him credit.
Is he dead?
Yes.
He died in prison, just as I will.
The only thing that could change my father's prediction is if Natasha ran away with me.
Really? - Yeah.
If she'd just throw her arms around me and say,
Pépel, I believe in you. You'll protect me."
No more Pépel the thief. I'd be a new man.
We'd go far away, far from all this filth and rottenness!
What about you, Baron?
I'll stay here.
Once you told me how nice it was to doze in the grass.
I didn't really believe you then, but I do now.
Pepper?
I don't care.
Mustard?
I don't care.
She doesn't care.
I'll serve you myself.
Salad?
I want to save you from that brute Kostylyov.
Don't be a hypocrite. You know my sister made me come.
So what?
Isn't it nice here?
We can come every Sunday. Every day of the week.
Believe me when I say I want to treat you like a little queen.
You're no king.
No king! She's so witty!
Tell your king you're not angry.
Have mercy.
Make me drink until I forget everything.
Get me stewed to the gills, otherwise I'll never agree to be your queen.
For that you must agree to drink something!
Come, my little treasure.
Leave it to me.
In one hour, you won't even remember your mother's name.
What are you doing here?
Am I bothering you?
I came here to get away from you.
Looking for my sister, no doubt.
Why are you avoiding me?
I told you. It's over between us.
You're driving me crazy, always after me.
I'm sick of your stories, sick of your face! Get it?
What's wrong with me?
You're selfish.
You'd do anything to get what you want.
And her, with her great big eyes and clumsy hands, what can she give you?
That's my business.
What if she's making a fool of you?
What if the sweet rose, the holy saint, was like everyone else:
selling to the highest bidder?
I don't believe it.
Poor fool.
Know where she is?
It's the story of the paté made of lark:
half lark and half horse.
One lark.
You're not following.
One lark, and one horse.
One horse.
One lark.
Where'd my cigar go?
Tell me the one about the fat shopkeeper.
Where's my cigar?
It's too much!
Where is he?
I asked where he was.
What do you want?
How dare you come in here!
Oh, it's you. This won't take long.
Get out or I'll call the police.
Natasha, we need to talk, but this place disgusts me.
What right do you have to order me around? I'm not Vassilissa.
Let me go!
Exactly! What right?
Don't touch her, you thief! Vagabond! Hoodlum!
Pimp! Go back to Vassilissa!
Shut up.
Vassilissa's money isn't enough. You want her sister too!
Let go. You're hurting me.
You're hurting me, too, you know. Come on.
Help! Murderer!
Hoodlum! Pimp!
He's killing me!
Police!
Murderer!
What is this?
Get the police.
I didn't do anything.
To hell with your champagne!
A bit of ice, Inspector.
It'll do you good.
Settle down.
Let me do it. It's nice and cold.
The fresh air is helping already.
Little fool.
Sure you're not nuts?
I think you twisted my arm.
That's not all. I'd twist your neck to stop you.
I don't have a choice.
What else can I do with my life?
Unless I follow Anna into the hereafter.
No, you're not going to follow Anna.
Then who?
Me.
Where? To prison?
Natasha, try to understand me.
It's true... - I'm a thief.
No one ever taught me anything else.
My father was the same, and even before I could walk, people called me a thief.
Maybe if they hadn't, things would've been different.
Tell me, Natasha.
Won't you try to understand me?
Believe me.
Suppose I did?
If you believed me, I swear I'd give it all up, stealing and all this filth.
We'd go away together, anywhere. Far away.
I'd work. I can read and write. I'm a good locksmith.
I'm strong, and with you in my arms, I'd be even stronger. I'd move mountains!
Just say you trust me.
Silly Pépel.
Why?
Are you blind?
What do you mean?
Don't you understand?
Tell me.
Let me go!
I love you, Pépel. I'll follow you anywhere.
Wicked girl!
Don't you realize you're sinning against God?
Don't bother taking that off.
Go to your fiancé, right now, and beg forgiveness.
I won't!
You have no idea how angry I am!
Go apologize!
I won't!
Obey him!
I won't! Let go!
You won't go?
You scum!
That's Natasha screaming!
Filth!
Get upstairs quick. Natasha needs you.
Did they hurt you?
Get off me!
Careful, Pépel! This is a family matter!
Have you no shame?
If you touch her, you'll answer to me!
Let me at that bastard!
Let me go!
Let me at him!
A pretty pickle.
This looks bad.
Here come the police.
Kostylyov's been murdered. Pépel killed him.
Yes, Pépel did it.
I saw it with my own eyes.
It was Pépel.
He's upstairs. What are you waiting for?
It wasn't a murder. It was a brawl.
We're all just as guilty as Pépel.
He was an old bastard. His lack of kindness was what killed him.
I got a few licks in, too! He was about done for.
I kicked him... -
We don't know who hit him.
I hit him, too!
The lower depths killed him, not just Pépel.
Quiet, old fool.
It's the truth.
Where is he?
Upstairs with my sister.
It's carnival today
All the world is celebrating
Wearing unique costumes
Everyone is masquerading
I'm leaving. You hear me?
I'm leaving.
All my life I've wanted to escape from here.
I'm finally leaving.
Hey, silly goose.
What are you sniveling about?
What will you do?
I'll wait for him.
He'll leave, you'll see.
Who's "he"?
Who's he?
Him.
Me.
You're so modest, he of the confused genius.
Where will you go?
To look for a town, a hospital.
A big, bright, clean hospital, all marble and no dust.
I'll get better there. I'll be myself again.
I'll be on the path to rebirth, as King Lear said.
I'll regain my name, my stage name.
No one knows it here.
You don't know what it's like to lose your name.
My name.
Even a dog has a name, but not me!
That Louka was a dangerous charlatan.
He's turned your head with his lies, poor actor.
You're the liar, charlatan.
Shut up, milady. Louka was senile.
Baron, tell the truth: Was Louka lying?
He lied all day long.
Was he lying about the place where drunkards can be cured?
He meant if you keep drinking, you'll end up in the madhouse.
The madhouse?
The madhouse.
Don't listen. If Louka said so, it must be possible.
The madhouse?
You're a real baron.
Even in rags you're a menace.
Little louse.
Can't you play something more cheerful?
Sit, Jessica.
Look how the floor of heaven is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold.
There's not the smallest orb which thou behold'st but in his motion like an angel sings, still quiring to the young-eyed cherubims.
Such harmony is in immortal souls.
But whilst this muddy vesture of decay doth grossly close it in, we cannot hear it."
Harmony.
Come. It won't take long.
To die, to sleep, no more.
And by a sleep to say we end the heartache and the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to.
To die, to sleep, no more.
And by a sleep to say we end the heartache and the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to."
Listen to the actor.
He's got talent.
Well, Baron, I have nothing to give you as a souvenir.
So let's divide up the stables.
Take one.
You have any money?
I've got 40 rubles. That's enough.
Good-bye. Good-bye, Nastia.
You're a true friend.
Forty rubles.
Forty rubles. For two people.
That's what I said: 40 rubles.
Sentinel, keep close watch
I could never lie to you
I would prefer my freedom
Come quick!
It's serious.
The actor's hung himself.
Tonight the singing's come to an end.
Come on.
Let's get moving.
Step right up to the platform, ladies and gentlemen.
You will see the greatest show on the midway for only 50 cents.
These little ladies are entertaining you now, but in just a moment Little Egypt will turn on her stuff.
She has danced before all the crown heads of Europe.
Ladies and gentlemen, step right up and buy your tickets for Sandow, the strongest man in the world.
He juggles pianos. He plays marbles with cannonballs.
He lifts 10 times his own weight with one arm.
He can even raise his own salary.
Now, folks, step right this way.
You are looking at the sensation of the fair, the eighth Wonder of the World.
Ladies and gentlemen, this way. This way.
This little lady has wiggled herself from the desert to the shores of Lake Michigan.
And she's about to give you an exhibition absolutely free.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is not the dance that Little Egypt does inside but to prove our generosity, we're going to give a demonstration of that famous dance, the hootchy-kootch.
Egypt, wiggle.
That's sufficient.
Now, ladies and gentlemen-- He's a masterpiece of manhood.
Step up to the box office and buy your tickets.
The show's about to begin.
phenomenon. Ladies and gentlemen, this--
Well, how's business, Ziggy?
And now, ladies and gentlemen, Sandow concludes this performance by lifting, with Herculean strength, the largest dumbbell in the world.
An unusual feat, ladies and gentlemen for inside this huge dumbbell, there are other dumbbells.
Ladies and gentlemen, look.
There you are. Aren't they beautiful?
Aren't they glorious?
A total weight of 750 pounds.
Isn't it wonderful? Isn't it marvelous?
Let's give him a big hand.
What made you bring me to a show of this kind?
Well, you wouldn't let me see Little Egypt.
I'll bet a heifer against a mare the weights ain't on the level.
Seven hundred and fifty pounds, my foot.
I wonder what her total weight is.
Oh, Bill?
Yes, sir.
Open the curtains, will you?
Open up those curtains.
Hey, Bill, you know, it seems to me that this platform--
Oh, hello, baby. Want some candy, Jane, huh?
Bill, we ought to have this platform built higher.
There ought to be more steps.
The people in the back row can hardly see.
But, Mr. Ziegfeld, there's never anybody in the back rows.
Well, nevertheless, I want this higher.
There ought to be a lot more steps.
Okay, Mr. Ziegfeld.
I'm sorry I lost my temper, Florenz but I am awful disappointed.
I hope you never get downright disgusted.
What is wrong?
Why don't they come in?
You're the attraction, and you're asking me?
Maybe you would like to cancel my contract.
Oh, no, Sandow.
When I make a deal, it's a deal.
I like that. I like you.
Well, I like you too.
If you want to pay me some of my back salary, I take you to dinner, yeah?
Well, I'm not very hungry.
You're not worrying about your money, are you?
You don't think I'd ever walk out on you?
No, no.
Nobody do that to Sandow.
Maybe I better take you to dinner.
That's fine.
Hands up, mister, and give me all your money.
Well, I can't give you anything with my hands up, sweetheart.
All right, fresh, 23 skidoo for you. I'll help myself.
Oh, no. Oh, I see you got my little surprise.
This morning. Gee, ain't it swell?
Were you really surprised?
Well, wouldn't you be? -Yes.
If you expected a diamond ring.
Oh, don't be-- Tell you what we'll do.
We'll go to the Little Vienna Restaurant.
Oh, I'd like that.
Telegram, Mr. Billings.
Oh, thank you. Just wait a minute. There might be an answer.
Bad news?
No, it's from Ziegfeld. He's across the midway.
He can touch me, but he has to send wires.
Listen, "ln Little Egypt, you have the best female attraction of the fair.
In Sandow, I have the greatest male attraction.
Why not fake a romance?
The people will eat it up.
Then we can show them together, and I'd be willing to split 50-50."
Well, that sounds like a great idea.
Oh, yes, great.
I'm selling out every performance, he's going to be thrown out and he's willing to split 50-50.
Give me your pencil. I'll answer this one.
Jack? -Yes. -Is Ziegfeld a good friend of yours?
Oh, yes, we've been pals for years.
But you wouldn't like him. -No?
No, he's up one day and broke the next.
If he got $ 1 0,000 tomorrow he'd spend it on the girl he liked tomorrow night.
Wouldn't want to waste your time meeting a fellow like that.
Not if I met him on the right night.
On the right--?
Oh, don't you--
Shut up!
And just send that collect. -Yes, sir, and I'll deliver it too, sir.
Because every time I take Mr. Ziegfeld a message, he gives me 50 cents.
Oh, he does, does he?
Sure.
Yes, well, that's probably why he's always broke. Come on, dear.
This cheese is so strong it could walk over and say hello to your coffee.
Well, it had better not. This coffee's too weak to answer it.
Florenz, you're wonderful.
You make jokes even when you're so worried you can't touch your cold cuts.
I got no appetite neither.
They told me I'd find you here.
From Billings.
So soon he answers?
He must be crazy about your proposition.
Yeah.
Read it to me, Flo. Read it.
Dear Ziggy, your proposition interests me." What did I tell you?
But why fake a romance between Sandow and Little Egypt?
Let's make Sandow marry Little Egypt, and I'll split the children with you 50-50."
That message was collect. -Fifty cents.
Have you change for a dollar?
Sure, but you always....
Keep it.
Gee, thanks.
Florenz, I love you.
I will break chains for you I will lift buildings for you, but I will not have children for you.
But if I have children, I will not split them.
Oh, hello, Ziggy, I got your wire.
I just got yours too.
Patterson tells me he's putting you out Saturday.
He tells me too.
How do you do, Mr. Ziegfeld?
How do you--?
How do you do, Miss...?
Yes, Blair, this is Mr. Ziegfeld.
I'm very happy to know you, Miss Blair.
I'm so happy to meet you, Mr. Ziegfeld.
And this is Mr. Sandow, the strongest man in the--
The strongest man in the world.
Jack tells me the loveliest things about you.
Oh, yes, I imagine.
I could tell you lovely things about you.
He's only just met you and he's going to tell you all about yourself.
Won't you sit down?
Thank you.
Oh, but no, we've got-
I've seen you many times on the midway. - There's a table--
Fibber.
I bet you never even noticed me. -Yes, I have.
Yesterday, you were wearing a red dress trimmed in black lace.
Yes.
And a yellow hat, and it was atrocious.
Each was all right in itself, mind you but the combination....
And last Sunday, you were wearing a blue gown and an orchid hat.
Well, yes.
And you were wrong again.
Well, aren't we the observer?
Do you always check the right combinations for women?
Always for beautiful women.
Oh, well, that's nice. Thank you.
How do I look today?
Well, I don't like your hat. -It shades your eyes, and I like your eyes.
Thank you.
He ought to be packing his own clothes instead of selecting yours.
Come on, Ruth, we've got to go. -Yes. Well, goodbye, then.
I'll be seeing you around the grounds.
Yes. Well, not after Saturday, you won't.
That fella Billings makes me mad. -Yes?
Even that music from his Little Egypt drives me crazy.
You won't have to listen to it much longer.
Wait a minute.
For five weeks you've been touching that elephant for luck and now in five days, we get put out.
I know it's superstition, but an old Hindu told me that if you touch an elephant's trunk, and he raises it, everything will be all right.
We know we got hard luck without that elephant should tell us.
Say, I know what's wrong. You should touch him.
You're the attraction. -Me?
Sure. Go on, go ahead.
It sounds silly, but all right, I'll do it.
Look, Florenz, would he do that for me? The Great Sandow.
Sandow.
So that's what you call good luck, yeah?
Look, Sandow, you've got to expect a little rain with the sunshine.
That was very embarrassing, Florenz, very embarrassing.
Don't get your dander up.
Who knows?
Maybe that little shower will bring us oodles of luck.
Well, I hope it brings us so much business like that Little Egypt.
Look at those peoples, how they crowd in to see that woman make wiggles when yet they wouldn't come to see me lift weights no other man in the world can.
Sandow, I'm afraid your trouble is you developed the wrong muscles.
What you say?
Every muscle in Sandow's body is developed even the toes, like that.
With one arm I make a better dance than that Little Egypt with the whole body.
Look, boss.
Are you Mr. Sandow, the strongman?
Yes, madam, this is the Great Sandow.
Oh, look at those huge shoulders. Aren't they marvelous?
Yes, dear, come on.
And that big chest.
I never saw a chest like that before.
Oh, come on.
And his waistline, oh, it's simply magnificent.
Precious, come on. -Just a minute, dear.
Mr. Sandow, I think your muscles are simply astounding.
Perhaps madam would like to feel the muscles of Sandow.
Oh, I'd love to.
Sandow, your arm.
Florenz, is she dead?
No, she's only fainted. -But, oh, what an idea. Come on!
What's wrong? -Where are you going?
The papers.
To the newspapers.
I'll fill them so full, women will fight to see you.
Not to watch you lift weights, but simply to feel your muscles.
Why, you've got more sex appeal in your one arm than Little Egypt has in her whole--
Sandow, the modern Hercules.
The miracle of strength.
Watch his muscles quiver in musical rhythm.
Sandow, quiver.
Sufficient.
And now, ladies, if you want to see more of the Great Sandow if your hearts are strong enough to stand the thrill step up and buy your ticket.
The show starts in five minutes. -Folks, this is the show--
How's business, Jack?
All right?
Doesn't it sparkle?
Yes, doesn't it?
You like it?
I certainly do.
I'm glad.
Dr. Ziegfeld.
Yeah?
Can't I play my piece for you now?
I get awful tired of this....
I don't blame you, Mary Lou. So do I.
Go ahead, then. Go on, play your little piece now.
Dr. Ziegfeld?
Yes, dear.
Do you know I was mad at your son?
What?
Mad at your best fella?
Oh, but why?
Because he left us for that old World's Fair.
Oh, well, darling, you know the fair closed yesterday.
And is he coming back here again?
Well, I hope so. Go on. You go on with your lesson.
Dr. Ziegfeld.
Yes, dear.
Did you know I was going to marry your son?
Well, well, this is so sudden. -Are you?
Oh, yes. We got that settled months ago.
Oh, yes, Father, didn't you know Mary Lou and I are engaged?
Well, don't I get a kiss today?
Not even a smile?
Well, Father, what do you think of that?
My future wife won't even kiss me...
...and I brought her a present too.
What?
Kiss first.
No, present first.
No, kiss first. I'll tell you what.
We'll both give at the same time.
How's that?
I'll count three.
Ready? One.
Two. -Same time, remember.
Three.
Thank you so much.
Dr. Ziegfeld, isn't it lovely?
Beautiful.
I'm going to open it right now.
Right now. Yes.
Oh, well, well, well.
Well, Florenz, what have you decided to do?
Well, I'm going to New York tomorrow, Dad.
With that Sandow, that strongman?
Father, I don't really belong here.
No, I don't like it.
You don't like it, huh?
The greatest music conservatory in the country. Students from all over the world are coming here and you-
I built it all myself.
You don't like it.
You realize that maybe somewhere in one of these rooms we find a future Beethoven or Liszt?
And you, my own son, all you want is a circus.
A circus with a fellow that can throw cannonballs.
Well, now, Dad, don't be upset.
Sandow is a means to an end.
Yeah, to your end.
When you was a little fellow, since then, I've educated you in music and art.
From your mother, you got the refinement, taste, culture. What good has it all done?
What has it done you?
What are you now anyhow?
A muscle manager.
A beef exhibitor.
Then you got to go on the outside, and you gotta be....
You gotta act like a dog outside. You act like a dog.
Wait a minute, what do you mean, a dog?
You know what I mean. I don't mean you're a dog, I mean you got--
You gotta go outside and be a barker.
That's a dog, ain't it?
Now let me tell you something.
If you go away from here I'll never speak to you again as long as I live.
Oh, Dad, you don't mean that.
Yes, I do mean it.
And I mean- - I mean every word of it.
Hey, wait a minute here.
Now, you just stop that crying.
Now, you tell your fellow why you're crying.
If you're my fellow, why are you going away?
Now look here, you sit right up here, and I'll tell you all about it.
Now, I'll be honest with you.
I'm not really your fellow.
You mean you don't like me anymore?
I not only like you, I love you.
But you know, I'm the funniest kind of a fellow.
I love all the girls.
How can you do that?
Do they let you?
Well, you didn't quite understand what I mean, darling.
Look.... Some people like beautiful paintings.
Like that one? -Like that one.
Some people love beautiful flowers.
Like those?
Like those.
Now, I love beautiful little girls like this one.
You know what I'm going to do someday?
What?
I'm going to take all the beautiful little girls like you and I'm going to put them together and make pictures with them.
Will I be in a picture?
Well, I should say you will.
But in the meantime, I think that we ought to break our engagement. -Why?
Well, because there are going to be lots of boys who want to take you out and buy you sodas.
If you're engaged to me, you can't go with them. -Why can't I?
Because if you're married to me I'm not going to have you running around with other boys.
I couldn't stand for that.
You couldn't?
Well, of course I couldn't.
Well, what are you laughing at?
At you, you're jealous.
Well, you can just bet I'm jealous.
Well, now I've got to run along.
Florenz.
Will you be home to dinner tonight?
Yes, Dad.
Well, I'll see you then.
And in the meantime, son, remember:
Anything you do, I wish you luck.
I knew you would.
Hold it, Mr. Ziegfeld.
Thank you. Greetings.
Greetings to San Francisco from my troupe, including the strongest man in the world, Sandow.
Humane Society?
Say, what's this I read in the papers about a lion and a bear?
Is your society going to tolerate such an atrocity?
Are you going to spill the blood of animals over the good name of San Francisco?
Well, I didn't think you'd permit such cruelty.
Why, it would be a crime to send a poor grizzly bear into a cage with a man-eating lion.
Crime.
What's so funny?
Oh, you wouldn't understand because you don't know Ziegfeld.
Police are after him and this paper's two weeks old, so he's probably in jail by now.
But do you know him, Jack?
Oh, yeah, he's a pal of mine.
Well, Jack, this is a surprise.
Yes.
Certainly glad to see you aboard.
Yes, well, I'm glad I--
Pardon me, I'll be back in a few minutes, darling.
I thought perhaps you were-- -Hey, who is she?
You'll never know.
What happened in Frisco?
Did you really send Sandow in against a lion?
Sure, but the lion wouldn't fight. Wouldn't or couldn't?
To tell you the truth, Jack, I didn't stay for the finish.
I sort of thought that.... -Yes, I know.
Well, where is Sandow now?
He's in New York.
He's going into the legitimate.
He's with Lillian Russell in As You Like It.
Yeah, well, I don't think I'd like it.
What are you going to Europe for, another strongman?
Oh, no, no.
Just a little vacation. -London?
Well, Monte Carlo first.
You're gonna lose all the money you made on Sandow, huh?
No, I'm going to double it. -Oh, yes.
What are you going for, another Little Egypt?
Oh, no, just a rest.
Of course, if I see any exceptional talent, I'll pick it up.
Well, naturally.
So will I.
Oh, you got anybody in mind? No, no.
Why, have you?
No, no.
Only the greatest artist in Europe, that's all.
Say, who's that?
If I told you, you'd cross me before we crossed the ocean.
Miss Carlisle wishes to know whether there will be three for tea or just two.
Just two. Yes, just two.
Miss Carlisle, huh?
Yes, sir. Oh, thank you.
You're.... -You're Mr. Billings' man, are you? -Yes, sir.
Well, you're very efficient.
What is your name?
Sidney, sir. Sidney.
How much does Mr. Billings pay you, Sidney?
One hundred a month, sir.
Only-
Well, that's not very much, is it?
I hadn't thought of it, sir.
Well, think of it, Sidney.
London Evening News.
Oh, take care of the luggage, will you? And tip the doorman, Sidney.
Yes, sir.
You have a reservation for Florenz Ziegfeld Jr.? -Yes, sir.
Will you register, please?
Is Mr. Billings still here?
Yes, sir, on your floor. -Oh, yes.
Boy. Rooms 325 and 26.
Thank you.
Well, you ingrate, you deserter-- Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.
Well, why didn't you tell me you were dissatisfied?
I-- -You pirate.
Now wait a minute, Jack.
Gentlemen don't quarrel over gentlemen's gentlemen. -Oh, you--
Let me tell you the whole story.
If you're still angry, Sidney can go back with you. -Oh, I--
Look, Jack, it was this way.
I've always envied you.
Your dress, your style, the way you look.
So that when I saw your valet, and I realized that it was he who took such magnificent care of you well, I just couldn't resist the temptation of hiring him for myself.
You mean, you wanted to look like me?
Well, that's right, Jack. I wanted to look just like you.
You faker. What are you doing here?
I thought you weren't going to be in London for weeks.
Well, that's a long story.
You know, I was going to break the bank at Monte Carlo.
But the bank broke you, huh? -What did you lose?
Fifty-thousand dollars.
What have you got left?
Fifty cents.
Well, I'll see you later.
But, Jack, wait a minute.
Lend me 5000, will you?
Well, would you--?
Would you make it 2500?
If I gave you $2500, by the time you tipped six bellboys, you'd be broke again.
Look, Jack, I really need it. I'll tell you what.
I'll give you $500 if you'll catch the next boat back to New York.
There's one leaving in the morning. Fair enough?
It's fair, but not enough.
Will you sail with me?
Oh, no, Mr. Ziegfeld, I have business in London.
Oh, haven't you got the world's greatest artist yet?
No, not yet, but I will have. Who is it, Jack?
Go on, you can tell me now.
I'm broke.
I won't tell you till I have her name on the dotted line.
It's a her, is it?
Yes, and a beautiful her too, and she's signing the contract tonight.
Goodbye, Mr. Ziegfeld.
Goodbye, Mr. Billings.
I say, doorman, did Mr. Billings come out?
Just this moment drove away.
I've got a very important message for him.
Do you know where he went? -Palace music hall.
Is it a good show?
Not so much, sir.
Except for the French actress. She's truly wonderful.
She has eyes this big, sir.
Every time she blinks them at you, you jolly well blink yourself, sir.
Have you seen Anna Held, sir?
No, no, I haven't, but I will tonight. Thank you, sir.
I say, sir, do you realize you gave me £5?
Yes, I'm trying to lose weight.
Isn't it magnificent?
For me, Marie?
From whom?
Whoever gathered all the orchids in the world just for me?
I do not know, but they must've cost thousands of francs. Was no card with it?
Oh, yes.
Marie, this is very strange. -What, madame?
I learned the English words, I sing the English songs, yet I cannot read English.
Please read it to me.
My dear Miss Held, it is very important to your future that you see me before signing any contracts.
I shall be waiting at the stage entrance immediately after your performance.
Florenz Ziegfeld Jr." -Who's this Florenz Ziegfeld Jr.?
I do not know, madame.
And why is it junior?
Is he a little boy?
I do not know, madame.
I will not see this Mr. Ziegfeld Jr.
You will see Monsieur Billings, oui?
Oh, Marie, these flowers are very nice.
I think I am polite and see this Monsieur Junior Ziegfeld.
But Billings is coming to talk to you about the great American tour. Has madame forgotten his cables?
Oh, yes, that's all right, but these flowers are very beautiful.
Well, Jack, she's all right. Yeah, I know she is without you telling me.
I wish you wouldn't keep following me.
All right.
Well, good night.
Good night.
I wish you wouldn't annoy me. Miss Held is expecting me.
I'm going to sign the contract tonight.
That's great. -You bet it is.
I said it was.
Yes, well, good night.
Good night.
Will you stop shadowing me? I'm not following you.
I just happen to be going your way.
You've got a date with a chorus girl, I suppose.
You're going to spend that $500. I can't spend it.
I've spent it. -Oh, you've spent-
Well, good night. -Good night.
I beg your pardon, sir, but--
I have an appointment with Miss Held.
Is Mr. Ziegfeld out here? -Oh, no--
Yes, my dear.
I'm Mr. Ziegfeld.
Mr. Ziegfeld, Miss Held would like you to come in, please. Would you mind that for me?
Well, good night, Jack.
Oh, Mr. Ziegfeld, your orchids.
They are the most beautiful orchids I have ever seen.
Won't you come in, Monsieur Ziegfeld?
Your flowers are so beautiful.
I could not resist the temptation to thank you.
Do you mind my telling you that you should never wear so many jewels on your hands?
Some women, yes.
But your hands, no.
Oh, that's a very nice compliment. Did you hear that, Marie?
Won't you sit down?
Thank you.
I did not know Americans could be so gallant.
Tell me, Monsieur Ziegfeld, are you in the theater? Yes, I'm a producer.
Did you hear that, Marie?
Monsieur Ziegfeld is an American producer.
Do you know Monsieur Billings?
Billings?
Billings.
He's American producer too.
Oh, is that so?
No, I've never heard of him.
No?
Of course, not in New York, that is. America's a big country.
We still have producers in the West putting on shows for the Indians.
Do you mean the savages? -Yes.
Did you hear that, Marie?
I do not think I will like America.
Oh, you'll love New York.
Would New York love me?
I think so.
You only think so?
Did you not like my performance?
Yes and no.
Yes and no.
Does it mean yes or no?
Well, both.
Did you not care for my singing, no? -Yes.
A trifle nasal, I thought, but yes. And you did not like my costumes either?
I thought one dress was very effective, but the rest, no.
Monsieur Ziegfeld, I think you are very rude.
Please go.
Marie, open the door.
Monsieur Ziegfeld.
Yes? Come back, please.
Sit down.
You know, you are very honest. I like you very much.
Your note says it is important to my future to see you.
If you want to play in New York, it is.
I have many offers for New York now.
I've no doubt, but so have many others.
There's foreign talent going into New York every day.
What?
Well, they open at Tony Pastor's theater, and they get the hook.
The hook, what is that?
Hook, a little thing you catch fish with.
You know, a hook.
Now, if I take you over, I'll present you on Broadway.
In a great show, in the best theater, to the best people. I'll exploit you from coast to coast.
Exploit?
What is that?
I'll put you over, I'll sell you.
Sell me?
To the public.
And I'll make them pay for you.
And how much will you pay me?
I'll advertise your name from every corner.
Women will be wearing Anna Held hats, shoes, corsets.
Even the children will know you.
But how much will you pay me?
More publicity than you've ever dreamed of.
Yes, that's all right.
But how much money will you give me?
I'll give you the greatest opening night that New York has ever had. You'll see the Goulds, the Astors, the Vanderbilts.
Diamond Jim" Brady, Lillian Russell.
Lillian Russell?
Yes.
Oh, I would so much like to see her.
Well. No.
First you must speak about the money because I have so many offers now.
I'll meet your biggest offer.
Really?
Well, that is very nice of you.
But maybe when you hear how much it is, you don't think I'm worth so much. How much is it?
They are all very good, but the highest one is that of Mr. Billings.
He says he will give me 50,000 francs besides my salary, which is very big just to sign the contract.
That is how much in American money? -$ 1 0,000, madame.
$ 1 0,000, monsieur.
Ten thousand dollars.
Oui, that's a very big amount.
And even if you would give me the $ 1 0,000 and I sign with you you still would have to wait till I finished my London engagement.
I couldn't do that. You couldn't even wait for me?
I couldn't even give you the $ 1 0,000.
You think it's too much, huh? -I think it isn't enough.
But I haven't it.
What, you expect I should sign a contract for America with you...
...and you don't even have $ 1 0,000? -I haven't even 1 000.
I did have before I stopped at Monte Carlo, but right now, I haven't even 1 00.
But I'll spread your name all over--
It is enough!
You're just trying to make the fool of me. You are the impostor.
You are no gentleman. Please go.
Marie, open the door.
Monsieur Ziegfeld.
Come back, please.
Sit down.
You know, you're very honest.
I like you very much.
Mr. Vanderbilt's carriage.
Mr. Van Rensselaer's carriage. -She has big eyes.
But I couldn't understand a word she said.
I'll take Lillian Russell.
Mr. Astor's carriage.
Did you like her?
Cute.
Did you notice the empty seats? Miss Russell's carriage.
I think she's charming.
Why, there's Lillian Russell.
Mr. Thaw's carriage.
Never mind, I don't want a carriage.
The show's all right if they had an American star.
Mrs. Harriman's carriage.
Mr. Stuyvesant's carriage.
You made a bad bet, Jim.
May I have your carriage called, Mr. Brady? -Yes.
Oh, Ziggy.
Stanford and I just made a little wager.
He bet me 5000 that I wouldn't get back the 1 0,000 you borrowed... -...to bring Anna over here.
Mr.
Brady's carriage.
I'll split your end 50-50 with you, Mr. White. I told you so.
I told you so.
Well, what's a few thousand dollars anyway?
Mr. Chandler's carriage.
Mr. Saks' carriage.
Balcony 22.
Well, Sampston, what's the loss this week?
The show earned a profit of $ 1 340.32.
You drew $2550 which gives us a loss of $ 1 209.68.
We can't keep the show running with losses.
Say, where's Sage?
Upstairs.
What a press agent, never around.
Take a wire to him.
But he's just upstairs in his office. -I know it.
Take a wire anyway. How can you do business without publicity?
Stop. Anna Held was the sensation of Europe.
Stop. Appeared before kings and queens.
Stop. Yet you get nothing in the papers.
Stop. You're ruining me.
Stop. If you're a press agent, I'm President Cleveland.
Stop.
Beg your pardon.
Pardon, madame.
It is not jolie.
It is jolly. Jolie, that's what I said, jolie.
Pardon, it's my mistake.
I mean jolly.
Jolly. Good.
Please, let's start again.
Jolly.
No, no, no. I won't sing today.
I can't sing today.
I'm much too much inside here.
Marie? Marie.
It's so silly for Anna Held to take singing lessons.
But Ziegfeld did not ask me to teach you.
I simply want to help madame to lose her French accent.
But your accent is much more than my accent, and I don't want to lose my accent.
Marie, did you try to get Monsieur Ziegfeld again?
He is not home, madame.
Please try it again.
And the reporters? -They are still in the lobby.
Tell them to go away.
Tell the hotel to push them out.
Tell them we are going back to France.
That's what we will do. We are going back to Paris.
I'm too happy, madame.
Happy about what?
We are sailing for Paris.
No?
No, I changed my mind.
Marie, go unpack my things.
You see, it's true.
It is not. -It is.
No.
What is true and what is not true?
Pierre says madame is in love with Monsieur Ziegfeld.
Did you say that, Pierre?
Why did you say that, Pierre?
Because I'm afraid it's true.
Why are you afraid?
Don't you like Monsieur Ziegfeld?
Oui, madame, that's the trouble.
Everybody likes him, especially the ladies.
Oh, madame, you'd never be happy with him. You'd never be able to hold him.
Why, he attracts women like the flowers attract bees.
Like the flypaper attract the flies.
Well, that's all right.
I've seen the flies on the flypaper and it seems to me they stick very well.
But, madame--
Pierre, please.
How can I love someone who puts terrible things in the newspaper has millions of reporters annoying me?
Pardon, madame, but the newspapers have been very nice to you.
Why don't you want to see the reporters?
Because I know exactly what they want to ask me.
You do not understand, no?
Frankly, no, madame.
Oh, then I will tell you what happened. Two months ago, Monsieur Ziegfeld says:
Anna, from now on, I'm going to send you, every day, a big present."
I say, "Thank you so much, Flo--"
I mean, "Mr. Ziegfeld.
But already you send me orchids every morning."
Those are from him.
But he says, "No, Anna, this is something much more important."
So naturally, I cannot wait to see what he sends me.
And the next day, what do you think I get? -A diamond ring?
No. -A bracelet?
No.
Four big cans of milk.
Milk. -Twenty gallons.
Twenty gallons of milk?
Twenty gallons of milk.
Shut up!
Twenty gallons of milk.
Oh, please.
No. I'm so sorry. Excuse me.
Well, that night I say to Flo-- I mean, Mr. Ziegfeld: "Flo, why do you send me so much milk?"
And he just laughs and says, "Anna, that's a great idea.
You get it from now on every day." "Every day, 20 gallons of milk?"
I say, "Flo, who can drink so much milk?" And do you know what he says?
Don't drink it, bathe in it.
And you will be a big success."
No!
Well, I'm too angry to speak. In Paris, I was a big success because they liked my voice.
In London, because they liked my singing.
But in America, to be a big success, I need 20 gallons of milk and must sit in it!
Well, do you bathe in it, madame?
No, of course not.
But every day, we get the milk and take it in because Monsieur Ziegfeld says we must carry out his idea.
And what happened?
Did you read this morning, the paper?
No, madame. -Please.
Ziegfeld is sued for Anna Held's milk bill."
On the front page.
Twenty gallons of milk.
Oh, I'm so ashamed.
Marie, please call him again.
If he's not there, leave the message.
Tell him I do not want one can more of milk from him.
And I don't want the orchids either.
Hello? -Oh, those reporters again.
Tell them no.
I do not want to speak to them.
Madame, it is Monsieur Ziegfeld.
I don't want to speak to him either.
I never wish to speak to him again.
Where is he?
Downstairs in the lobby, madame.
Tell him to come up.
But if he brings one of those reporters, don't let him in.
Let them on the floor.
I want him to see them there.
I make him pick them up. He embarrasses me, I embarrass him.
Madame, if you will take my advice, you will not appear so excited.
Yes, you are right, Pierre. Pierre, play. Play.
I sing for you, yes. Just like he's not here. We'll let him wait till I'm finished.
Come on, play, play, play.
Your missus is in lovely voice today, Marie.
Oui, monsieur. You will see.
Marie, someone has apparently spilled the orchids. Now, will you phone Sidney for me?
Have him send up another dozen immediately.
Why do you not pick these up?
Because fallen flowers, my dear, are like fallen stars. They soon lose their luster.
Marie, pick them up.
No, I cannot sing today. I'm much too angry to sing.
I'm sick of watching you roll your eyes like I do.
Please go home. I give you your notes. Please take them.
Go home, yes? Go.
So I'm a fallen star, yes? I have no luster, no?
Oh, yes, you have, my dear.
But do you know what it comes from?
I don't care. What? Milk baths.
Or at least that's what you must tell the reporters.
I'm so hurt.
The front page of the paper says you are sued on my account.
If you send milk, why don't you pay for it? If I did, it wouldn't be in the papers.
Can't you tell them I just used the milk without buying it and being sued for it?
Now it's a matter of record.
Besides, they don't care whether I ever pay the bill.
All that interests them is that in two months, you've used 1 200 gallons of milk.
This is terrible. -Ask the reporters to come up.
Do nothing of the kind.
Anna, you must not insult the press.
If they come up, I tell the truth.
No, at first, tell them nothing.
Desk, please.
Pretend embarrassment.
Pretend it?
I was never so ashamed.
Are the gentlemen of the press still waiting for Miss Held?
What are you doing?
Oh, yes, if you will, please.
I will say I never in my life took a milk bath.
I will tell them it is all a press story.
I will go back to France. Marie, pack the things.
Quick.
This time I mean it!
You cannot make a circus of me. I'm not a strongman like Sandow.
I'm a real artist, and I never, never, never will say that.
Yes?
Oh, ask them to come right up, please. No!
Anna, don't you realize that if we put this story over your name will be in headlines from coast to coast?
Every woman in the country will be talking about you.
I don't care.
I do not have to be a cow to be a success.
And before I make such a fool of myself, I tear up my contract with you.
And besides- - Besides--
And besides, you do nothing as I like to have it.
It must always be your way. I ask you 1 000 times to have costumes like Lillian Russell.
She has not to take milk baths to be a success.
She is beautiful.
But, no, I cannot have gowns like her. There now.
Tell the reporters about that!
I mean it.
I'm determined.
Anna. You let the reporters come up, yes?
All right, I tell them everything.
Anna?
Well, I should tell them, no?
No.
Now, you do what I ask you to, darling and I'll do whatever you wish.
You mean, you'll let me have gowns like Lillian Russell? Oh, no, darling.
You're not her type.
But I'll tell you what I will do. -What?
I'll put eight Lillian Russells on the stage behind you.
Isn't Anna beautiful?
I wonder if the milk baths really make her skin so nice.
Oh, they most certainly do.
I've been taking them for a long time.
Oh, Marie, were they not wonderful tonight? And the girls!
Don't they look gorgeous?
Marie. Look.
From my Flo.
Oh, my Flo.
Oh, Marie! Marie!
You read what he says. Oui, madame.
Read it to me, quick!
What does it say?
My darling.
I never knew that one long year could seem like one short moment.
You are magnificent, my wife. Flo."
Oh, Marie. -Marie, did you hear that?
I just read it, madame. No, no.
Did you hear what he says?
You are magnificent, my wife." Oh, madame, look!
Look!
Marie!
Oh, isn't it gorgeous? Oh, madame, look, look!
Here's another one!
Oh, Marie!
Oh, that makes me so much inside. Here.
Much too much.
First, he gives me all the flowers in the world and now he takes the stars from the heavens, just for me.
You're magnificent, my wife."
Am I magnificent, Marie? -Oui, madame. No, no, no.
He's magnificent, not I.
Marie, I must show them to the girls!
I come back immediately!
And when Mr. Ziegfeld comes, please tell him he shall wait!
Girls, would you like to see something wonderful?
Oh, what is it?
Look! And this! -Diamonds!
May I try the bracelet?
Yes, sure.
That's gorgeous.
Audrey, are you not interested in my presents?
I would be if they were mine.
But, Audrey, you will have many of them someday.
Maybe you have to work a little, to suffer a little. -But what is that?
I'll work, but I won't suffer.
Here you are, dear. -Thank you.
Isn't it beautiful, Audrey?
I'll say it is.
I'd give my soul for one like it.
That would be a very bad bargain, Audrey.
All right, that's fine! Tie it off!
You're better with your feet than your broom. Mr. Ziegfeld, you think so?
I wish you'd give me a chance.
I've got talent.
I'd like to get away from shifting scenery and moving props.
How long have you been a property boy?
Five years.
But my heart hasn't been in it. You've been working a long time without your heart.
And this weekly return tickles me more.
Look, a profit of $5000.
If you'll just be conservative, I mean, live reasonably.
Don't incur any fresh obligations, forget you have charge accounts...
...and you'll soon-- -You're right.
I will.
Darling!
Oh, Anna.
Anna.
You're the sweetest husband in the whole world.
Mr. Sampston! Look.
From my husband.
On our anniversary. This and this.
Are they not gorgeous diamonds? Yes, indeed, Miss Held, gorgeous.
Good night, Mr. Ziegfeld.
Good night, Sampston.
He didn't seem very happy about my presents, oui?
Anna, men who keep books are never very happy.
Marie, you go out for a while. He is my maid tonight.
Go, go, go, go.
Oh, I am, am I?
Yes, you are.
Later, I count the diamonds in the bracelet and necklace and kiss you for each one.
What about the orchids?
Don't I get anything for them?
For each petal of each orchid, another kiss extra.
Take off my stocking, please. You know, this might get to be a habit.
Flo, you're wonderful.
Do you know that? I suspect it.
Everything you promise me, you do.
Everything you say will happen, happens.
And now I am a big success in America, thanks to you.
Flo!
Why do you do that when I am trying to say nice things to you?
Besides, you're a very bad mate.
But I love you.
What?
Flo, are you as happy as I am?
Happier. Why do you ask? Because sometimes I think I am too happy.
Sometimes I get afraid it won't be always like this working only for you while you do the show just for me.
Couldn't I do another show without spoiling our happiness?
Of course you could.
Don't be silly.
Do you want to do another show?
Well, darling, now that you've made such a tremendous success I have a little idea that I'd like to carry out.
Idea for a show?
The biggest kind of a show.
With music and girls?
Beautiful girls and--
And without me, oui?
Well, darling, you couldn't do two shows at once, could you?
Now, Anna, see here. Suppose we go down to Rector's and celebrate our anniversary?
No, I don't-- -Just us and a bottle of wine.
I don't feel like it.
Come on, now, dear.
No, I'm so nervous.
It'll be good for you. I'm so tired.
I'm so disappointed in you I could scream!
I mean it.
I thought you loved me more than anything in the world.
I thought I am your one ideal, your only ambition.
Anna-- -No.
I think only of you, and I thought you will only think of me.
But it is not so.
You have big plans without me. You will do a big show.
You will go broke again! Anna, you're jealous.
No, Flo! -Yes.
Don't say that, no, no, no!
I hate jealous people, and I don't know what's....
I'm angry, and I wish you would go.
Please, please.
Please go. Go! Go!
Marie! Marie.
Good morning, Miss Drake. Messages?
Nothing important, except Mr. Erlanger wants to see you today.
Mr. Ziegfeld is in your office.
Well, why in my office instead of out here?
I thought he'd be more comfortable in there.
Well, I-
Oh yes, I see.
To what do I owe the honor of this visit, Mr. Ziegfeld?
Mr. Billings, if you've ever had it in for me, you've certainly avenged yourself.
This is positively the worst cigar I've ever smoked in my life.
How are you, Jack? -All right.
How are you? -Never better.
Sit, won't you?
Thank you. Nice of you.
I'm here to do you a great favor.
I'm sorry, I can't take advantage of it.
I'm broke. That's why I'm hooked up with Erlanger.
Oh, well, that's fine for me.
He's just the man I need. Jack, I want to do a new show, a big show.
I'm willing to split it 50-50 with Erlanger, and all he has to do is put up the money...
...and furnish the theaters.
Oh, that's all?
That's all.
Of course, you'd furnish the star. Oh, this isn't for Anna. Anna's show is all set.
No, in this one...
... I want to star the girls. -Don't be ridiculous.
Without personalities, you haven't got a chance.
I'll have personalities, all right, lots of them.
But they'll mostly be blonds and brunettes.
What are you going to call this opera?
I'm going to call it the Ziegfeld Follies.
Follies. Follies, all right.
What's the matter?
That's a good title.
What's so unusual about a girl show?
We've got plenty now.
I don't mean that kind.
They're way out-of-date.
You're using the same scenery you used 20 years ago, wood wings and flats.
I want to do a show with silk drapes, with lace, with beautiful girls.
I won't dress them for the men in the front but for the women in the back.
I want to surround them with glamour, glitter.
Glorify them.
There's a good word, Jack. "Glorify." Sounds all right if you know what it means.
It'll look all right too.
Glorifying the American Girl."
Where you gonna find these beautiful girls?
I'll take them from homes, from stores, from shops--
From offices.
I beg your pardon. Mr. Erlanger would like to see you now.
Oh, all right.
Yes, well, that'll do, Miss Drake.
Yes, sir. Now, listen, Ziggy, not her.
She's the best stenographer I ever had. -All right, Jack. -Here, here.
You will buzz the little giant?
I'll tell him...
...but I doubt he'll be interested.
He's missing a great opportunity.
Yes, I know. But, well, I'll drop you a line about it.
Perhaps tomorrow. Wire me, will you?
Well, if you'd rather hear the sad news sooner, I'll wire.
Yes.
They won't give us our share of the profits?
All right!
Open him in Boston jump him to New Orleans, and then on to Frisco.
Funny thing, Billings.
You just can't be nice to some people. Yes, that's what I was thinking.
Ziegfeld was just here.
What did he want?
Remember when he stole Anna Held right from under my nose?
Then, so I couldn't get her back, he married her and made enough to retire.
Now he comes back, broke again asking me to ask you for the money to put on a new show!
Well, that's nerve.
What do you want me to do?
Give him the money.
Cantor and Will Rogers! -$50 a pair!
Best show in town! -Tickets, boys? And gentlemen?
Get up those steps! Come on! You realize this is opening night?
You take that brace and put it down here!
What is it? I've only got two minutes.
You ready to go in with those steps?
I've built so many steps for Ziegfeld, they go in by themselves.
What follows this number? -The--
I know, Greg Williams.
Have the finale costumes arrived?
Mr. Sampston's talking to the costumer now.
Oh, I see. Trouble again.
You can't do this! It's an unheard-of procedure!
I'm very sorry, Mr. Sampston, I want my money.
It's preposterous! Ridiculous!
No money, no finale costumes.
It's a holdup! Oh, hello.
You can't do this to Mr. Ziegfeld.
Wait here a minute. -Allen!
Yes, sir. -Where's Ziegfeld?
Haven't seen him in 1 0 minutes.
See if he's in the front.
Yes, sir.
No, no, I'll go. No, no, you go.
No, no, send somebody else.
Yes, sir.
Joe!
Tell him I must see him immediately.
The show depends on it.
This is going to be the death of me.
This is awful.
Wait here for me. You will wait?
You bet I will.
Hello, Sam.
You look kind of worried.
What's on your mind, Sam?
I was looking for Mr. Ziegfeld.
Just a minute, Sam.
Mr. Ziegfeld, it's very important.
The costumer's-- Will, the audiences love to hear you talk.
Well, shucks, Flo.
I can't talk any more than I do. Gotta get the rope tricks in, don't I?
I think they like to hear your wisecracks better.
Perhaps they do, but what will I talk about?
I ain't got anything to say that's funny. -Mr. Ziegfeld--
Now wait a minute, Sam.
Your wife tells me you keep her laughing all the time just about things you read in the papers.
I catch on. Betty's been putting you up to this, huh?
Well, I got a sort of a habit of telling her all I know is what I read in the papers and she says that's what I ought to tell the audience.
Just sort of be kind of a running gag item.
She's right.
Oh, sure, Betty's always right.
But she don't have to stand on the stage and catch those overripe tomatoes...
...if the gag don't work. -Mr. Ziegfeld, I must interrupt you.
The finale costumes are here.
Oh, good. -Will you do it?
I might.
They won't leave without the money.
Give them a check. -Will you do it tonight?
They want the cash.
They sent the costumes for this show COD?
No, sir, not this show.
They want some money on the last show. Reckon you got your shows mixed up?
Well, I reckon. A little.
If I can help you out on anything, why, let me know.
Thanks, Bill. I'm all right.
Well, tell me if I can.
Of course, I don't suppose it makes a lot of difference, because even with the costumes on, girls in this show ain't exactly overdressed.
You save your wisecracks for the audience, Bill. -Hey, buddy!
Your opening night, your big chance, and you're still moving scenery?
I can't help it, Mr. Ziegfeld.
It gets in the blood.
Besides, I don't know how I'm gonna go over tonight.
I don't wanna lose a job till I'm sure of the other.
When I hired you as an actor, I fired you as a stagehand.
Better make good. You'll find yourself without any job.
Well, what seems to be the trouble?
No trouble, I hope, except--
Except he's holding us up!
He refuses to leave the costumes unless--
Unless he gets some money, and he's right.
Let me see them first. At once, Mr. Ziegfeld.
Open up the basket.
I tell you, Mr. Ziegfeld, these dresses are wonderful.
The finest work I have ever done.
Look, Mr. Ziegfeld, isn't it stunning?
Perhaps you made a mistake.
This isn't for me.
Oh, yes, Mr. Ziegfeld, for the finale.
Not my finale.
Mr. Schutz, this is the New Amsterdam Theatre.
This is the Follies.
I know, Mr. Ziegfeld, and this is the costume for the finale.
Well, not for my show.
Why, I couldn't let my girls appear in a thing like that.
That's horrible!
Oh, take it away.
But, Mr. Ziegfeld, they were made from the sketches of your own designer.
You yourself made the changes on the sketches when you gave me the order.
I never ordered that. That's terrible!
Take it away, take it out of my theater!
But, Mr. Ziegfeld, I worked over three weeks on these dresses.
I have plenty of money invested in them.
I'm sorry, but I can't help that.
What do you want to do? Disgrace me?
No, no, Mr. Ziegfeld.
But please do not disgrace me.
I mean, Mr. Ziegfeld, please let your girls wear my costumes tonight.
No, I wouldn't humiliate them.
If you aren't satisfied, I'll make it up to you, but please don't make me take them back.
All right, but just this once.
Send them up to the dressing rooms.
See me in my office next week. -Next month.
Next month. Thank you very much, Mr. Ziegfeld.
They are beautiful, aren't they?
Awfully expensive.
All right, girls, places for the melody number!
He's singing very well tonight, Mr. Ziegfeld.
He's all right, but there's too much white.
Merv, he's too white.
Bring up the pink in your footlights.
Are the steps high enough for you this time, Mr. Ziegfeld?
No, I don't think so.
We could use more, a lot more. -I'd like to see them higher. -How's that, Mr. Ziegfeld?
That's perfect now. Keep it that way the rest of the number.
Don't you like your flowers, honey lamb? -They're beautiful. Was there a card?
Oh, sure. Here it is.
And there was a package too. I done unwrapped it for you.
Oh, no, honey lamb, I never. -Pour me a drink, Flossie. -Another?
Ain't you all forgetting you got a midnight show to do on the roof tonight?
And ain't you all forgetting to pour that drink?
Well, scratch my back, honey.
Is them diamonds, or is them stars?
Who do you think? I know. They's from Mr. Zieg--
Here he is.
Tell him to come in. Yes'm.
Audrey. -You were beautiful tonight.
Flossie, pour us a drink. No, no, no, please, dear, no.
Somebody else thought you were beautiful too, oui? From an old friend.
Not too old, I hope.
What a beautiful bracelet, Audrey.
Is this from your old friend too?
Do you like it? -Yes, it's charming!
You know, your friend must have very good taste because this is just the sort of jewelry Flo would like.
I told you someday you will have lots of diamonds, didn't I?
Yes, you did.
And I told you I wouldn't suffer, remember?
Yes I do.
Well, congratulations again, Audrey.
I'll see you later.
On the roof, oui?
She's really quite beautiful, Flo, oui?
Yes, she is, isn't she?
You're very much interested in her, oui?
I'm interested in all my girls, dear.
But maybe a tiny, little bit more in her, oui?
A lot more.
She's very unusual. -Yes.
I could make a great star out of her, if she'd only let me.
Ladies and gentlemen!
On behalf of the rest of the company, I've been asked to make a little speech.
Well, you see, I have a confession to make.
Little Audrey is a wee bit tight tonight.
No, but seriously, you really shouldn't applaud all of us because everything we've done we owe to Flo.
You see, I was just a little chorus girl when Flo discovered me.
He taught me how to walk and how to dress and how to smile.
So.... Well....
I am afraid you must forgive Miss Lane tonight.
She just passed through many weeks of very tedious rehearsals.
And the nervous strain of an opening night.
On behalf of my company, I want to thank you.
You've been very kind to my girls and my stars.
And speaking of stars there's a young lady here tonight who, in my opinion is destined to reach the top of her profession.
She doesn't work for me, I'm sorry to say but I'm very proud of her.
She's here tonight with her producer, lucky fellow. And if she will, I'm going to ask Sally Manners to take a bow.
Nice of him to pay my star a tribute, isn't it?
Yes, it is.
I hope you've got her on a long contract.
Are you ready, Mr. Ziegfeld?
All ready.
Now, you'll be signing the contract but look in the camera.
The picture wouldn't be right without the Manners smile.
All right? All right, shoot!
Those things horrify me.
I think we're both to be congratulated.
I feel it's a great opportunity. -Thank you.
Sage, if you'll take Miss Manners and the boys into your office, I'm sure she'll have things to say.
I could tell them how happy I am now.
May I congratulate you? -Thank you.
Where's that girl you said was my friend?
You told them out there that you were a friend of mine, huh?
Yes, I did. Well, I see.
Just to get into my office, huh?
Smart girl.
Well, I am a friend of yours.
Have you forgotten me?
No, no, of course not.
I remember you very well.
Who am I?
As if I didn't know.
Do you? Of course.
I always remember the time, the place and the girl.
It was....
Atlantic City.
No? -No. Well, that's funny.
I seem to remember a chair on a boardwalk you beside me and....
Are you sure it wasn't Atlantic City?
Now I remember!
Why, it was right here in this office.
You came up to see me about a year ago.
Oh, now it all comes back to me. Well, how are you?
Where have you been?
No.
You don't seem to remember the time, the place or the girl.
Mary Lou!
Well, how's my girl?
How's my fella? Well, my little Mary Lou is a big girl now, isn't she?
Yes, indeed, a very big girl.
Aren't you glad to see me?
Yes, I certainly am!
Even if I wasn't at Atlantic City with you? Don't be silly.
I knew you all the time.
Now, fibber....
Well, how long you been in New York?
One day. -One day.
You seen my father lately? -Yes, just before I left.
Oh, that reminds me, he told me to give you a big kiss. Well.
You know, I think that in all fairness...
I should tell you I am a married man now.
Yes, I know. I read about it.
It nearly broke my heart.
But being married in New York doesn't mean anything, does it?
Oh, yes, it does, young lady.
Now, why are you here, and what can I do for you?
Well, first of all, I want to give you a big kiss for all the candy you sent me.
You've already done that twice.
Now, what else?
Well, I want to go into the Follies.
You do?
I've been taking dancing lessons two years.
Yeah? -How do your father and mother feel?
I haven't a father and mother anymore.
I'm so sorry, my dear.
Of course, Jimmy won't like it.
Who's Jimmy?
Just another fellow I've been engaged to.
Oh, well....
All right, I think we can look after you.
Do you think we can have dinner tonight?
Oh, Alice! -Yes, sir.
Take this lady down to the stage and tell Julian to put her on as an extra dancer.
Oh, gee, thank you!
Mary Lou is an old friend of mine from Chicago, and she's a stranger here.
So I'd like you to sort of look after her. -Yes, sir.
This way, dear.
Oh, may I say one thing before I go?
Well, yes, of course. What?
I forgive you for not marrying me.
All right.
Goodbye.
Hello. Pardon me.
Hello, Alice.
Say, Flo! I know!
You got a new song.
I'll say we have.
Play him the melody, Danny.
Oh, you'll go crazy over this, Flo.
Mr. Ziegfeld. I must interrupt you.
This is important.
I got an idea. -How much will it save?
This has nothing to do with money.
Feeling all right?
My usual headache, but this is about talent.
Good and cheap, no doubt? -Exactly.
A young lady, the name of Brice. -Fannie Brice.
She's working in burlesque.
I've seen that gal, Flo.
Pretty? -Well, yes and no.
Shut your eyes and listen, yes.
Open them and look, no. -But a great performer.
Shall I take your coat?
Why not? You bought it for me.
I gave it to you because you've been behaving yourself this week.
What are you going to give me next week?
Watch the show. -I don't see how you can find great stars in a place like this.
Some of our greatest stars have come from places like this.
Well, of course, not being a star yet, I wouldn't know.
You can, if you behave yourself.
What's on now, Fannie?
Jim Boss. -If that guy's funny, I'll be a--
That guy's gonna be a big star someday.
He can make you laugh and make you cry.
Yeah, and he can make me sick.
Comics bore me. You give me a pain in the neck too, always telling me who's gonna be a great star.
Once in burlesque, always in burlesque.
Unless you got looks or a voice or something.
Well, that's what I got, kid.
What? -Something.
On the level you don't hope to get out of burlesque?
You're good here because these people are from 1 0th Avenue.
How good do you think you'd be on Fifth Avenue?
Half as good.
Another silk stocking gone. I'll never buy anything from those stage-door peddlers again.
That's what you said before.
What'd you let the fella in for? Here.
He told the stage doorman his name was Belasco.
And you thought it was the Mr. Belasco, the producer.
Calling personally to see you?
Well, maybe I was a little optimistic.
Miss Brice, Mr. Ziegfeld is here to see you.
Another peddler.
First it's Belasco, now it's Ziegfeld.
Tell Mr. Ziegfeld I'm not in, and if I was in, tell him I wouldn't see him.
And if I did see him, tell him I wouldn't buy a thing.
Yes, miss. -Thank you.
Miss Brice? I hope I'm not intruding.
I'm Florenz Ziegfeld.
Is that so?
Sarah, this is Mr. Ziegfeld.
Mr. Ziegfeld, this is Sarah Bernhardt.
Not the Sarah Bernhardt? Well....
A pleasure to run into you.
If you run into your friend Belasco tell him about the runs in his stockings.
Do you know David Belasco?
Better than you know Ziegfeld.
Well, come on, what do you want for it?
I'm not interested. Miss Brice, I am here to offer you a great opportunity.
That's what they all say. What kind of fur is this?
This?
That's mink.
That so?
And what's the price?
Well, the original cost was $2700.
Who cares from originals? Copies is just as good.
Come on, I'll try it on.
Yes, of course. As a matter of fact, it ought to fit you very well.
Don't give me the talk, just tell me the price.
I don't wanna buy it, but I'll give you $50 for it.
And not a cent more.
Miss Brice, the coat is yours.
Stuck again. -Fannie!
Are you really gonna buy it?
If I can give Belasco 4 dollars for silk stockings made of cotton I can give Ziegfeld more for a mink coat made of skunk.
Besides, a bargain's a bargain. Here.
Here's your $40.
Get out before I change my mind.
Fannie!
Fannie!
What?
Fannie, look!
What? Moths already?
No, feel!
It's real mink.
How do you know?
I've been promised one often enough to tell.
It's real mink, all right.
It's probably stolen goods.
You mean it's hot?
Of course it's warm.
Then I'll be arrested if I keep it?
Of course you will. Call the stage manager!
Call the police! Call my mother!
Come in.
Message for Miss Brice.
I'm dying. "Dear Fannie Brice.
I can't accept your $40, but you can please me by accepting the coat.
I shall expect you at my office in the New Amsterdam tomorrow as I want to engage you for the Follies.
Florenz Ziegfeld Jr."
Fannie, it was him! It was Ziegfeld!
How do you like that?
I like it. Fannie!
Fannie! Have you fainted? Can't you see I have, you chump?
Get me some whiskey!
Oh, Miss Brice?
Yes, sir?
We're ready for you.
I'm coming right down. Yes, sir, I'll be right down.
I'm coming as fast as I can. I thought I had more time.
Don't lose your nerve, kid. This is your big chance.
Be a trouper! Look at you.
You're working for Ziegfeld now.
And you look like a million dollars. For the first time in your life, you're class, you mug.
Wait a minute!
Ho! What in the--? Fannie!
What in the world are you made up for?
Veronica? Clarence?
Anything I can do, Mr. Ziegfeld?
Yes. Come here, will you?
Yes, Mr. Ziegfeld?
Will you rip off that train?
But, Mr. Ziegfeld! -Go ahead.
Take off the hat.
Get rid of this boa constrictor. Now, will you get me a shawl?
An old shawl.
Yes, sir.
How do you expect Miss Brice to sing a sad song about her man dressed up like a nightingale?
I find personalities, you try to destroy them. I didn't engage Miss Brice as a showgirl.
Is that all right, Mr. Ziegfeld?
Well, that's all right for now.
Tomorrow, buy her another outfit.
Go to a secondhand store and get her an old dress. She's supposed to be an apache, a poor French girl, an urchin.
So to work for Ziegfeld, I gotta be an urchin.
Even in burlesque, I was middle class.
Now let me see this, Fannie.
Fannie?
Sing the song. Now! Vic?
If she can turn those tears on in front of an audience, she'll be a sensation.
Look.
Mr. Ziegfeld, shall we get back to that conference?
The boys are still waiting, you know. Yeah, yeah.
She's all right.
She's gonna be great.
Who's that?
Brice. Fannie Brice.
I've got a great spot for her in this show.
And I discovered her!
That's right, Sam, and you deserve a raise.
And I'd give it to him, but I'm afraid he wouldn't approve of the expense.
How's it look, Gene?
It's the best we've ever done.
You're the best author.
Herbert's the best composer. Julian's the best director.
Joe's the best artist.
Sam's the best bookkeeper. I'm dying to hear it.
We open on a street in Cairo.
We open on a street in Cairo.
Along comes a man leading an elephant.
Wait just a minute, Gene. -Can you boys stand a shock?
Well, what do you mean, Flo?
I hate to tell you this because I know how hard you've worked....
But I've decided not to do another Follies.
What?
I'm going on with this new edition with Brice but after that I wanna do a story.
Something with a plot.
Something with all the glamour of the Follies, around a sweet, simple story.
Something that will fit this little girl Sally Manners.
We might call it Sally.
Oh, Jerry.
Hello, Flo. How are you?
I was just thinking of you.
It's nice to be thought of.
Hello, boys. -Hello. Remember that melody you played at my house a few weeks ago?
I played several. -And they were all beautiful.
But this one was....
You remember?
You were going to send it to me. Oh, I know.
Look for the Silver Lining."
That's the one. Come on, play it.
Do you mind?
Sure, I will.
I've got the lyrics right here.
Get this.
See what I mean?
That's what I want. A story just as simple and sweet as that tune.
Sing it, Jerry, will you?
Ziegfeld these gentlemen are pestering me about money for scenery, costumes and whatnot.
And I wanna tell you in their presence, I have no interest in this show and in no way am I concerned with it.
Our agreement is for Ziegfeld Follies and nothing else.
You understand that, gentlemen?
Nothing else.
Mr. Ziegfeld, this is very unpleasant at a rehearsal but we insist on at least 50 percent of our money before opening.
We are selling a lot of tickets. -Sampston, that's our best proposition.
Mr.
Ziegfeld, we're ready for the finale.
All right, Benny.
Boys, what are you worried about?
Have I started anything I couldn't finish?
Don't my curtains always go up? Why, if I owed you 1 00 times the amount I do, you'd get it.
Come to me tomorrow, I'll pay you.
50 percent, Mr. Ziegfeld.
A hundred percent if you want it.
Maybe I can give you an advance on the Eddie Cantor show.
I'm doing a story with him too.
How are you gonna do it?
I don't know.
Mr. Ziegfeld, Audrey Dane is visiting backstage and she brought a lot of champagne with her.
Yes, sir?
Never mind. -It looks very good, the show, huh?
I'll be back in a moment, darling.
I wanna see every one of you in my office in the morning.
Audrey, you know I've forbidden drinking in the dressing rooms.
Oh, Flo, don't be mad at me.
I just asked the girls up to have a drink.
It isn't their fault. You see, it's my f--
Now, Audrey, please.
Please stand up now. I can't. I wanna get down, but I can't get down.
Oh, don't put me down.
Don't put me down. Audrey, you've broken your last promise to me.
You should have at least closed the door.
Wait!
Anna, please don't misjudge me.
I couldn't help it.
She's drunk.
Do you always do that when she's drunk? The members of your company must enjoy that very much.
Oh, Anna, don't say that.
Don't you understand, dear?
When one of my girls--
Poor Flo. You have so much trouble with your girls, oui?
Anna!
Aren't you going to eat your grapefruit, sir?
Well, we know now why she didn't come home last night.
I'm sorry, sir.
Did you send the flowers?
The minute I learned the address.
A dozen orchids as usual.
Mr. Sampston called again, sir.
He says the bank positively refuses to increase your loans.
Thank you, Sidney.
Miss Dane, sir.
Here?
Show her in, Sidney.
Well, Flo, congratulations.
On what?
I don't think I'm to be congratulated, Audrey.
Little Audrey is speaking out of turn again.
And I was a bad girl last night too.
I don't think you should have come here.
So that's how you feel.
Going to Atlantic City tonight?
No.
Isn't the show opening there tomorrow?
No.
Broke again?
Please don't turn the elephant, Audrey.
Afraid I'll spoil your luck? So nobody thinks enough of your new star to loan you money.
I don't blame them.
Why didn't you star me in the show?
You, with all your promises.
Audrey, if you'll just behave yourself, I'll put your name on Broadway."
Audrey, if you'll only stop drinking, I'll have great shows written for you."
Why didn't you make me a great star?
I couldn't depend on you, as I could on-- -Yes! Well, all right.
Depend on her now. Go on, star her.
Do anything you like with her. I hate you!
I'm never gonna see you again.
I'm quitting you and your show.
I hope you don't get the money to open it.
And if you do, I hope it's a flop!
That's how I feel about you!
Sidney?
Yes, sir?
Will that be all, Mr. Billings?
Yes, that'll be all, thank you.
Miss Jones, take care of that right away.
I got another telegram from Ziegfeld.
He can't open his show unless we help him.
We won't help him.
I told him so yesterday. I'm not interested, and I won't loan him 5 cents.
Send him a wire--
I just did.
Did what?
Wired him the money.
Isn't that Mr. Ziegfeld?
Say, Flo, why don't you go put on the costume...
...and get into the spirit of the dance.
I'm tired, Gene. Come on, Flo. Don't lose interest in everything.
No, I'm going home.
Good night.
Let me have that megaphone, honey.
Yes, sir. -Willie.
Flo, you're not leaving.
Yes, I am.
We're starting a Paul Jones inside and I promise whenever you get a pretty girl, I'll blow the whistle.
Say, who is that girl with the gorgeous red hair?
Thanks, Willie.
Good evening, Jack.
How do you do?
Willie.
Yes, Flo? -I'm staying for the Paul Jones.
Whenever you see me with Miss Burke, blow the whistle.
Take your places for the Paul Jones, everybody.
The Paul Jones!
Well, do you think we ought to?
I-- -Oh, yes.
I love the Paul Jones. -Perhaps we could both go the same way.
No, we can't do that!
Miss Burke.
Mister...?
Oh, no, I'm supposed to-- I've got to-
We're not-- -Oh, no, this is our dance.
Miss Burke.
We meet again, Mister...?
It still doesn't matter.
Won't you tell me?
Tell you what?
Your name.
Why don't you ask Mr. Billings.
I will, if I can find him. But you seem to stand in with the whistle.
Oh, yes, when I was a little boy, I used to love to whistle and a whistle never forgets.
Aren't you getting bored?
No. Are you?
I'm afraid not.
Tired?
Are you? -No, but I'd much rather just talk.
Would you mind?
Don't you love the lights of New York?
For me, they're more beautiful than any landscape.
More beautiful than the mountains?
Yes, I think so. -Are you too cold out here?
No, indeed. I'm enjoying it.
That is, I.... I mean, the electric signs fascinate me.
Wrigley's Chewing Gum, Fleischmann's Yeast, Ziegfeld's Follies."
Do you know Ziegfeld?
No, I don't want to. -I understand he's a horrible person.
Horrible?
Yes, they say he's a terrible lady's man.
Well, I suppose that's forgivable.
He's surrounded by so many beautiful women.
Yes, yes. Strange you've never met him.
I don't want to.
I love his shows. They're so beautiful and in such good taste.
It would disappoint me to meet him and find him to be a fat, pudgy man with a big stomach.
He's not fat and not really so pudgy.
No? You know him? -Oh, yes.
He would like you.
How do you know?
Didn't you just say he had good taste? Well, you're sort of a lady's man yourself, aren't you?
I think with you as the lady, I could make Ziegfeld look like an amateur.
You haven't told me your name yet.
If you don't mind, Mr. Ziegfeld Miss Burke, with the permission of her producer came here with me tonight.
And if you've no objection, I'd like to have one dance.
Mr. Ziegfeld? Well, you were right.
He isn't pudgy.
Shall we go in?
Yes! -Don't I get one more dance?
I'm afraid not.
I imagine it's Mr. Frohman you're really afraid of, isn't it?
Oh, I'm....
Perhaps. He doesn't want you to appear too much socially.
Frankly, no, he doesn't.
And you don't like me very well anyway, do you?
Frankly, no, I don't.
You put him in his place, all right.
What would Gen. Grant think if he knew we were using the very shadow of his tomb as our meeting place?
Well, I never knew the general personally, but I have an idea he'd approve.
I don't know.
Nobody else seems to. At least, Mr. Frohman doesn't.
And why not?
Why can't we meet where we like?
Go where we want?
Just because he has you under contract is no reason he should dictate your personal life.
I'm here. -Yes, and so am I.
But it must seem like kindergarten to you.
Why?
The great Mr. Ziegfeld, producer of the Follies surrounded by hundreds of beautiful women sitting on a bench, holding hands watching the riverboats go back and forth.
Doesn't sound a bit like you, does it?
No, it doesn't.
But here I am, sitting on a bench holding hands and watching the riverboats go back and forth.
And regretting all the years I haven't known you.
Didn't Anna Held take up a few of those years?
Yes, Billie, she did.
She was truly a wonderful woman.
I love you for saying that.
Look, there's another ferryboat going across to the Palisades.
Will you keep your eyes on it while I tell you something?
Must I look at a ferryboat to listen to you?
Yes, or I won't be able to tell you.
You mean the great lady's man is bashful?
Strange as it may seem, in your presence, he is.
All right, I'm looking.
I love you, Billie.
I haven't anything to offer you, because there's nothing you really seem to need.
You've made the most of yourself unassisted, and that's grand.
You're a great star already, so there's little I can offer you.
Nothing I can give you, except my love.
That isn't enough.
I'd expect part of your ambition, half of your trouble two-thirds of your worries and all of your respect.
Here's your medicine, madame.
No, thank you, Marie.
I'm tired of it.
But, madame....
Perhaps you would like to go to Paris?
No, I'm too tired to go anywhere and to do anything.
Marie....
Look at the paper and tell me where did they go on their honeymoon?
But they couldn't go anywhere, madame.
Miss Burke is appearing in a play here.
We saw her only two weeks ago.
You insisted, madame.
You remember. Oui, I know. And we enjoyed it very much too.
She's a lovely actress, Marie, oui?
She has such twinkling eyes and such a funny little twitter when she speaks.
Yes, I can well imagine Flo being in love with her.
Marie?
Call his office.
I will congratulate him.
Hello? Brian 3093, please.
I should wish him luck, oui? -Oui, I should.
Mr. Ziegfeld, please.
Miss Anna Held speaking.
No, Marie, hang up!
I cannot speak with him today! -Mr. Ziegfeld?
He's on the telephone, madame. He is?
Hello, Flo.
Yes, here's Anna.
I'm so happy for you today.
I could not help but call on you and congratulate you.
Wonderful, Flo. Never better in my whole life.
I'm so excited about my new plans.
I'm going to Paris.
Yes, for a few weeks, and then I can get back and then I'm doing a new show, and I--
Oui, it's all so wonderful.
I'm so happy. Yes, and I hope you are happy too.
Yes? I'm so glad for you, Flo.
It sounds funny for ex-husband and ex-wife to tell each other how happy they are, oui?
Yes, Flo.
Goodbye, Flo. Goodbye.
If you love him so much, why did you divorce him?
Because I thought it would bring him back to me.
I was sure that it would bring him back to me.
Goody, goody, goody! Is that all for me?
That certainly is, every bit for you.
And that isn't all. Sidney?
Yes, sir?
Now, if you don't like the view from this side...
...then-- -I don't.
That's the chimney Santa came down.
Yes! -That's where the reindeer stopped.
I wonder how they kept from sliding off.
Probably the bricks stopped them.
See, Mommy, it's almost big enough for me to get in.
It is!
It's almost big enough for us all to get in.
Oh, yes! Sidney....
Yes, sir?
Hasn't Santa Claus brought the elephant yet?
Not yet, sir, but he, she- - It may be here at any moment, sir.
You didn't buy an elephant?
I did.
A live elephant, Daddy? -A great big, live elephant.
I beg your pardon, sir, madam.
In behalf of the help, and as their spokesman I wish to express our thanks for your thoughtfulness and generosity and to wish you a very merry Christmas.
Thank you.
That's very nice, Sidney. And may we wish a very merry Christmas to all of you.
Thank you, sir. Thank you, madam.
Merry Christmas. And to you, Miss Patricia.
Same to you, Sidney.
Now, how about opening your presents?
With all this extravagance, I'm a little afraid to.
Nonsense, darling, that's what Christmas is for.
Come on, now.
Oh, Flo.
Now. -This isn't all for me?
Well, who else?
I don't know which one to open first.
Well, suppose you try this one.
Oh, Flo! A crown of diamonds.
How beautiful.
This proves that America is not a republic.
Because you are the queen, and queens always wear crowns.
A bracelet for the regal wrist.
A pendant for the royal throat.
And....
Flo!
A cloak for Her Majesty's shoulders.
Darling!
And....
Oh, no, Flo.
Nothing else! -Yes. A kiss from her most humble subject.
Darling! Oh, everything's so lovely.
But you shouldn't have done so much.
Oh, well, I.... I hadn't anything to do with it.
It was Santa Claus. He brought everything.
Yes, I know, but Santa Claus was far too extravagant.
You should take some of it back.
Oh, Mama, I don't want Santa Claus to take back any of my presents.
Don't worry, he won't.
No, and he won't take back any of your mama's either.
I'd cry if he took my circus back.
You would? -Why, darling?
You like it better than your other presents?
But I wish it was a real, live circus.
Well, I guess you'll have to do a circus, Flo.
Could you, Daddy?
Well, I don't know. Let's see.
I've never had any experience with circuses.
But I can try.
I'll tell you what. Let's make a chorus in front of these two wagons.
Who's this fellow?
That's the ringmaster in the center, where a ringmaster should be.
Now, we'll put these two acrobats up next to him then we'll put this Tyrollean fellow there.
Put the clown next to him.
He's a funny fellow, and there's the lion-tamer. Gosh, I bet he's a brave fellow too.
And there's the drum major.
And here is the strongman. We'll call him Sandow.
And who is this?
Well, that's.... Oh! Of course.
That's little Harriet Hoctor. I've always wanted to give her a chance.
I'll tell you what.
Now, you hold her for a minute, and we'll bring her on later.
Now let's put it all back of a curtain, just as I do in the theater.
Now, this is the curtain.
What's the laugh, Jack?
This article on Ziegfeld.
Says he's broke and can't borrow a nickel from any bank.
He wouldn't have to borrow if he'd commercialized.
He'd never send out a number two company.
He wanted the public to see his best production.
Why doesn't he stick to his Follies?
That other show is terrible.
Guess the old boy's washed-up.
He's been slipping for years.
White and Carroll have got it all over him.
Bob.... Let me have a cold towel, will you?
Well, the guy's getting old.
Yeah, and broke.
He won't have another hit on Broadway.
Isn't someone making a theater for him?
Yeah. It's to be his monument.
It's about time.
He could use a monument.
I don't know you fellows.
You got nothing on me. I don't know you.
You ought to. You've been burying me for five minutes.
I'm Ziegfeld. You're right.
I'm not gonna have another hit on Broadway.
I'm gonna have four.
Four at one time.
You get that? Four!
And all hits.
Oh, Mr. Ziegfeld!
You forgot your tie.
He's gonna have four hits, and he hasn't got a tie left.
Flo.
Darling.
Why did you come upstairs without saying hello?
Well, I'm not feeling very well, dear.
Poor darling. You're just tired.
Where's your tie?
What do you think of that? I....
I must have left it in the barbershop this afternoon.
And you've been around without it ever since?
Darling, that isn't like you.
What's wrong, Flo?
Billie, I'm all through.
Through with what?
Everything. I'm slipping.
I'm getting old.
And who told you that?
Three men in the barbershop.
That's why you forgot your tie.
Yes, I've never done anything like that in my whole life.
Isn't that tragic?
For the first time in your long career, you forgot a tie.
It's a calamity.
Who were those men, Flo?
I don't know. I never saw them before.
They said I'd never produce another hit.
And what did you say?
I told them I'd have four on Broadway at the same time.
Sounds more like you.
Yeah, but it was only a bluff.
I'm sorry, dear. I don't mean to worry you.
Where's Patricia?
She's having her dinner.
You came home very late, dear.
Yes, dear. I'm sorry. I....
I've been so worried.
The play is such a terrible failure.
But you're not, darling.
Afraid I am.
Well, shall we have some dinner?
Flo. I'm disappointed in you.
I didn't think you'd ever lose confidence in yourself.
But I must be the failure, not you.
Oh, Billie.
No, I mean it, darling.
Before we were married you never thought of failure even when you were broke.
It was your sublime superiority more than anything else that made me admire you so much.
Please don't change, Flo.
Don't let Patricia and me become a worry to you.
We don't expect you to reduce your life to just us.
I want you to go right on being just as you always were.
I would never be jealous because with your love of beauty, you could never be cheap or common.
So in whatever you do you need never fear me.
And what is more important don't be afraid of yourself.
I'm not gonna be afraid, Billie.
All right, young man. I'll give you a chance to prove it.
In my vault, I have all the jewelry you've ever given me even the queen's crown and some very good bonds.
They're all yours on one condition.
That you keep your promise to those three men and have four hits on Broadway.
Is that a bargain?
Oh, Billie.
Mr. Ziegfeld.
Just a minute.
Mr. Ziegfeld, it's Police Inspector Doyle. He says it's important.
Why didn't you say so?
Send him in.
All right, Mr. Doyle.
Mr. Ziegfeld.
Hello, inspector.
We got them, all right.
You did?
That's wonderful.
It is wonderful, with the descriptions you gave us.
Where are they?
Right outside.
Bring them in.
All right, sir.
Bring those birds in here.
Here they are.
What's going on?
Pipe down, pipe down.
What's the charge against these men?
Murder.
Murder?
Yes, murder.
About a year ago, these three gentlemen killed me and buried me.
Killed? Buried? -Yes.
In a Times Square barbershop. -Remember?
Oh, yes, I remember. Don't you?
Now, I'm going to give each of you a box to all four of my shows.
Four hits, all in one season.
And then I want you to tell me whether or not you still think I'm washed-up.
I'm sorry, but this is the only way I could locate you.
I knew that if you were to be found at all, Inspector Doyle was the one to do it.
Sam, have Goldie take their reservations for whatever nights they wish.
Good day, gentlemen.
This way.
Thank you.
That's getting even with a vengeance.
That's not a bad ending for a practical joke, is it?
Goldie, take these gentlemen's names and addresses.
Don't you realize what you may have let yourself in for?
What?
They can sue you for false arrest.
And the police department.
Don't you realize we have nothing... -...to worry about anymore?
I hope so.
No need to hope.
You know what I've been doing?
What?
Buying stocks. I've bought over a million.
Outright?
No, on margin.
But all solid securities.
When I've paid for them, I'm gonna buy another million and another.
Sam, I'm going to be really rich.
I hope you're right, sir.
But the market's been behaving very queerly these last few days.
Yes?
Croydon  Company on the phone.
Put them on.
Been trying to get you.
They're my broker.
Hello?
Oh. Well, what happened?
Down 20 to 40 points?
How much?
Three hundred thousand?
Oh, no, no, no! Don't do that!
I'll cover. I'll get the money to you in just a little while.
Will you put Holloway on the phone?
The market, Sam, it's crashed.
I've got to get $300,000 in cash, immediately.
How are we gonna do it?
I don't know.
Maybe I could borrow it from a bank.
On what?
On your shows.
It's too late. I've already mortgaged the shows for the first payments on the stock.
What's that?
But you've got to locate him!
Yes, I'll cover.
I'll get the money to you in a while. Just hold the wire.
Sam, get Billings.
Yes, sir.
Try his house, his office, anywhere, but get Billings!
Mr. Nagus, we haven't received your check, and your margin's wiped out.
Hello, Mr. Billings.
I'll be right with you.
No, we can't, Mr. Nagus.
I'm sorry, but we can't hold your stocks any longer.
Mr. Billings, we've had to sell you out too.
Well, that takes me back to my second childhood consistently.
I was a poor kid when I started.
Mr. Ziegfeld's on number six for you.
Excuse me, Mr. Billings.
Hello? Oh, yes, Mr. Ziegfeld.
Yes, we had to sell you out about half an hour ago.
I know it is, and I'm terribly sorry.
I didn't know Ziegfeld was in the market.
Yes, very heavy. -He'll lose everything.
Everything?
Everything.
Well, this is one time he can't get it from me.
Yes, madam.
Yes, madam, it is.
The doctor left about 10 minutes ago, madam.
He seemed very happy about Mr. Ziegfeld.
Said he might stay up for a while longer.
Oh, he did so enjoy sitting up to dinner with you and Miss Patricia.
No, madam.
But don't let him stay up too long.
Yes, I know, but the more he rests, the sooner he'll be well again.
And tell him I'll be home immediately after the performance.
It's time for your entrance, Miss Burke.
Yes, yes.
Sidney, be sure to call me right after the second act.
Yes, about 1 0:05.
Yes, madam.
Madam was very happy about you, sir.
Oh, my poor Billie.
I wish she weren't working.
But it does help some, Sidney.
Get those wires off as quickly as you can. -Yes, sir.
Were you able to reach Eddie Cantor by phone?
The Los Angeles operator's been trying for some time, sir.
Tell her to keep on trying.
Sidney? -Yes, sir?
When you get him tell him that I want him for a new show.
Tell him I'll start rehearsals the instant he can get away from those pictures.
Tell him I need him.
I haven't had a real show in two years. -Yes, sir.
Wasn't that the bell, Sidney? -Yes, sir.
Well, why don't you answer it.
Yes, sir.
Mr. Billings.
Hello, Sidney.
How's Mr. Ziegfeld?
Well, he's much improved, sir, but he's very nervous.
He will be glad to see you, sir.
If we could get him started on a new show, sir. -Yeah.
I mean to say, if he had the money, sir.
Yes, well, we'll see that he gets it.
My valet isn't as efficient as you used to be, Sidney.
He lets me neglect things.
All right for me to see him? -Yes, sir.
I wouldn't stay too long.
No, no, no.
Well, hello, Ziggy.
How are you feeling?
Hello, Jack.
I'm feeling much better. -Thank you.
Sit down, won't you? -Yes.
Let me look at you.
I don't think you've been sick.
Just playing possum so your creditors can't find you.
No. No creditors.
No. No creditors.
When are you gonna be up and around?
Well... -...pretty soon now, I hope.
Hurry up. I'm expecting you to go to Europe with me.
Well, when are you sailing? In a couple of weeks.
We'll stop off at Monte Carlo.
You can break the bank again.
And then we'll go to London. Maybe we can find some new talent together.
Does it interest you? Yes.
Yes, I'd like to go to London.
Yeah? Why?
You got someone in mind? -No.
Why, have you?
No.
But I wouldn't tell you if I had, not if you were 1 0 times as sick as you are.
Oh, those were great old days, Jack.
Yeah.
Remember the fair?
Do I. Little Egypt.
Sandow.
Yeah, and then Anna Held.
Oh, I'm sorry, Ziggy.
Why is it, Jack, that in a world so old life must be so short?
I feel as if I'd been here 1 000 years.
And I'm gonna stay 1 000 more.
And you'd feel the same way if you'd snap out of it and get a new show started.
Yes.
Yes, I'd like to do another Follies.
Why don't you do it.
Don't you think it's about time that you and I split 50-50 in something?
I'd love to, Jack.
But it'll take a lot of money.
I've never refused you before, have I?
No, but that was all in the dark ages.
Before the Depression, I mean.
I heard that the market got you.
Me?
Why, I.... Don't be silly.
I'm too smart for any stock market.
Oh, I lost a couple of thousand or so, but I got out in time.
Really? -Yeah.
How about you?
Did it get you? Oh, no.
No, I.... I never played the market.
Oh, I may have dropped a few hundred, maybe but nothing to speak of.
Well, how much money do you suppose it'll take, Ziggy?
A couple of hundred thousand.
A couple of hundred thousand? Well, okay, it's a deal.
Pull yourself together, get well, and I'll give you money.
Isn't that wonderful, Mr. Ziegfeld? Doesn't that make you feel better, sir?
Yes, that makes me feel much better.
Jack you're a real person.
Yeah, well, you're.... You're not a bad sort yourself, Ziggy.
Well, I'll drop in tomorrow. Yes.
Do that.
And, Ziggy, if you just put your mind to it, I think you'll be up and around in a week.
Don't let me rush you, because while you're here convalescing I'll be picking out the gals for the new show.
Well, he looks all right to me, Sidney.
Undoubtedly he will be, sir.
Thanks to you.
I hope so.
Take good care of him, Sidney.
Because if anything happened to Ziggy, I....
Well, take good care of him.
Mr. Ziegfeld.
Mr. Ziegfeld.
I wouldn't tax my strength if I were you, sir.
Sidney I've got things to do.
I must get Cantor, Bill Rogers, Bill Fields.
They must come back to me!
I'll have all my old stars together in one great show.
I must do the biggest Follies of my whole life!
I....
Oh, Sidney, I'm so terribly broke.
But Mr. Billings, sir, isn't he going to help you?
Sidney, he hasn't a nickel.
He was lying to me just to make me feel better.
We're both broke.
I wouldn't worry about that, sir.
You've been broke before, sir.
Yes, I know.
I've always laughed about it.
But I can't laugh anymore, Sidney because I've been wrong.
I've got nothing.
Nothing to leave anyone. Nothing, sir?
You leave them the memories of the finest things ever done on the stage, sir.
You'll leave them a name that they can be proud of all their lives.
You'll soon feel better and then you can do more beautiful things than ever before, sir.
It's nice of you, Sidney, to say that.
I must call madam again now, sir. It's after 1 0.
The memories of the finest things ever done on the stage.
Chicory 51 61 .
Hello?
Get me Miss Burke's dressing room, please. Yes.
Oh, Miss Burke.
He seems to be resting comfortably.
Yes, I thought you'd like to know.
Yes, Miss Burke.
Yes, I'll deliver your message.
Mr. Ziegfeld.
Mr. Z--
Is Dr. Hassel still in the building, please?
Would you ask him to come up to Mr. Ziegfeld's apartment at once? Yes.
Hurry, please.
I've got to have more steps.
I need more steps.
I've got to get higher.
Higher.
Hello, young Harding. You're early.
Yes, I'd finished up. It was too late to start anything fresh.
What's all this fuss about in the papers tonight, Mr. Cabal?
Wars and rumors of wars.
Crying wolf?
Someday a wolf will come.
These fools are capable of anything.
In that case, what happens to medical research?
It has to stop.
That'll mess me up.
Mess you up?
Mess everything up.
My God!
If war gets loose again -
Happy Christmas, everyone.
What's the matter with you fellows?
Oh, that.
This little upset across the water doesn't mean anything.
Threatened men live long and threatened wars never occur.
Another speech by him.
And I tell you, there's nothing in it.
It's just to buck people up about the air estimates.
Now, why meet wars halfway?
Why not look on the bright side of things?
You're all right. Your business is going up.
You've got a jolly wife, a pretty home.
All's right with the world, eh?
Hmm.
All's right with the world.
Certainly.
Passworthy, you should have been called Pippa Passworthy.
Oh, and, Cabal, you've been smoking too much.
You're not
You're not eupeptic.
Oh, come on.
It's Christmas.
No, don't push me about.
No.
Nice toys they have nowadays. Nice toys.
The toys we had were simpler, ever so much simpler.
Noah's arks and wooden soldiers.
Nothing complex like these.
You know, I wonder sometimes if perhaps all these new toys... aren't a bit too much for them.
It teaches them to use their hands.
And I suppose their grandchildren will see even more wonderful things.
Progress.
Progress.
I'd like to see the wonders they'll see.
Don't be too sure of progress.
Oh, listen to the incurable pessimist.
What's to stop progress nowadays?
War.
Firstly, there isn't going to be a war, and secondly, war doesn't stop progress.
It stimulates progress.
Yes.
War can be a highly stimulating thing.
But you can overdo a stimulant.
Oh, well, after all, aren't we exaggerating the horrors of war?
Don't we rather overdo that song?
After all, you know, the last war wasn't as bad as some people make out.
We didn't worry.
Something
Something great seemed to have got hold of us.
Something greater still may get hold of us next time.
If we don't end war, war will end us.
Well, what can you do?
Yes.
What can we do?
Peace on earth, goodwill towards men.
Real old-fashioned Christmas this year.
Fresh little snow, with a nip in the air, eh?
What was that?
Sounded like a gun.
Oh, no guns here. Merry Christmas, Cabal.
Here's to another good year for all of us.
Another year of recovery, eh?
What are the searchlights doing now?
Yes.
Well, it must be antiaircraft maneuvers.
Maneuvers at Christmas?
No.
Listen.
Guns again.
Yes?
Cabal speaking.
The Hill Town aerodrome at 3:00.
I'll be there.
Mobilization.
Oh, God!
Perhaps it's only precautionary mobilization.
Let's hear the radio.
The unknown aircraft passed over Seabeach... and dropped bombs within a few hundred yards of the waterworks.
They then turned seaward again.
By this time, they'd been picked up by the searchlights of the battleship Diosaur.
Before they could mount out of range, she had opened upon them... with her antiaircraft guns, unfortunately, without result.
Of course, everyone has said this time they'll start without any declaration of war.
Oh, listen.
We do not yet know the nationality of these aircraft... though, of course, there could be little doubt of their place of origin.
But before all things, it is necessary for the country to keep calm.
No doubt' the losses suffered o y the fleet' are serious.
What's that?
Losses of the fleet?
Listen. Listen.
And it is imperative that the whole nation should at once stand to arms.
Orders for a general mobilization have been issued... and the precautionary civilian organization against gas... will at once be put into operation.
Our instructions have just come to hand.
We shall cut off for five minutes, then read you the general instructions.
Please call in all your friends. Call in everyone you can.
You've got your stimulant, Passworthy.
Something great has got you.
War has come.
My God, if they've attacked without a declaration of war, then it's vengeance.
No quarter.
Vengeance.
Punishment, condign punishment... or else the end of civilization altogether.
But it's just possible there's some mistake.
You know, I cling to that.
If not, then it's war to the knife.
No, its - it's not a war.
It's extermination of dangerous vermin.
A vermin hunt without pause or pity.
Well, good night.
Please keep still and listen.
War has broken out suddenly.
There may be an air raid, but it is not likely to be a very serious one.
You must be prepared for it. The danger will not be great.
As soon as the danger is over, bugles will sound all clear.
The streets will be dangerous. Do not assemble in crowds.
Keep indoors. Go home.
Those who are far from home can take refuge in the underground railways.
Go home.
Go home. Go home.
Get out of the square. Get out of the streets.
Go home and keep home.
Put out your lights. Close the windows.
Put a wet sheet or a wet blanket over doors and windows.
Get indoors. Get indoors.
Get out of the streets.
Go home and keep home. Keep indoors.
Go home.
Go home.
Do not assemble in crowds.
My dear.
Are you sorry we had these children?
No.
Life must carry on.
Why should we surrender life to the brutes and fools?
I loved you.
I wanted to serve you and - and make life happy for you.
But think of the things that may happen to them.
Were we selfish?
You weren't afraid to bear them.
We were children yesterday.
We're anxious... but we're not afraid... really.
Courage, my dear.
And may that little heart have courage.
Are you an officer, Daddy?
Well, you've got to do your bit, you know, Sonny. You've got to do your bit.
I'm an officer too, Daddy.
That's the spirit.
Carry on, sir!
Carry on.
Good-bye, Son.
There.
Now then.
Quick march!
An air raid is approaching Everytown. An air raid is approaching Everytown.
Gas masks are being distributed.
See that they fit tightly behind the ears.
Get to cover. Get under cover at once.
The enemy are not in any great force... and our antiaircraft gunners will speedily dispose of them.
Bad shape, eh?
Why has it come to this?
God, why do we have to murder each other?
Go, my friend.
That is my gas, and it's a bad gas.
Funny if I'm - if I'm killed by my own poison.
Quick, get this on.
Here. Get this on, quickly.
Give it to her.
I've given plenty to others. Why should I not have some myself?
Give it to her!
I'm done.
That's it.
Breathe through your mouth.
I dropped the gas on her.
Maybe I've killed her father and mother.
Maybe I've killed her whole family.
And then I go and give up my mask to save her.
That's
That's funny.
That's a joke.
Look!
He's carrying the infection.
Iodine, please.
Mary, iodine.
There's no more left, Father. This is the last drop.
God.
What is the use of trying to save this mad world from these punishments?
Oh, Father, if only you could get some sleep.
How can I sleep?
See how they wander out to die?
Why don't you shoot them?
It's their lives or ours.
Let's get guards and make a cordon.
That's how they dealt with the pestilence in the Dark Ages.
Richard.
My sister.
Gordon, how do you know?
Her heart beats fast, and - and she feels faint.
And she won't answer.
What can I do for her?
I thought something might be known.
Poor Janet.
And you, you poor dear.
Richard.
I might be infected.
Is there nothing to make her comfortable?
Nothing.
There's nothing will make anyone comfortable anymore.
No!
Don't shoot.
Shoot, I tell you! Shoot.
That's the way to do it. Shoot 'em.
May Day, 1970.
The pestilence has ceased.
Thanks to the determined action of our chief in shooting all wanderers... there have been no cases for two months.
The pestilence has been conquered.
The chief is preparing to resume hostilities... against the hill people with the utmost vigor.
Soon we shall have victory and peace.
All is well.
God save the chief.
God save our land.
Have we any more insulated wire?
We've got no rubbered wire at all, sir.
Any rubber tape?
There's not a scrap left in the place. We used the last on the other motor.
Oh, what's the use!
There's no petrol anyway.
I don't believe there's three gallons of petrol left in this accursed ruin of a town.
What's the good of setting me at a job like this?
Nothing will ever fly again. Flying's over. Everything's over.
Civilization's dead.
Hello.
It's a Rolls, isn't it?
Yes. It's a good pre-pestilence machine.
I oil it and turn it over at times.
Do you think it'll go fast someday still?
Oh, I'm not one of your petrol hoarders.
But all the same, that engine turns over still.
Why, I remember when I was a lad, when it was new... we thought nothing of going a hundred miles in it.
A whole hundred miles.
Less than three hours I've done it in.
But that sort of thing's all gone now.
Gone forever, huh?
Afraid so.
Hyup!
Hyup.
Richard.
What is it?
You won't think me mad?
Why, darling?
I thought I heard an aeroplane this morning at dawn.
I thought it was a dream, but-
Nonsense. I tell you flying's finished.
We shall never get in the air again.
Never.
Hey. Come on. The boss.
Look!
The boss.
The boss is coming!
Here's to the boss!
Hey!
Anything to report, Gordon?
Nothing very hopeful, Chief.
I must have those aeroplanes somehow.
I'll do what I can, but you can't fly without petrol.
I'll get petrol for you, trust me. You look after the machines.
I know you haven't got the stuff, but you can get round that.
For example, transfer parts. Use bits of one to mend another.
Be resourceful.
Give me only 10 machines in working order. Give me only five.
I don't want them all. And we'll end this war of ours forever.
I'll see you get your reward.
This your wife, Gordon?
You keep her well hidden.
Salutation, lady.
You must use your influence with our master mechanic.
The combatant state wants his service.
I'm sure my husband does his best for you.
That's hardly enough, lady. The combatant state demands miracles.
Not everyone can work miracles as you do, Chief.
Oh, I'm sure you could work miracles if you tried, lady.
Rudolf!
Lady, lady, I showed it to you, but you said you didn't want it.
If Wadsky's been up to his tricks again, he'll have to answer for them.
But he's been keeping things back from me again.
Not only Wadsky keeps things back.
What do you think of our master mechanic here... that won't let me have those planes of mine to end this war of ours with the hill men.
Well, can't you make him?
I thought you could make everybody do everything.
Some things you can't do, madam. You can't fly without petrol.
You can't mend machines without tools or material.
We've gone back too far. Flying's become a lost skill in Everytown.
Are you really as stupid as that?
I'm as hopeless as that.
And now, Chief, what are you going to do about it?
He's going to let me have those machines, and I'm going to let him have coal- stuff to make oil.
It's a lost skill. It's a dream of the -
There it is!
You were right!
A plane once more!
Look!
There he is.
He's shutting off. He's coming down.
What's the meaning of this?
They've got aeroplanes before us?
And you told me we couldn't fly anymore.
While we've been fumbling, they've been active.
Here, some of you - you and you.
Find out who this is and what it means. There's only one man in it.
Hold him.
Somewhere they can still make new machines.
I didn't dream it was still possible.
Yes, but who is this man?
How does he dare come here?
Fetch him to the town hall.
Guard his machine and bring him to me there.
Come along, Mary. I must see that machine.
Who's in control of this part of the country?
The chief.
What we call the boss.
Good.
I want to see him.
He sent me to arrest you.
You can't do that.
But I'll come and see him.
Well, you're under arrest whether you'll admit it or not.
The country's in a state of war.
Well, come along. I know the way.
I remember this place well. I used to live over there for years.
Ever heard of a man named Passworthy?
No.
Harding?
Yes.
Look!
Here he comes now.
So you're Harding?
I seem to remember something about you.
You were a young man.
You're John Cabal.
I remember you.
I used to visit your house here... endless years ago, before the wars.
You're still flying?
Your hair is gray, but you look young enough.
How are things here?
Who's in control in this place?
Well, we have a chief, a warlord.
The usual thing.
I want to look up your warlord.
Where can we go and talk?
My laboratory is the best thing. It's just over here.
Right.
Here!
You can't go in there!
You're under arrest.
You gotta go with me to the chief.
All in good time.
I must see this gentleman first.
Well, you gotta go with me!
Orders are orders.
The boss first!
Where is this man?
Why isn't he brought here?
He's gone off with Dr. Harding.
He has to be brought here. I must deal with him.
Here, you can't go to him.
That's impossible. He must come to you.
Send another man for him. Send three men. He's got to be brought here.
So that's the sort of man your boss is?
Not an unusual type.
Everywhere we find these little semi-military upstarts robbing and fighting.
That's what endless warfare has led to - brigandage.
What else could happen?
But we, who are all that are left of the old engineers and mechanics... have pledged ourselves to salvage the world.
We have the airways - or what's left of them.
We have the seas. And we have ideas in common.
The brotherhood of efficiency... the freemasonry of science.
We're the last trustees of civilization when everything else has failed.
I've been waiting for this.
I'm yours to command.
Not mine.
Not mine.
No more bosses. Civilization's to command.
Tell him he'll have to come.
If he won't come on foot, well, we'll have to carry him.
I don't know what'll happen to me, sir, if you don't come.
Well, what do you want to see me about?
Who are you?
Do you know this country's at war?
At war?
Still at it, eh?
We must clean that up.
What do you mean we must clean that up?
War's war.
Who are you, I say?
The law.
Law and sanity.
I am the law here!
I said law and sanity.
Where do you come from?
Who are you?
Wings Over the World.
Well, you know, you can't come into a country like this in this fashion.
I'm here.
Do you mind if I sit down?
And now, for the fourth time, who are you?
I tell you, Wings Over the World.
That's nothing. What government are you under?
Common sense.
I belong to World Communications. We just run ourselves.
Eh?
You'll run into trouble if you try and land here in wartime.
What's the game?
Order and trade.
Trade, eh?
Can you do anything in munitions?
Not our line of business.
Tools?
Spare parts?
We've got planes. We've got planes.
I've got boys that have trained a bit on the ground.
We've no fuel. It hampers us. We might do a deal.
We might.
I know where I can get some fuel. I've got my plans later.
But if you can manage a temporary accommodation, we'd do business.
World Communications helps no one to make war.
End war. End war.
I want to make victorious peace.
I seem to have heard that phrase before... when I was a young man.
But it's made no end of war.
Now look here, Mr. Aviator.
Let's see how we stand.
Come down to actuality.
The way you swagger, you don't seem to realize you're under arrest.
You and your machine.
You'll find other planes looking for me if I happen to be delayed.
We'll deal with them later.
Now, you can start a trading agency here if you like.
I have no objection.
The first thing we shall want is to get our planes in the air again.
Quite a laudable ambition.
But our new order has an objection to private aeroplanes.
The impudence!
I'm not talking about private aeroplanes.
Our aeroplanes are public aeroplanes.
This is an independent sovereign state at war.
I know nothing about any old order.
I'm the chief here... and I'm not taking any orders, old or new, from you.
I suppose I've walked into trouble.
Yeah, you can take that as right.
Where do you come from?
I flew from our headquarters at Basra this morning.
We have some hundreds of new-type planes, and we're building more fast.
The factories are working again.
We're gradually restoring order and trade in the whole Mediterranean area.
We're scouting this region now to see how things are.
You've found out.
This is an independent sovereign state.
Yes, we must talk about that.
We don't discuss it.
We don't approve of independent sovereign states.
You don't approve?
We mean to stop them.
That's war.
If you will.
All right.
I think we know how we stand.
Burton, take this man.
If he gives you any trouble, club him.
Do you hear that, Mr. Wings Over Your Wits?
My friends know my whereabouts.
If I don't come back, they'll send a force to find me.
Perhaps they won't find you.
They'll find you.
They'll find me ready.
Take him to the detention room downstairs.
Now, was that wise?
Wise?
Yes, wise, to quarrel with at once.
Quarrel with him?
Confound him. He began the quarrel with me.
We must clean that up."
Clean that up!
My war.
There's things behind him.
Things behind him?
Some sort of aerial bus driver.
Standing up to me, like an equal.
So you lost your temper and you bullied him.
I don't bully. I just handled the man.
He's the first real aviator that has come this way for years.
Think of what that means, my dear.
You want aeroplanes, don't you?
You want your aeroplanes put in order?
A really clever man could have had some of those machines up long ago.
I'm sure of it.
Along comes this stranger who's going to clean me up... and you expect me to hand my planes over to him lock, stock and barrel.
Why talk nonsense?
You could have persuaded him, under supervision.
Supervision?
The sort of oafs I've got here to supervise him.
He'd be too much for them.
Oh, well, of course, if he's going to be too much for you, why don't you hang him... and hide his machine before the others are after you?
I don't agree with you.
I don't agree with you.
Now, this stranger hasn't taken me by surprise.
I knew he was coming.
Yes, I knew he was coming.
I felt this conspiracy of air bus drivers brewing somewhere in the world.
I felt they were getting ahead with their aeroplanes down there somewhere.
Very well. Now's our chance.
We've got this fellow bottled up. They won't even begin to miss him for days.
I've got everything fixed now for an attack straightaway... on the Floss Valley to the old coal and shale pits, where there's oil too.
Then up we buzz.
Victory approaches!
Your sacrifices have not been in vain.
Our old struggle with the hill men has come to its climax.
Our new victory at the coal pits... has brought a great supply of oil within our reach.
Once more, we may hope to take the air... look our invaders in the face.
We've 40 aeroplanes - as large a force, I venture to say, as any in the world.
This new oil can be adapted to our needs.
That's quite a simple business.
Nothing remains but the conclusive bombing of the hills.
Then for a time, we can hope for a rich, rewarding peace.
The peace of the strong man, armed, who keepeth his house.
And now, at this supreme crisis, you, Gordon, our master mechanic, refuse your help.
Where are my planes?
The job's more difficult than you think. Half your machines are hopelessly old.
You haven't 20 sound ones - to be exact, 19.
You'll never get the others off the ground.
The thing can't be done as you imagine it. I want assistance.
What assistance?
Your prisoner.
What, you want that chap in black, that Wings Over the World?
You want him released?
He knows his business.
I don't enough. Make him my technical adviser.
I don't trust you technical chaps.
Then you won't get an aeroplane up.
I want those planes.
Well, if you get him?
Then I want Dr. Harding out too.
They're old associates.
I can't help that.
If anybody in Everytown can adapt to that crude oil for our aeroplanes, it's Harding.
If not, it can't be done.
Oh, we've had a bit of an argument with Harding lately.
He's the only man who can do this work for you.
Get him.
Undo his hands.
Well?
Well what?
The salute.
Damn the salute!
Ah, never mind the salute now. We'll talk about that later.
Now look here. Let's see how we stand.
You, Gordon, are to undertake the reconstruction of our air force.
The prisoner, Cabal, is to be placed at your disposal.
Everywhere he goes, he's to be under guard and observation.
No relaxing on that.
Neither you nor he are to go within a hundred yards of his aeroplane.
Mind that.
Now you, Harding, are to assist Gordon with his fuel problem... and place your knowledge of poison gas at our disposal.
I'll have nothing to do with poison gas!
You've got the knowledge if I have to wring it out of you.
The state's your mother, your father, the totality of your interests!
No discipline can be too severe for the man that denies that by word or deed!
Nonsense!
We have a duty to civilization.
You and your sort are driving us straight back to eternal barbarism.
But this is pure treason!
I protest against being dragged away from my work!
Confound your silly war and your war material and all the rest of it.
All my life has been interrupted and wasted and spoilt by war.
I'll not stand it any longer!
But this is treason, treason!
No, no, no, no. Stop that.
We've need of your service.
Well, what do you want?
You're conscripted!
You're under my orders now and under no other orders in the world.
I'm master here. I'm the state.
I need fuel and gas!
Neither fuel nor gas.
You refuse?
Absolutely.
I don't want to be forced to extremities.
May I have a word?
I understand you want all of those out-of-date crocks of yours - which you call your air force - to fly again and fly well.
They shall!
With the help of that man, Cabal, you have in the cells... and Dr. Harding here... you may even have a dozen of your planes in the air again.
You!
You're a traitor to civilization.
I won't touch it!
If you will give me Cabal... and if you leave me free to talk with Harding...
I promise you you'll see your air force - a third of it, at any rate - in the sky again.
You talk as if you're driving a bargain with me.
I'm sorry, Chief.
It's not I who makes these conditions.
It is the nature of things.
You cannot have technical services, you cannot have scientific help... without treating the men who give it to you properly.
That's what I've said all along.
You're bullying too hard, my dear, and there's a limit to bullying.
Why?
You can't make a dog hunt by beating it.
I want those planes!
Chief and commanders, a health!
Our war leader, our peace maker - Rudolf the Victorious.
To Rudolf!
Speech!
Speech!
Speech!
Speech!
Come on! Speech!
My captains, my commanders, I greet you.
Could anything in life be better than this moment?
You've faced difficulties and dangers.
But now, at this bright moment of victory... we relax to gather strength for the supreme effort... that will make this land forever ours.
Hear!
Hear!
A man's land we're making - a land for strength and for courage.
None but the brave deserve the land.
None but the brave deserve the fair.
Our dear old world. Our dear old land.
There are some among us that dare to run down our land.
It isn't this.
It isn't that. It isn't what it used to be.
We haven't got chemists."
Well, who wants chemists?
We don't want 'em.
They don't print books anymore."
Who wants books to muddle their thoughts and their ideas?
We can't travel anymore."
Well, isn't our land good enough for us?
I wanted to look at you.
I am at your service, madam.
You're the most interesting thing that has happened in Everytown for years.
You honor me.
You come from... outside.
I'd begun to forget there was anything outside.
I want to hear about it.
May I offer you my only chair?
You know, I'm not a stupid woman.
I'm sure.
This life here is limited.
War - always going on and never-ending.
Flags. Marching.
Oh, I adore the chief.
I've always adored him since he took control in the pestilence days... when everyone else lost heart.
He rules. He's firm.
Everyone, every woman finds him strong and attractive.
I can't complain.
I have everything that is to be had here.
And yet - [Signs 1
This is a small, limited world we live in.
You bring in the breath of something greater.
When I saw you swooping down out of the air - when I saw you marching into the town hall-
I felt, "This man lives in a greater world."
You spoke of the Mediterranean and the East, of your camps and factories.
I've read about the Mediterranean and Egypt and Greece and India.
Oh, I can read - a lot of those old books.
I'm not like most of the younger people here.
I learned a lot before education stopped and schools closed down.
I want to see that world - skies, snowy mountains, blue seas, sunshine, palms.
If I had my way, you could fly to all that in a couple of hours.
If you were free... and if I was free.
I don't suppose any man has ever understood any woman... since the beginning of things.
You don't understand our imagination... how wild our imaginations can be.
I wish I were a man.
Oh!
If I were a man!
What are your people trying to do to us?
What are you going to do to this boss of mine?
The immediate question seems, what does he mean to do to me?
Something violent and foolish, unless I prevent it.
That's how I see things.
And if he kills you?
We shall come here and clean things up.
But if you're killed, how can you say We"?
We go on. That's how things are.
We are taking hold of things.
In science and government, in the long run, no man is indispensable.
The human things go on.
We - forever.
I see.
And this warlike state of ours here?
It has to vanish - like the tyrannosaurus and the saber-toothed tiger.
Ah!
So here you are.
I said I should talk to him, and I have.
I told you to leave that fellow alone.
Yes, and sat up there drinking and swaggering and looking as proud as you could.
Rudolf the Victorious.
And here am I trying to find out what this black invader means.
You think I wanted to come and talk to him - this gray, cold man?
While you're swaggering here... there are more planes away there at Basra getting ready.
Basra?
His headquarters.
Have you never heard of Basra?
These are matters for us to talk about.
This lady has been putting me through a severe cross-examination.
But the gist of it is that, away there in Basra... new aeroplanes are rising night and day, like hornets round a hornets' nest.
What happens to me is a small affair.
They'll finish you.
The new world of united airmen will finish you.
Listen.
You can almost hear them coming now.
Not a bit of it.
What he says is the truth.
What he says is bluff.
Make peace with the airmen and let him go.
That means surrender of our sovereign independence.
But more machines will be coming and more and more.
Yeah, and he's here, hostage for their good behavior.
Come, madam.
Enough of this little diplomatic mission of yours.
You've got the subtlety of a bullfrog.
Here, I don't know what she's been saying to you.
I don't much care.
But there's no making peace between you and me.
It's your world or mine, and it's going to be mine.
For all your threats of swarms of hornets and so on, you're a hostage.
Remember that.
And don't be too sure you'll win.
So just sit here and think that over, Mr. Wings Over the World.
Get round to the other side and look at these engine bearer braces.
Quickly.
If I could get to my plane, there's a wireless there.
It's hopeless.
They won't even trust me.
We shall have to make a job of this.
I can manage to get your reserve petrol.
They'll let me have that for this plane.
Good.
It won't be easy to make a getaway.
These oil pump connections aren't very good, but we'll have to risk it.
I think we'll manage it all right now that Harding knows his part of the job.
Good.
Look!
It's your Gordon. He's flying at last.
Look!
An aeroplane out of the ark, boys.
It's pre-war.
Where do you come from?
He comes from the north, sir, from Everytown.
He says Cabal is a prisoner there.
They've got him, sir, and he's in danger. I had great difficulty in getting here.
You say Cabal is in danger?
In very great danger.
The boss there is a violent tough.
Hmm. Job for our new squadron.
Well, now we've got a chance to try the new gas of peace on somebody.
There's no time to lose, sir. May I report to headquarters?
Yes.
Take him to the council.
At last, we have definite news.
What is it?
Gordon didn't fall into the sea. He got away.
A fishing boat saw him making for the French coast.
Perhaps he reached his pals.
Well?
Well, he'll be coming back. He'll be bringing the others with him.
Curse these World Communications.
Curse all airmen and gas men and machine men!
Why didn't we leave their machines and their sciences alone?
I might have known.
Why did I tamper with flying?
Well, we needed aeroplanes - against the hill state.
Somebody else would have started in again with aeroplanes and gas and bombs if we hadn't.
These people would have come interfering anyhow.
Why was all this science ever allowed?
Why was it ever let begin?
Science?
It's an enemy of everything that's natural in life.
I dreamt of those fellows last night- great ugly, black, inhuman chaps.
Half like machines.
Bombing and bombing.
Yes, I guess they'll come bombing, all right.
Then we'll fight 'em!
Since Gordon got away, I've had those air boys up to see me.
They've got guts. They'll do something still.
We'll fight 'em. We'll fight 'em.
Ha!
We've got hostages.
I'm glad I didn't shoot them anyway.
There's that chap Harding.
Of course!
He can tell us what to do against this gas... if I have to pull his arm off and knock his teeth down his throat.
Get him!
Get him!
Go get Dr. Harding.
They have to come to earth sometime.
What is this World Communications?
A handful of men like ourselves.
They're not magic.
To you, I entrust these good, tried, tested machines.
You are not mechanics. You are warriors.
You have been trained not to think, but to do... maybe to die.
I salute you, I, your chief!
What do you know about these World Communications people?
Have they gas?
What sort of gas?
I know nothing about gas.
Tell us about these masks anyway.
Oh, they're rotten. They're no good at all.
What sort of gas have they got?
I tell you, gas isn't my business.
They can't gas us when you're here anyway.
Here they are.
Listen.
They're coming already!
We're here. Tell them to stand by.
Clumsy great things!
Our boys will have them down in no time.
They're too clumsy.
What, only six of us up?
Where are the rest of our fellows?
Go on!
Up at him.
Poor boy!
It's got him!
They're both coming down.
Cowards!
But they can't use gas if we have hostages.
The hostages!
I'm not done yet. Go on. Fetch them.
Bring them out here out in the open. Tie 'em up where they can be seen.
Where's the other fellow? He's the prize hostage.
He's the best of the lot. They'll know him.
Fetch him.
Fetch him.
Look!
Is that gas?
Anyway, you won't get out of this.
You?
Don't you see?
We're beaten.
Shoot them!
What are you all doing?
Why don't you move?
I never did you any harm.
I saved your father, and I saved you.
Couldn't you call up to your man there to stop this?
I won't have it like this!
What's happening?
Everything's swimming.
Shoot!
Shoot!
We never shot enough yet!
We never shot enough.
We spared them. Now they've got us.
Our world or theirs.
Why should I be beaten like this?
Shoot!
Shoot!
Shoot!
Shoot!
There they are.
Mary!
No, no.
She's not hurt. She's asleep like the others.
Cabal's safe!
Cabal!
Well done, Gordon!
Well, they laughed at me for sticking to my gas mask.
But thanks to that, I'm here and everyone else is sleeping.
I wonder if they'll ever use gas masks again.
Sir!
What is it?
This man's not sleeping. He's dead.
Dead. And his world dead with him.
And a new world beginning.
Poor old Boss here and his flags and his follies.
And now for the rule of the airmen and a new life for mankind.
Our job is only beginning.
For now, we have to put the world in order.
It will be a long and complicated struggle... but we have the unity of a common order and a common knowledge.
This is how I conceive our plan of operations.
First a roundup of brigands - that last dismal vestige of ancient predatory soldiering... the last would-be conquerors.
Then settle, organize, advance.
This zone, then that.
And at last, Wings Over the World... and the new world begins.
Do you realize the immense task we shall undertake... when we set ourselves to an active and aggressive peace... when we direct our energies to tear out the wealth of this planet... and exploit all these giant possibilities of science... that have been squandered hitherto upon war and senseless competition?
We shall excavate the eternal hills.
We shall make such use of the treasures of sky and sea and earth... as men have never dreamt of hitherto.
I would that I could see our children's children... in this world we shall win for them.
But in them and through them, we shall live again.
Is it any better world than it used to be?
I rebel against this progress.
What has this progress, this world civilization, done for us?
Machines and marvels.
They've built these great cities of theirs, yes.
They've prolonged life, yes.
They've conquered nature, they say, and made a great white world.
Is it any jollier than the world used to be in the good old days... when life was short and hot and merry and the devil took the hindmost?
All the same, what can we do about it?
Rebel.
And rebel now.
Now. Now is the time.
Why now in particular?
Why, because of this space gun business... because of this project to shoot human beings at the stars.
People don't like it, shooting humans away into hard, frozen darkness.
They're murmuring.
They've murmured before, and nothing came of it.
Because they had no leader.
But now... suppose someone cried, "Halt!
Stop this progress!"
Suppose I shouted to the world, "Make an end to this progress!"
I could talk, talk. Radio is everywhere.
This modern world is full of voices.
I'm a master craftsman. I have the right to talk.
Yes, but will they listen to you?
They'll listen, trust them... if I shout, "Arise!
Awake!
Stop this progress before it is too late!"
I like these history lessons.
Mm-hmm.
What a funny place New York was, all sticking up and full of windows.
They built houses like that in the old days.
Why?
They had no light inside their cities as we have.
So they had to stick them up into the daylight, what there was of it.
They had no properly mixed and conditioned air.
Everybody lived half out of doors.
They had windows of brittle glass.
The age of windows lasted four centuries.
They never seemed to realize that we could light the interiors of our houses with sunshine of our own... so there was no need to stick them up ever so high into the air.
Weren't the people tired going up and down those stairs?
They were all tired, and they had a disease called colds.
Everybody had colds.
And they coughed and sneezed and ran at the eyes.
Sneezed.
What's "sneezed"?
Oh, you know.
Ah-tishoo!
Ah-tishoo?
Everybody said "ah-tishoo"?
That must have been funny.
Not so funny as you think.
And you remember all that, Great-grandfather?
Well, I remember some of it.
The colds we had... and indigestion, too, from the queer, bad foods we ate.
Oh, it was a poor life - never really well.
Did people laugh at it?
Well, they had a way of grinning at it.
They used to call it humor.
We had to have a lot of humor.
I've lived through some horrid times, my dear.
Oh, horrid.
Horrid?
I don't want to hear about that.
The wars, the wandering sickness... and all those dreadful years.
None of that will come again, Great-granddad, ever?
Well, not if progress goes on.
They keep on inventing new things now, don't they... and making life lovelier and lovelier?
Lovelier.
Yes.
And bolder.
I suppose I'm an old man, my dear, but some of it seems like going too far.
This space gun of theirs that they keep on shooting.
What is this space gun, Great-grandfather?
Well, it's a gun they discharge by electricity.
It's a lot of guns inside one another... and each one discharges the gun next inside.
I don't properly understand it... but the cylinder it shoots out last goes - swish - right away from the Earth.
I wish I could fly round the moon.
Well, that in time.
Won't you come back to your history pictures again?
I'm glad I didn't live in the old world.
I know that John Cabal and his airmen tidied it all up.
Did you see John Cabal, Great-granddad?
Well, you can see him in your pictures.
But you saw him when he lived. You really saw him?
Yes.
I saw the great John Cabal with my own eyes when I was a little boy.
He was a lean, brown old man with hair as white as mine.
He was the great-grandfather of our Oswald Cabal... the president of our council.
I take it the space gun's passed all its preliminary trials... and there's nothing left now but to choose the two who are to go.
That's going to be the trouble.
Thousands of young people have been applying - young men and young women.
I never dreamt the moon was so attractive.
Practically, the gun's perfect now.
There are risks, but reasonable risks.
And the position of the moon in the next three or four months... gives us the best conditions for getting there.
It's only the choice of the two now that matters.
Well?
There are going to be difficulties.
That man Theotocopulos is talking on the radio about it.
He's a fantastic fellow.
Yes, but he's making trouble.
It's not going to be easy to choose these young people.
With all these thousands offering themselves?
We've looked into thousands of cases.
We've rejected everyone of imperfect health... or anyone who had friends who objected.
And the fact is, we want you to talk to two people.
There's Raymond Passworthy of General Fabric. You know him?
Yes, I know him.
And his son.
We want you to see the son, Maurice Passworthy.
Why?
He asks to go.
We think you ought to see him. He's waiting here.
Is Maurice Passworthy there?
He's on his way.
Good.
You want to talk to me?
Forgive me, sir.
I came straight to you.
You're asking a favor?
A very big favor.
I want to be one of the first two human beings to go round the moon.
It means danger, great hardship anyhow.
You realize there's an even chance of never corning back alive... a still greater chance of coming back a cripple.
Give me credit for not minding that, sir.
Mm-hmm.
Yes, a lot of you young people don't mind that.
But why should I give you a favor?
Well, I'm
I'm the son of a friend of yours and -
Well, people seem to feel you oughtn't to send someone you don't know, sir.
Go on.
We've talked about this over and over again.
We?
Yes, both of us.
It's her idea even more than it's mine.
Her idea?
Who is she?
Someone much closer to you than I am, sir.
Go on.
It's Catherine, your daughter.
She says you can't possibly send anybody's child but your own.
I might have known.
Today, I'm going to put it to the world plainly.
Is this thing to go on... or are we sane and normal human beings to put an end to it... and an end to all such follies forever?
What is this progress?
What is the good of all this progress onward and onward?
We demand a halt. We demand a rest.
The object of life is happy living.
We will not have human lives sacrificed to experiment.
Progress is not living. It should only be the preparation for living.
They stage the old Greek tragedy again... and a father offers up his daughter to his evil gods.
That voice is sounding to the whole world.
I might suppress it.
No.
They'll have to hear him and make what they can of him.
What does this space gun portend?
Make no mistake about it.
The slaveries they put upon themselves today... they will impose tomorrow upon the whole world.
Is man never to rest... never to be free?
A time will come when you in your turn... will be forced away to take your chance upon strange planets... and in dreary, abominable places beyond the stars.
An end to progress.
Make an end to this progress now.
Let this be the last day of the scientific age.
Make the space gun the symbol of all that drives us and destroy it!
NOW!
I wonder what they will make of him.
It's all very well for you, Cabal.
You're the great-grandson of John Cabal, the air dictator... the man who changed the whole course of the world.
You've got experiment in your blood, you and your daughter.
But I'm
I'm more normal.
I don't believe my boy would have thought of it.
The two of them must have got together.
They'll come back together.
This time, there's no attempt to land on the moon.
When
When is this great experiment to be made?
How much longer have we got before they go?
When the space gun is ready.
Some time this year you mean?
Soon.
Then is there no way of saving our children from this madness?
But would it be saving our children?
Well, here they are.
Father, we're to go?
Yes, you're to go.
It's announced?
Two hours ago.
Already?
Why not?
But... my son.
He's of age.
He's volunteered.
Yes, but I want to talk it over first.
I must talk it over. Why have you announced this so soon?
There is still time to talk it over, isn't there?
Not so very long now, Father.
We're got several months yet surely.
It's just one month and three days. Everything's ready.
And the moon's coming into the right position even while we're talking now.
They're leaving it a month longer to make sure.
You mean you're going in four weeks?
Four weeks?
I forbid it!
This man Theotocopulos is right. This thing must not be.
It's human sacrifice!
Your speech has struck fire.
All the people are excited and angry.
Some of them are already going out of the city towards the space gun.
Nothing is wanted now but leading!
We must go right on with this.
To the space gun!
And so we end an age.
Young people just beginning life... and you want to go into that outer horror.
Why don't you send somebody who's sick of life?
They want fit young people - alert and quick.
And we're fit young people.
We can observe and come back and tell.
Cabal, I just want to ask you one plain question.
Why did you let your daughter dream of going on this mad moon journey?
Because I love her, and I want her to live to the best effect.
Dragging out life to the last possible second is not living to the best effect.
The nearer the bone, the sweeter the meat.
The best of life, Passworthy, lies nearest to the edge of death.
I'm a broken man.
I don't know where honor lies.
You haven't got things right, Passworthy.
Our fathers and our fathers' fathers cleaned up the old order of things... because it killed children.
It killed those who were unprepared for death.
Because it tormented people in vain.
Because it outraged human pride and dignity.
Because it was an ugly spectacle of waste.
But that was only a beginning.
There's nothing wrong in suffering if you suffer for a purpose.
Our revolution didn't abolish danger or death.
It simply made danger and death worthwhile.
Cabal!
Cabal, the gun's in urgent danger. It's a race against time now to save it.
Theotocopulos is out with a crowd of people already.
He's going to the space gun now.
They're gonna break it up.
They say it's the symbol of your tyranny.
Have they weapons?
Bars of metal.
They can smash delicate apparatus. They can do endless mischief.
But you have a traffic control. Can't they produce the police?
Very few.
We've nothing but the gas of peace, and it isn't ready.
It'll take hours yet.
We must hold this crowd back at any cost for a time until the gas of peace is ready.
Listen.
Look!
Cabal, they're rioting!
It's barbarism come back.
Who are you? - William Jeans
Astronomical Department, Space Gun.
We've stopped the airways. They'll have to go afoot.
And they'll take an hour or more to get there, even those who've already started.
That gun mustn't be broken up after all the final experiments have been made!
When everything was ready!
When everything was ready?
If they smash up that infernal gun, then honor is satisfied and you needn't go.
They won't smash the gun.
Suppose the gun was fired now?
Would the cylinder reach the moon?
It would miss and fly into outer space.
It's 5:00 now.
If the gun were fired before 7:00 -
And it could be?
Yes.
Then -
We go now. - No, no, no!
I don't know what to say, but don't go.
Don't go.
But, Father, we must go now, or we may never go.
Then for the rest of our lives, we'll feel we've shirked and lived in vain.
We must go now.
Quickly.
This way.
If you go up to the platform, we'll guard this below.
Right.
Contract all your muscles when the concussion comes.
In five minutes, you'll be able to get loose and move about.
There's the man!
There's the man who would offer up his daughter to the devil of science.
What do you want here?
We want to save these young people from your experiments.
We want to put an end to this inhuman foolery.
We mean to destroy that gun!
We have a right to do what we like with our lives - with our sort of lives.
We don't grudge you your artistic life.
You have safety, plenty - all you want.
We want to make the world safe for men.
No one prevents you.
How can we do that when your science and inventions... are perpetually changing life for us... when you're everlastingly contriving strange things... when you make what we think great seem small... when you make what we think strong seem feeble?
We don't want you in the same world with us.
We don't want this expedition.
We don't want mankind to go out to the moon and to the planets.
We shall hate you more if you succeed than if you fail.
Destroy the gun!
Before you can even reach the base of the gun, it will be fired.
Beware of the concussion.
Stand by, Control Room.
Clear all outside observers.
Stand by to fire.
There!
There they go.
That faint gleam of light.
I feel that what we've done is monstrous.
What they've done is magnificent.
Will they come back?
Yes, and go again and again - until the landing is made and the moon is conquered.
This is only a beginning.
And if they don't come back - my son and your daughter - what of that, Cabal?
Then presently others will go.
Oh, God!
Ls there never to be any age of happiness?
Is there never to be any rest?
Rest enough for the individual man.
Too much and too soon, and we call it death.
But for man, no rest and no ending.
He must go on, conquest beyond conquest.
First this little planet and its winds and waves... and then all the laws of mind and matter that restrain him.
Then the planets about him... and, at last, out across immensity to the stars.
And when he has conquered all the deeps of space... and all the mysteries of time... still he will be beginning.
But we're such little creatures.
Poor humanity - so fragile, so weak.
Little
Little animals.
Little animals.
And if we're no more than animals, we must snatch each little scrap of happiness... and live and suffer and pass... mattering no more than all the other animals do or have done.
It is this... or that.
All the universe or nothingness.
Which shall it be, Passworthy?
Which shall it be?
Are you going to Epernay?
When?
In a half hour.
By lorry? Then give me a lift.
Right. Josephine?
Yup!
You've no monopoly!
Who cares!
Maréchal, you've got to take up a staff officer.
He's picked a rotten time.
Josephine again?
Yup!
Where will that get you?
She'll have to wait, that's all.
Alcohol kills! Alcohol drives you mad!
The squadron leader drinks it!
This is Captain de Boeldieu of Divisional Command.
Have you seen this photo, Mr Maréchal?
Ricord and I took it.
And where is this... Mr Ricord?
On leave.
Of course.
That little grey spot worries me...
There, below the road.
That's a canal, not a road.
No, a railway.
Such unanimity is a tribute to our photography.
It was misty.
Still, I'd like to clear up the mystery.
I'll order a plane.
I'll go and get ready, Sir.
Flying suit or jacket?
I don't mind, one smells, the other moults.
The fighter squadron, please.
Drive fast to the sugar refinery.
I shot down a French plane.
If the crew are officers, invite them here for lunch.
Make us one of your famous fruit punches.
To celebrate my shooting down my second plane.
No careless talk! The enemy is listening
Two officers, one wounded, so I took him to the first-aid post.
Captain von Rauffenstein, 21 Squadron.
Captain de Boeldieu, Staff HQ. - Pleased to meet you.
Lieutenant Maréchal, pilot.
Sorry about your arm.
My officers.
I am honored to have French guests.
Now, gentlemen, let us dine.
I knew a Boeldieu in Berlin,
Count de Boeldieu.
My cousin, Edmond de Boeldieu.
He was Military Attaché.
He is a pilot now...
Not hungry?
I can't cut up the meat.
May I?
Thank you.
You speak good French.
I worked as an engineer in Lyons.
Really!
I'm in eng... engineering...
To Captain de Crussol, French Air Force, shot down in flames
From the German officers of 21 Squadron
I regret this coincidence.
May the earth lie gently on our gallant enemy.
I have come for the prisoners.
PRISONER-OF-WAR CAMP NÂ° 17 OFFICERS CAMP
Officers will be treated with the consideration due to their rank.
However, you are reminded that you are under German military law.
You will therefore submit to German discipline.
Every German soldier in the camp may give you orders.
And you will obey without protest.
You will salute German officers.
At any attempt at escape, sentries have orders to fire on officers outside the camp boundary.
Incorrect dress is not permitted.
Strictly forbidden!
It is forbidden to form groups or insult the German nation... to write or speak to civilians...
Strictly forbidden!
It is forbidden to speak to sentries.
Come with us to attend to some formalities.
Russian names decline, like in Latin.
Newcomers.
Better warn them.
Pure angel, radiant angel
Hide your gold!
Go on! Get into your rooms!
What did they say?
To hide our valuables.
Leave it alone, it's mine.
I've nothing on me.
I'd no idea I was coming. Sorry.
Where are your manners?
Sorry, it's our duty, this is war.
Agreed, but even so let's remember our manners.
Otherwise I shall consult the Commanding Officer.
Open it.
How are you doing, pal?
Not bad at all, eh?
Here, Muller. You'll take some chocolate, won't you?
You've no right to open my ham!
It's regulations!
It's bad! You can have it!
He's too finicky!
I'm delighted each time my parents send me a parcel.
Here we are, in the heart of Germany, miles behind the front...
And a tin of peas arrives from Paris.
All right, then?
Fine.
What astonishes me is their honesty in handing over the parcels.
It's a fact.
Feldwebel Arthur stuffs himself with cabbage every day.
Gives him chronic indigestion.
He'd much rather tuck in to your peas.
Don't kid yourselves.
They wouldn't risk the parcels stopping.
They're hard put to feed themselves.
Hurry up, our guests will be hungry.
Same old thing! Old boots again!
What are the French eating?
Cabbages, but they've their parcels.
Russians?
Cabbage roots, but no parcels.
The English?
Plum pudding.
In peace-time I was an actor... in the Halls.
Ever see me?
The theatre's too serious for me.
I prefer cycle racing.
You ever follow it?
You must have heard of the champions.
Can we buy what we like?
Yes, through the canteen.
Fine, I shall buy an armchair... playing cards, books, English cigarettes...
You won't find those!
I'll try and come tomorrow, Sir.
Gentlemen, dinner is served.
What shall we begin with?
Cold chicken, pÃ¢té de foie... mackerel in wine?
Quite a menu!
Don't they feed us?
They do in theory, in fact it's uneatable.
Fortunately there are our parcels, especially Rosenthal's.
Please...
A drop of cognac as an aperitif?
Why not?
I've never eaten so well in my life!
Some fish?
Yes, please.
I'm starting to take Rosenthal's kindness for granted.
It shows man is a creature of habit.
No need to tell you he's a teacher.
Teach... preach...
Screech... leech...
Bloody hell!
Quite a joker!
Are we supposed to find that witty?
He's particular!
This calls for a drink!
Good cognac.
From Fouquet's, disguised as a mouthwash.
Fouquet's?
It's a bar on the Champs-Elysées.
In Paris, I ate at my brother-in-law's.
It's less expensive.
Been in Paris lately?
A week ago.
Lucky chap! Many people there?
Maxim's was crowded.
I never go to places like that...
I prefer a quiet spot... with good wine.
Maxim's... never been there.
You're not missing much.
We know you eat at your brother-in-law's.
Hey!
What is it?
Is he there... the monocle?
I've just come from the canteen. About his armchair...
Nothing doing.
I'll tell him.
Nice chap, the one with the parcels. Well-off, too.
You bet! - You know the Rosenthal bankers?
That's his family.
Am I tickling?
What's he do?
He's a dress designer.
Funny idea. If I'd all that money...
What did you do in civvy street?
Engineer, Ordnance Survey.
Between ourselves... Can your pal, the Captain, be trusted?
He may seem odd, but he's a decent chap.
You can trust him all right.
Fine, then.
Why?
You see... we're digging a tunnel.
What for?
To escape.
What do you dig with?
With a coal shovel, old cans...
We should come up in a garden... behind those buildings...
Slow work.
We've been at it for two months. We only need a few more weeks.
The war'll be over first!
That's an illusion.
Think so?
Best to be prepared.
Where's the tunnel?
You'll see tonight, after roll-call.
So you're digging a hole... like Monte Cristo, what a laugh!
Thanks for your help.
Well, you can't do it with your arm.
I'd like to ask you something.
What's the Ordnance Survey?
Maréchal!
Present!
Boeldieu!
Captain de Boeldieu, please.
Present!
I want my present!
Whose turn is it?
Cartier.
Mine!
What's that?
It's to help breathe, needs lengthening.
And those bags?
They're to collect the earth.
And this?
This is the alarm.
If I'm suffocating... I pull the string...
The tin falls... the others pull me out by the legs.
What are you waiting for?
Now for my mole act!
A mole in a hole!
Is the tunnel safe?
It's shored up with wooden props.
And the earth?
We've been stuffing it under the floor, but there's no more room.
So we fill bags and empty them outside.
Hear that?
I'm sure I heard something.
Nothing.
And again...
We'll send someone out to reconnoitre.
You slip out and take a look around.
I'll pretend to go to the lavatory.
What happened, Mr Arthur?
He tried to escape.
He was caught in the gardens behind those buildings... and shot.
Out there?
Is he dead?
I think so.
Anyway, what are you doing out?
Going to the lavatory.
What was it?
Someone tried to escape.
He got as far as the gardens behind the buildings.
A sentry shot at him.
He's dead.
Look, the alarm...
No answer.
Let's pull him out.
Are you hurt?
Drink some cognac.
From Fouquet's.
Cheers... don't take it away!
Whose turn is it tomorrow?
Yours, Sir... if you don't mind.
With pleasure, I need some exercise.
It is strictly forbidden to appear in anything except military uniform...
Dismissed.
Good news?
My aunt writes from Bordeaux that they're crowded out.
What do you think?
They'd better watch out, it says here there's a big Boche push.
There haven't been any celebrations so it can't mean much.
Coming gardening?
If you like.
German bulletins are so exaggerated.
So are ours.
Remember the Russian steam-roller?
Don't you think it's time we got down to... serious work?
But not all together.
Give me your tools.
And General Winter, who'd kill off the wicked Boche but act as a tonic for the Allies.
And "turpinite", remember "turpinite"?
A container as big as a... a radish... could blow up an army.
Why, they'd tried it on flocks of sheep.
Pity they didn't stop at that!
What've you planted here?
Dandelions.
I dream of dandelion salad.
The war'll be over before your dandelions sprout.
Don't be so sure.
This curious exercise will give us laborerâ€™s hands.
The hampers have come!
The costumes?
They're at the theatre.
One is full of women's clothes!
Coming, Sir?
No, I've no talent for theatricals. Besides, I'm busy.
A game of patience?
Exactly. I'm a realist.
Well, Arthur, found anything?
Nothing...
Well, gentlemen, enjoy yourselves.
Easy does it!
Where will we put all this?
I don't know. I asked for hangers too.
There must be some... Here!
Careful!
These things must be handled gently... with closed eyes!
Real dresses.
Looks like a child's dress.
Women's skirts are short now.
Just below the knee.
So I heard, I wish I could see them!
Put it on!
Not him, he's badly shaven.
You, angel-face.
If it amuses you...
Here, take this.
We'll have to do a full inventory.
There's this too.
And the corset!
Careful!
They wear their hair short too.
Short hair!
Must seem like sleeping with a boy!
When the cat's away the mice will play!
I'm sure my wife hasn't cut her hair...
That's just for the bits of fluff.
How would you know, with that mug?
Shoes!
I'd forgotten they were so small.
Stockings!
Silk stockings!
I'm ready, boys.
Don't disturb our dreams yet.
If we see you, it'll ruin our illusions.
They're beautiful.
Black stockings!
A real girl!
Funny, isn't it?
Don't you think it looks funny?
It really does look funny.
Poor lads.
Enjoy yourselves.
On one side, children play at soldiers...
On the other, soldiers play like children.
I wish I knew what's going on at my home.
No news?
Nothing.
I don't care what my old woman's doing.
I want to clear out from sheer boredom.
You want to escape for the fun of it.
In my case, it's contrariness.
Now that I may not fight, I long to.
I just follow the crowd. I'd rather do my bit with the rest.
I see no problem.
A golf course is for golf... A tennis court for tennis...
A prison camp for escape.
What do you say, as a sportsman?
Him!
He was born in Jerusalem!
Wrong, Vienna! My mother was Danish, my father Polish, naturalized French.
Good old French aristocracy!
And yet for all your old French stock, not one of you owns an acre of France.
In 35 years, the Rosenthals have acquired... three historic castles and all that goes with them:
hunting, farmland and horses.
And 3 galleries of genuine ancestors.
Believe me, it's worth escaping to fight for that.
I had never considered patriotism from that rather special point of view.
Your staff must feed like fighting cocks.
I got into it in a funny way.
I became a soldier because I'm a vegetarian.
That's right. My brother and I had weak stomachs...
The doctor warned us off meat.
I turned vegetarian and was cured...
My brother went on eating meat...
He fell ill and was invalided out.
Your decorations show vegetarianism didn't interfere with duty.
It didn't stop my wife sleeping around either.
You must admit it's stirring.
I can't stand fifes.
Whatever you say, it gets you.
It isn't the music that gets you...
It's the marching feet.
With all this yapping, my trousers are ruined!
FORT DOUAUMONT HAS FALLEN!
Do we put on the show just the same?
Rather! We certainly do!
In fact we should invite the German officers.
Although I don't share your artistic interests, Maréchal...
I congratulate you... Good show!
Do you know Marguerite?
She's not big and she's not small
With arousing eyes And a mouth like a child's
When I told this beauty That I loved her
She gave me flowers And called me a joker
I said, "Thanks for the flowers But that's not what I want
If you want to make me happy Marguerite
If you want to make me happy
Marguerite, give me your heart!"
That same evening by the window
I sang to make her appear
I'm sad because your pretty eyes Have set my heart alight!"
She, out of sheer kindness To put out my flame
Threw a bucket of water over me And said, "Happy now?"
I said, "Thanks for the bucket But that's not what I want
If you want to make me happy Marguerite
If you want to make me happy
Marguerite, give me your heart!"
All together now!
And now... to Paris!
Get it, Arthur?
Stop it!
We've retaken Douaumont! They announce it themselves!
What's the idea?
A little hole, to escape by.
Open this door!
Let me go! Leave me alone!
DOUAUMONT RE-OCCUPIED BY GERMAN TROOPS
Did you see? It's terrible.
Can't be much left of it!
Why, what's wrong? Not hungry today?
Leave me alone! I can't take it any longer! I'm fed up!
I want to see daylight!
It stinks in here!
You hear, it stinks!
And I want to hear a friendly voice...
I want to hear French spoken...
I want to hear French spoken, do you hear?
Why was he shouting?
The war's lasting too long...
If my calculations are right... in four days, we'll be beyond the garden wall.
It means plenty of bags of earth!
Now we've a chance of escaping and reaching home again I'm afraid of what I'll find.
There's more than one woman on earth!
Not for me.
That's why she sleeps around.
One thing upsets me, leaving Maréchal behind.
I dislike it too.
In fact... it irks me.
Sentiment has no place in war.
Good to see you, old man.
Same here. I'll tell you why in a minute.
Tell me, old man...
Is there anything to eat?
I'm hungry...
Sit down. Rosenthal's making some food.
What's the time?
Eleven o'clock.
How time drags today!
Never mind, tonight it's goodbye.
See you in Amsterdam.
I'm looking forward to the tulips in Holland.
What about the cheese?
Don't you like Dutch cheese?
Yes, but apparently the tulip fields stretch for miles and miles.
You're as romantic as a girl.
General roll-call at three.
All officers are to change camp.
Get your things ready.
A pleasant journey, gentlemen...
And I hope you will soon see your wives again.
Perhaps we should warn them.
About what?
The hole.
About the tunnel.
Careful.
We dug a tunnel in room 7, Sir.
A tunnel for escaping.
You not speak French. Hole dug. To escape.
Get back in line!
OFFICERS PRISON CAMP NÂ° 2
OFFICERS PRISON CAMP NÂ° 9
OFFICERS PRISON CAMP NÂ° 14
Open the window, it stinks in here.
I'm afraid there are only two pairs of white gloves left, Sir.
And we can't get any more, so try and make them last.
Yes, Sir... Some more coffee, Sir?
If you call that muck coffee, it's all right with me.
At least it will warm me up.
The list of new prisoners, Sir.
The new prisoners are here.
Three new prisoner-of-war officers reporting, Sir!
Hello, gentlemen.
Delighted to see you again, Boeldieu...
But sorry it should be here.
We too...
Sit down, gentlemen.
No, thank you, Sir.
At ease.
Captain de Boeldieu.
Four attempts at escape...
Via the boiler-room, a refuse pit...
Through the sewers, in a laundry basket.
Humility is sometimes a necessity...
I understand.
Lieutenant Maréchal, five attempts at escape.
Disguised as a sweep...
Pardon, Sir, hot-air expert.
Disguised as a German soldier, disguised as a woman.
Very funny, very funny indeed...
Not so funny when an N.C.O. took me for a woman, not to my taste at all!
Really?
Honestly!
Lieutenant Demolder, three attempts...
Gentlemen, I respect your patriotism and courage.
But here the situation is completely different.
No one can escape from this fortress.
You understand me, don't you?
So there can be no accusations of German barbarism,
I decided to apply French regulations.
Read it.
It makes good night-time reading.
And now, gentlemen, if you will follow me...
Oswald, my coat!
My men are not young, but they enjoy playing soldiers.
We have 25 like that.
I suppose you know the Maxim's gun?
Very well, Sir.
I prefer the restaurant.
Is that a dig at me?
Twelfth century.
Excuse me, Sir, but... was this villa built specially for Captain de Boeldieu and myself?
Sorry?
Are we your only guests?
No.
Your comrades are behind there.
Thirteenth...
A drop of 120 feet.
Very kind of you to show us round your place.
A very handsome castle...
So old...
And so cheerful...
So sorry I can't give you a room to yourself.
Thank you, but I would not have accepted in any case.
I trust the walk did not tire you.
Not at all, Sir, we're fine.
Fourteenth...
It's pure Gothic.
Excuse me. We have to search you.
Your friend Lieutenant Rosenthal from Heilbard Camp is here.
Good old Rosenthal!
We've the same bad luck!
You are to share the same room.
That way you will have better food.
That's nice. Really nice.
A mere formality.
I'll tell the Commander anyway. Look at that!
In my case, it was a brunette.
Who can you trust?
A friend of my mother's. She did a lot for charity.
Bad luck, it's not a very common disease in high society.
Eh, Boeldieu?
Yes... but it's a vanishing privilege.
Like so much else, it's become popularized.
Cancer and gout are not working-class diseases, but... they will be, believe me.
How about intellectuals?
In our case, it's tuberculosis.
Here's Mr Pindar!
And the middle-class?
Liver ulcers... they eat too much.
We'd each die of our own class ailment, if war didn't make all germs equal.
Your dictionaries are in my way.
Forgive me, but Pindar has always been so badly translated...
A sad oversight. I am broken-hearted.
Not that I care but who is Pindar?
But he means more to me than your life, the war, or my own life!
Pindar is the greatest Greek poet.
The greatest Greek poet?
Well, I'm blowed...
There! My map's as near as dammit complete.
See... this is where we are.
16 miles above this bend of the Main.
To enter Switzerland above Lake Constance and bypass the Rhine, we'll have to cover...
200 miles.
No kidding?
Reckon 15 nights forced march, on 6 lumps of sugar and 2 biscuits a day.
You're as crazy as he is with his Pindar!
To get out of this place...
There! My picture's finished.
Justice Pursues Crime...
Not bad is it?
Look here, to get to Lake Constance...
Will it hold?
It'll take 10 of you and 5 like me!
They're searching the rooms.
Under the mattress, quick!
No, under mine!
That's no good!
Too obvious.
May I?
What a brainwave!
A very handy little gutter.
Here they are!
Gentlemen, room inspection!
Louise wrote to Victor:
I am as weary as a girl after twenty-two nights of love..."
Twenty-two nights of love, imagine it!
Continue!
This part won't be searched!
Give me your word that there is nothing in here against regulations.
You have my word.
But why mine rather than the others?
The word of a...
Rosenthal?
Or a Maréchal?
Their word is as good as ours.
Maybe.
No, not that book!
It's very rare.
Poor old Pindar!
They're so ignorant...
Did it go all right for you here?
Not bad.
For us too.
And how's your cousin, Edmond de Boeldieu, who was Military Attaché in Berlin?
He is well and happy.
He lost an arm and married a very rich wife.
A fine career!
Remember her?
Sit down.
I'll tell you something...
Believe me... my present job disgusts me as much as you.
Strong words.
I used to be a fighter...
Now I am a civil servant... a policeman.
But it's the only way in which I can still... appear to be serving my country.
Burns everywhere. That is why I wear gloves.
Spine fractured in two places.
A silver plate.
My knee-cap is silver too.
This wealth I owe to the fortunes of war.
May I ask a question?
Of course.
Why did you make... an exception for me... inviting me here?
You are a de Boeldieu, a regular officer of the French Army.
And I a Rauffenstein, a regular officer of the Imperial German Army.
But... my friends are officers too.
A Maréchal and a Rosenthal, officers?
Good soldiers...
Thanks to your French Revolution!
I fear neither you nor I can arrest the march of time.
I don't know who will win this war...
The end, whatever it may be, will mean the end of the Rauffensteins and the Boeldieux.
We may be superfluous.
And don't you find it a pity?
Perhaps...
I admire your care of your geranium.
Not because I have turned botanist.
But it is the castle's only flower.
The only things that thrive here are ivy and nettles.
I'm glad I'm leaving with you.
With us.
Mind you, I like Boeldieu, but...
When I'm with him...
I never feel completely at ease...
Education, I suppose, but there's a barrier between us.
He's a fine type.
Agreed, and he's very decent, but...
Suppose you and I were broke, we'd both be beggars...
If it happened to him, he'd still be Monsieur de Boeldieu.
Anyway, haven't you been decent, feeding us with your parcels?
That's vanity...
I'm really proud of my rich family, and I invite you in order to show off.
Our great fault is said to be greed, we're often generous... unluckily, to balance this quality,
Jehovah gave us an overdose of pride.
I don't give a hang for Jehovah!
All I know is you're a good pal.
Comrades! Gentlemen!
We've received a large hamper, from the Empress.
Please come and share in it.
From the Empress?
It must be caviar.
Come on, they've got some vodka!
Vodka?
With pleasure.
We shall be able to return your many kindnesses.
The Empress is a generous lady.
A swell gal!
Let the fun begin!
Books.
Principles of Algebra, Elementary Ethics, Grammar...
A cookery book!
Something to get your teeth into!
Quite unbelievable!
Come on, there's going to be trouble.
Goodbye and thanks anyway.
The Cossacks are in a tizzy!
It's hotting up now!
You have no right to burn books!
The guards are busy with the Russians.
It's high here, but no one around.
What a chance if we'd been ready!
Growing dark too!
We'll just have to do it again.
Very kind of them to rehearse us!
Now we know if one man causes a stir and keeps it up for 5 minutes, his friends could escape.
Too risky!
Don't let's exaggerate.
I should enjoy it.
When do you want to start?
Why us?
You're in it too.
No, Maréchal.
Why not? Don't you trust us?
That wouldn't stop me.
Well then?
A plan like yours can only succeed with two...
And you get on well together...
It's unfair.
What's fair in war?
We can't accept.
I'm not asking advice,
I've made my decision.
The Arts aren't forbidden here...
You like music?
So-so...
I like a good waltz.
I adore the flute...
Here's the program... We'll buy flutes for everyone.
Each room will give a concert at 5p.m...
It grows dark then.
Five minutes later the flutes will be confiscated.
At 5.15, new concert with everything available.
Saucepans, animal cries, grinding of teeth, anything...
Result: roll-call in the courtyard.
Then?
That's my affair.
You'll have five minutes... to clear the walls and reach the woods.
Listen...
I don't know how to put it, but...
I feel awfully bad about it.
Come now...
I'd like to say something...
Rinse my gloves with some warm water, will you...
Whatever happens, I want you to know that...
But... I'm not doing it for you personally.
So no need to become sentimental.
Go on.
But there are times...
Let's avoid them, shall we?
Excuse me.
So you'll be wearing those?
Any objections?
No, but the idea of wearing white gloves wouldn't occur to me.
We all react differently.
You can't do anything like other people!
We've been together eighteen months, and you still stand on ceremony.
I am the same with my mother and my wife.
Well...
Cigarette?
No thanks, English tobacco gives me a sore-throat.
It's quite obvious!
Gloves, tobacco...
We've nothing in common.
We've got things in hand here...
Of course, the old man is quite mad with his organ and flower-pot!
A good thing I'm here to control that gang of lunatics...
Before the war, I was a schoolmaster.
Lieutenant, confiscate those damn flutes at once!
I advise you not to start again!
We'll do just that in 15 minutes.
Your orders have been carried out, Sir.
You see, all's well.
And now, three days on bread and water and no mail!
Get ready, men.
Two seconds...
General roll-call!
I've never had so much fun.
Long may it last.
Well...
What?
Goodbye.
Boeldieu!
Listen!
I beg you, come back!
Lieutenants Maréchal and Rosenthal have escaped!
So that was why.
Switch on the searchlights!
Send out patrols with dogs!
Alert all military and civil authorities.
Report to me every quarter of an hour.
Your orders have been carried out, Sir.
No trace of the fugitives yet.
Thank you.
Forgive me...
I would have done the same.
French or German... duty is duty.
Are you in pain?
I didn't think a stomach wound hurt so.
I aimed at your leg.
The visibility was bad...
Besides... I was running.
Please don't excuse me...
I bungled it.
Of us two, I am not most to be pitied.
For me it will all be over... soon...
But you have to carry on.
Carry on a futile existence...
To be killed in a war is a tragedy for a commoner.
For you... and me... it's a good way out.
I missed my chance...
Don't try to talk too much.
We shouldn't stay so near the road!
The reeds were too wet to sleep in.
He's gone.
It was a woman!
Come on.
Wait till dark.
I'm frozen, I must move about.
Do you want your sugar?
There's not much left.
And we've a long way to go.
What about you?
I had mine before, I was hungry.
You keep it, so I won't be tempted.
Poor chap...
Did you eat your buttons?
Does it show?
Aren't we going to wait till dark?
No, we'll just skirt the village.
Foot hurting?
It's nothing... a nerve.
Well, are you coming?
Are you coming or aren't you?
I'm doing my best.
You and your foot!
Not my fault!
I slipped!
You slipped! I'm sick of hearing it!
Is that what you'll say if we're caught?
Clumsy oaf! We've no food, may as well give ourselves up.
Willingly, I'm fed up too!
With me?
Yes, fed up! If you knew how I hate you!
I promise you it's mutual.
You're a dead weight round my neck!
Anyway I never could stick Jews!
A bit late to notice it!
Clear off, you're dying to.
Needn't say it twice!
Clear off! I'm sick of your ugly mug!
I will!
You can manage on your own!
I hope I never see you again!
I feel like singing at the thought!
There was a little boat
That had never gone to sea That had never gone to sea
After five or six weeks
The food started to get scarce...
Why have you come back?
Come on.
Come on, pal.
Had enough?
It's okay...
We'll rest in that shed.
Too risky.
I can't see any smoke.
Even so...
If your ship's on fire, you jump overboard.
Right, over we go!
Come on, then.
Someone's here.
Get out of the window, you can run.
I'll give you time.
Shut up and be quiet.
Don't move!
What are you up to?
We're Frenchmen... French, you understand?
We're not thieves.
Prisoners-of-war?
Do you speak German?
I've hurt my foot. We're done in. We're not thieves.
I'm not afraid.
Call the police, I won't walk another step!
You've hurt your foot?
She says to go to the house.
No, I don't trust her.
She says she's alone at home.
Come in.
She says, don't make a noise, her child's asleep.
I'll be back in a moment.
Hungry?
Oh, yes.
She asks if you're hungry.
I know that.
What about you?
I only want to sleep.
Sorry to disturb you! How far is Wolfischeim?
8 miles.
I'd sooner stay with you than footslog there!
But duty's duty. Thanks and goodnight.
Sit down.
Hush, my child's sleeping!
My husband.
Killed at Verdun.
My husband and brothers...
LiÃ¨ge, Charleroi, Tannenberg...
Our greatest victories!
The table's grown too big.
Keep calm, it's only me!
You don't mind if a Frenchman gives you your grub!
You smell good, like my grandfather's cows.
You're from Wurtemburg, I'm from Paris, but we can still be matey!
You're a poor cow, I'm a poor soldier.
We each do our best.
Clever girl!
We know everything, Mummy and I.
Really?
Well, how much milk does the cow give in a month?
Mummy knows. I can count on my fingers.
Fetch her some water.
I know, I know.
In camp I never grasped a word, but I understand her German.
Go see Mummy.
A bit flea-bitten!
I did my best.
I was talking to Father Christmas.
Joseph has a fine beard!
And here's the Virgin Mary.
You like my little donkey?
And my ox?
And the infant Jesus... of my own race?
A dig at me", as Boeldieu would say.
I wonder if he's all right.
Better not talk about it.
We're ready. Let's wake Lotte.
Hang on. The gramophone and the candles.
Lights out!
Lotte! Baby Jesus has come.
I knew He would!
Is it for me?
Yes.
I want the baby!
To take to bed?
No, to eat.
It's not to eat!
She wants to eat Baby Jesus!
Strictly forbidden"!
Then I'll eat Joseph!
All right, but in bed.
What?
She wants Joseph.
She wants Joseph?
There you go then.
Come on, to bed!
You're a good little girl.
That thing's on the blink!
How do you say "Lotte has blue eyes"?
Good night, kiddo!
I don't know how to thank you.
Thank us?
What can we say?
Well... goodnight.
I'll get the coffee.
It's ready.
Say it in French.
Have you told her we're leaving?
Not yet.
It's high time...
You go and tell her...
We must go on...
I know.
Maréchal couldn't bear to tell you.
Why?
I always knew he'd have to go.
Come along...
There's hot coffee.
You must eat something before you go.
Do we wait for dusk?
Yes.
Lotte! Let's say goodbye to the cow.
I was alone so long...
Waiting so long...
If you knew how happy I was to have a man about the house.
After war finished, if...
If I... not dead... understand?
Then I... come back here... yes?
And you... afterwards... go... with me... to France...
With Lotte, yes?
Here, for the journey.
Go quickly, it's better.
You're not looking back?
If I do, I might never leave.
Let's go.
Wait till dark.
We'd lose our way.
The woods are so thick... We'll crawl through the valley.
You're sure that's Switzerland?
I'm sure of it.
It's all so alike!
Of course, frontiers were invented by men, not by Nature.
I wish it were over.
I shall go back for Elsa.
You love her?
I reckon so.
Yet if we get through, we'll go back to our units and start again.
We've got to end this damn war... and make it the last!
What an illusion!
Come down to earth. What if we meet a patrol?
We split up, and try our luck.
Just in case, cheerio and so long!
So long, you "dirty Jew"!
So long, "old mate"!
Don't shoot, they're in Switzerland!
All the better for them!
humanity AND PAPER BALLOONS
Out of the way!
Stand watch!
What's going on?
He hanged himself.
Good morning.
What happened?
Kane, what happened?
Who hanged himself?
Morning! It's a bad start to a day, a suicide.
You can't leave now.
Why not?
What have I done?
I know, nobody's blaming you.
Kinya, wait until we've finished investigating.
That's too bad.
It's a sunny day.
First good weather for three days, and there's a suicide.
Turn around, they won't let you leave.
What are you talking about?
I can go wherever I want!
Ah ... maybe I will stay in.
Don't want to answer any questions ...
Why are you back?
There's an investigation, I have to wait.
Pity, it's a nice day.
Why did he kill himself?
It rained yesterday, he could have done it then.
Fool!
If you were going to die   what would you care about the weather?
That samurai should have slit his belly.
But he was old.
Still, it was a disgrace to hang himself.
He had no swords.
He carried a long one!
Yes, made of bamboo.
Couldn't cut his belly with that.
Get out of here!
Noisy brats!
You take tenants without references?
No surety either?
I didn't expect this.
Didn't you ask for one?
Of course I did.
I asked him for one, but ...
My wife is stupid!
I'm not interested in her stupidity.
Your tenants are always giving us trouble.
But ...
Anyway, report to the office.
Me?
The landlord's in for it!
Don't stand there gawping!
Your manners are deplorable!
Isn't this a moment for grief?
Why are you laughing, fool?
You're hopeless.
You may be blind, but you aren't deaf
You were right next door, but you heard nothing?
I didn't know ...
You should have known!
Who lives here?
Shinza, the hairdresser.
The noise hasn't woken him.
Shinza, wake up!
Can't you hear me?
is he out?
No, he's there.
Who is it?
Forgotten your landlord?
Get up!
is that you, sir? What's wrong?
How can you sleep through all this?
All what, sir?
Goldfish!
Shinza, you disappoint me.
Didn't think you were such a coward!
You kept as quiet as a borrowed cat.
You should've said something.
I couldn't get a word in!
Goldfish!
Hello, Landlord - Gen.
Are you alright?
Of course ...
How's business?
Slow ...
I started late today and I've sold only five.
Goldfish!
Forget the stupid goldfish!
Goldfish!
Damn it, what is a goldfish?
Have you gone mad?
I've been singing "Goldfish!" all morning.
I forget what they are and who I am.
Goldfish!
Move away, you noisy man.
Landlord, what if I have a drink while I can't think straight?
How should I know?
I've never had the chance.
Shall we hold a wake for the samurai?
A wake?
His soul will still be here tonight.
Good idea!
He was your neighbour, he'll be grateful for a wake.
Good, then give us five bottles.
Five bottles of what?
Sake, of course.
Will five be enough?
There you are.
Probably not!
We'll manage ... He was our neighbour, after all.
Five bottles.
Fool, why should I buy you sake?
It's for his soul.
Have the wake without sake! That'd be better.
It's the third suicide here.
They say the lane is haunted.
A party will liven the place up.
It'll help you get a new tenant.
He's right, and for only five bottles of sake.
Isn't that great?
A bad omen!
Join us, Unno-san.
No, I don't drink.
Shinza, I can see a halo over your head!
Don't worship me, I'm no saint on a cross!
Not on a cross, a real, live saint!
I'm glad to have you as my neighbour!
Have another cup.
We're out of sake for the saint.
Aren't they amazing?
It's a party, not a wake.
Aren't they sorry for the dead man?
We should do this once a month!
It rejuvenates us.
That's true.
Why don't you do it next month?
Me? Do what?
Hang yourself!
We'll all be grateful.
Gen! You took my fish!
That's why you sit beside me.
You think I can't see?
Look!
I know, it's Yoshichi.
What's the point of covering a blind man's eyes, fool?
is he really blind?
Look, a blind man smoking!
Say, Yoshichi...
Can't a blind man smoke?
Why not?
Can you tell me?
Isn't everyone enjoying themselves?
Hello, Landlord.
Don't drum on the bowls, you'll bring the dead man back.
Sit down here, Landlord.
We're almost out of sake.
What?
You drunken wretches ...
You're a fine man Giving us five bottles for the party.
Party?
What party?
I mean the wake.
Actually, it's all the same
You'll pay the price for it tomorrow.
Behaving like this ...
Who bought this fish?
I did, at the restaurant.
Whoever prepared it ...
Fish isn't good when it's sliced this thin.
I don't like it
Quite right!
You heard?
It's sliced too thin.
Order more fish and sake from the restaurant.
But not so thin-sliced this time.
No need to pay, it's the Landlord's order.
Thank you, Landlord!
I told you!
You drank too much.
Give me some water.
He always gets a hangover when the drinks are free.
He's like a toad when he throws up ... disgusting!
Good morning.
Have you seen my pipe anywhere?
You've lost your pipe?
Didn't you see it last night? My silver pipe?
I didn't.
Strange, I left it somewhere last night.
Maybe Gen stole it!
That must be it!
What are you saying?
I stole your pipe?
Gen, is that you?
You're always blaming me when you lose things.
Don't be angry.
You were beside me, I thought you might know.
I've no idea, I wasn't watching your pipe.
So what's that in your mouth?
This? Well ...
You can't see, can you?
No, but I can hear ... There's something in your mouth.
It's a toothpick.
A toothpick, not your pipe.
Which is Shinza's place?
Shinza? That one.
Go round the back.
Please, may I hide? -What's wrong?
He's gone!
Where did he go?
What's he done?
We'll cut him into pieces when we catch him!
We'll come back later.
Tell him Yatagoro's men will get him.
Thank you! They've gone.
Goodbye.
Be careful, use the front door.
It's all right.
Will you go out now, dear?
Yes, it's about time.
Good morning.
Come out, everyone, you're needed here.
I've made some lots ... Draw one each.
What for?
No questions, just draw one.
A gift?
Who knows?
You're being kind!
Let me draw one.
Not for you, blind man.
Why not?
What's this?
Acircle ...
What does it mean?
Agold coin?
It's cleaning duty.
I've got a circle too.
It reads "carry".
Carry" ... What do we have to carry, Landlord?
I got "carry" too.
Carry the coffin to the temple.
The coffin?
Mr Mori! Aren't you Mr Mori?
Do I know you?
Have you forgotten? I'm Matajuro Unno.
Unno?
Matabei Unno's son.
I remember ... Mr Unno's son.
It's been a long time! How's your family?
Fine, thank you ...
How is your father?
He died last year.
Dead?
I'm sorry, I didn't know.
You've been in Edo since his death?
I'm a poor man, as you see, I'm ashamed of myself.
I'm living in Edo now, so visit my house some day.
Thank you, sir.
To tell the truth, since I heard you moved to Edo   I've visited your house often, but you were never in.
is that so?
Sorry, I'm a busy man.
Goodbye.
Mr Mori ...
Yes?
I have a request.
My father wrote you a letter before he died.
I have it here ... Would you please read it?
I'm sorry, I'm busy today.
I'll read it when you visit my house.
Excuse me ...
Mr Mori ... I shouldn't ask, but ... I look shabby, so your guards don't admit me.
They won't allow me to see you.
No, that cannot be true.
You must be mistaken.
Come tomorrow.
Mr Mori, it won't take long.
I can explain as we walk.
But this is where l'm going.
is that so?
Then I'll wait here until you've finished.
It will take some time.
I don't mind waiting.
Welcome.
It's Mori-san ...
Good day, Mr Mori.
Your father?
He's waiting inside ... Do come in.
Mr Mori, I'll wait here.
You're with someone?
Clerk, I'll wait here.
Please do.
Offer him a cushion.
No need, thank you.
I've been expecting you, Mr Mori Thank you for being so kind
Shall we invite in your companion?
You have a companion?
Bring him in.
No, he's not actually with me.
He's bothering me.
He's a member of your clan?
He used to be, but now he's a ronin. Masterless.
We met in the road and he started pleading with me ...
Can you help me get rid of him?
By force, if necessary.
I understand.
Kyubei, ask Yatagoro to send some men.
Yes, sir.
We have trouble with cheats and criminals in the pawn shop too.
What times we live in!
Chushichi!
Go to the herbalist at the corner.
Ask them to send the usual medicine quickly.
Okinu, call Chushichi
Mr Mori is here, Miss Okoma.
Call him!
But Mr Mori is here ... I want Chushichi!
Yes, Miss.
No samurai could marry the daughter of a merchant.
It would be a disgrace.
Just so.
And so I'm taking Miss Okoma as my foster daughter.
I understand, sir, thank you.
You want me?
Chushichi, I have a problem.
Mr Mori is here ...
That's the problem.
Come and greet him, everyone's waiting for you.
What are you saying?
Your father and grandfather are there too.
No!
What's wrong?
You're mean.
Shall we go through?
Stop pretending!
Are you making fun of me?
But Mr Mori is waiting ...
You know what he's here to talk about?
Marriage.
Whose?
I don't know.
The groom is the son of a noble samurai.
Congratulations.
Chushichi, are you serious?
Fine, I'll go and tell them the truth!
No, I was joking!
What?
Clerk, what's going on?
Who are they?
I'm telling you to get out!
Go!
I'm not trying to cheat or blackmail you.
I'm just waiting for Mr Mori.
Tell me outside!
This is a respectable pawn shop! You're in the way!
Wait!
I need to speak with Mr Mori!
Really?
You want a fight?
Shinza!
What do you want?
Damn you!
Why did you run away?
I didn't ... lsuke, what have I done?
Don't play the innocent, we have proof
Come and face the boss.
I'm back.
Welcome home.
You're early today.
What happened?
Nothing ... I tripped on a stone.
Be more careful.
It's nothing, it doesn't hurt.
I grazed my arm.
Was Mr Mori there?
I met him on the way.
We talked as we walked, but very briefly.
He's busy, couldn't spare me much time.
He wants to see me tomorrow.
Otaki, can I have supper now?
Yes.
Did you give him the letter?
No, I'll take it to his house tomorrow.
I'll bring good news tomorrow, don't worry.
He can't refuse me when he's read the letter.
He didn't reach his position without help.
My late father's support was crucial.
He wouldn't have been promoted without it.
He'll remember that, and he'll be glad to help me.
The ointment is in the sewing box.
I see.
It does hurt a bit.
Thank you for your help.
Strangers come in, expecting to borrow against worthless junk.
We're at your service.
Our men are always ready.
Thank you very much.
A small token of our gratitude, for your men.
You're too generous.
Your master is always too kind.
He should be here himself ... Please accept this.
It's too much.
Tell him I'm grateful.
Chushichi ...
You can join our party tonight.
At Genta's place.
Thank you, sir.
You like gambling, I know.
You know your limits, you're a careful gambler.
You're kind to say so ...
But the shop keeps me very busy.
Not to mention the girls! You're handsome! They like you.
You're joking!
Don't deny it.
I've heard people talking.
I'll join you if I have time.
Tell your employers how grateful I am.
Give them my respects.
Thank you ...
So I'll be leaving now.
Excuse me.
Shinza! You know why you're here?
Well, do you?
I don't think I need to tell you.
You can't hide from us!
Look up!
That's better.
You think I'm a scarecrow or something?
You held a gambling party in my territory?
Shouldn't we punish him?
Come on, Shinza!
Don't ...
He's not worth the trouble.
But he needs punishment. -Never mind.
Shinza ...
Answer me!
So you can hear and speak!
You deserve severe punishment, but   there's no need to punish an amateur like you.
I'll forgive you.
Thank you ... I'm sorry ...
You and your gambling party!
You're a hairdresser!
Stick to your own trade!
Shinza, are we safe?
Why? I hear Boss Yatagoro nabbed you.
What can he do to me?
This is his territory ...
Gambling's illegal, anyway Don't worry.
It's Jin ...
Noodles!
Jin! Be quiet!
Shinza! Want some noodles?
No! Shut up!
But you have customers there.
Please, master.
Master"?
Who are you talking to?
You! Master Shinza.
You're impossible!
All right, put out that light and bring some up.
Thank you
Quiet! Put out the light!
Noodle-man!
No light?
I've sold out, I'm sorry.
Sold out?
Who are those bowls for?
Who ordered them?
Well ... somebody ...
Shinza lives here, doesn't he?
It's Shinza! He's doing it again!
I'm sorry ...
Mr Mori doesn't know you.
What?
You can have this letter back.
Wait! Please wait ...
Did Mr Mori say he didn't know me?
That makes no sense.
It can't be true.
I saw him yesterday, we talked for a while.
He asked me to come here today.
That's why I'm here.
Please tell him again that it's Matabei Unno's son.
Remind him we met yesterday!
Sorry about that trouble, old man.
Shinza!
They wrecked my place last night.
Sorry about that ... I'll make it up to you.
No ... How about you?
I fled across the roofs.
Give me a drink.
What happened, Shinza?
Nothing.
What'll you have to eat?
Anything will do.
You'd better lie low.
If Yatagoro's men catch you, there'll be hell to pay.
Not too hot, old man.
Mr Unno!
What a surprise!
Won't your wife scold you for coming here?
That was terrible yesterday.
Outside the pawn shop.
You know about that?
I'm ashamed of myself, they caught me off guard.
Let's drink together, Mr Unno.
I should go home now.
Not so soon.
Thanks anyway But I've had enough.
Old man, how much is it?
Never mind.
I'll pay later, then. No need for that.
How much is it?
The trouble is, he's still a proud man.
That's right.
I'll drink with you instead.
You're a clever one!
I like Mr Unno when he drinks here.
He's like one of us, more or less.
Can you lend me two ryo?
Two ryo?
No, I paid the liquor store this morning.
Shinza, you want to hold another gambling party?
I lost everything last night, I'm broke.
I'll pawn something.
Old man, can you go to my place?
Find my hairdressing tools in the cupboard.
Hairdressing?
Bring them here.
You want to go back to hairdressing?
Good evening.
Welcome.
Sorry, I'm disturbing you.
Your master is out?
I'm afraid I've intruded.
Not at all!
You don't need to be shy, I completely understand.
No-one else is here?
Sorry, they're all out.
That's convenient.
I want to pawn this ... Lend me two ryo.
I need it right away.
Hairdressing tools ...
No value. Don't turn me down, I need the money.
No questions, no buts, just approve the loan.
You say "no value", but they're valuable to me.
I'll pay it back quickly.
We give loans only against items of general value.
Not on things like that.
Reconsider!
Business is business ...
No loan. It means to me what a sword means to a samurai.
You gamble too, you must understand my problem.
Oh, shouldn't have mentioned that here ...
A slip of the tongue.
How could you say that? You disgrace our shop!
Forgive me! Nobody else heard.
I'm back, sir.
Quick, go to the herbalist.
The herbalist?
Hurry, I want the usual preparation.
Can't you reconsider?
I see, I'm wasting my time.
I thought you'd understand.
But you turned me down ...
You could bring something else.
Those tools are no better than old wooden shoes.
What are you saying?
Shinza, go home quickly ...
while you still can.
Chushichi ...
Give him the loan.
It's only two ryo.
No thanks!
I'm not a beggar! What do you know about money?
You think it grows on trees, don't you?
Shinza! Stop!
You can't get away!
They're fighting!
Boss Yatagoro is here.
What have you done, Chushichi?
I taught him a small lesson.
How does that feel, Shinza?
You're lucky to be alive!
Pipes!
Change your pipe stems!
I need a new stem ...
By the way, that silver pipe of yours ... I lost it.
I know who took it! Shall I tell you?
I already know, it was Gen.
If you know, why don't you get it back?
To be frank, it needs a new stem.
The old one keeps clogging.
Gen will replace the stem, and then I'll take it back.
So you're one step ahead of him!
Won't you go out today?
Yes, I will.
I gave the letter to Mr Mori, so I'll go to see him.
I'd like to visit my sister in Mukojima.
I haven't seen her for some time.
When?
I'll go today, if you don't mind.
All right ... stay there for a few days.
I'll come back tomorrow.
No, it's time you took a rest.
You don't look well.
Don't worry about me, I can cook for myself.
There are some coins in the sewing box.
Don't drink too much.
Drinking will affect your health again.
You knew I'd had a drink yesterday?
I see, I'm sorry I didn't tell you.
Mr Mori forced me to drink.
I only had a little.
I won't drink again.
It took me so long to regain my health.
No drinks.
No work today?
I'm waiting for the festival tonight.
That's right, it's a festival day.
What the ...?
The festival?
Hope it doesn't rain tonight!
I knew there'd be bad weather.
It's pouring!
What shall we do?
It won't stop soon.
Chushichi, what are you going to do?
Wait here, I'll go fetch an umbrella for you.
Who needs an umbrella?
Let's go home.
I'll get that umbrella, wait here.
Chushichi! -l'll be back.
Chushichi is a fool! Acoward!
Miss Okoma?
What are you doing here?
I'll take you home.
Such a snob!
Oh, it's raining.
You'd better wait.
No, I have to see the groom's father.
Then I'll find a sedan
We can look together.
Chomatsu!
Wait inside, sir.
Thank you.
Mr Mori!
It's me, Matajuro Unno.
Oh, it's you ... You surprised me.
Forgive me.
When we met   you told me to visit your house the next day.
So I went there.
But your guard wouldn't listen to me.
He wouldn't let me see you.
I had to leave.
That's why I've waited to catch you like this.
Forgive my sudden appearance.
Mr Mori, please listen to me.
You're wetting my clothes!
I'm sorry, forgive me.
You're very persistent! I'm busy this evening.
Come tomorrow.
Tomorrow?
I will.
Thank you.
Mr Mori, I'll come to your house at eight in the morning.
is that all right?
Eight in the morning.
Please tell your guard my name: Matajuro Unno.
Please instruct him to receive me.
Please don't forget to tell him to let me in.
Let me help you.
My regards to him, sir.
Tomorrow morning at eight.
Unno!
Don't come to my house.
Don't approach me on the street.
Hurry!
Mr Mori!
Chomatsu! is Miss Okoma back?
No, I thought she was with you.
Here, your tip.
I won't ask you to keep this a secret.
In fact, tell the pawn shop people that she's here.
Tell other people too!
Okoma ...
Don't be afraid.
Be quiet, and I won't harm you.
If you cry out, you'll get hurt.
Where are you going?
Home. Quiet!
Let go of me! Chushichi, help me!
Shinza ...
What's going on?
Mr Unno.
Aren't you asleep?
It's nothing.
But I heard a woman crying.
You heard her?
That's why I told her to keep quiet.
She may make some noise, so please be patient.
I don't mind, but what's the matter?
I brought her here ... Okoma from the pawn shop.
You mean Kuzaemon's daughter?
Yes! You've heard the rumours, haven't you?
She's going to marry the son of a noble samurai.
Excuse me.
I see.
Shinza, what's this all about?
This way! Hurry!
What's going on? Something wrong?
What's happened?
Did someone hang himself?
Where have you hidden her?
Hidden? Who?
Shinza, let's be frank.
If it was just any girl   we'd kill you and take her home.
But she's an important person.
Her father wants her brought home discreetly.
Don't make me lose face, let me take her home.
Sorry to disappoint you, but I refuse.
What are you saying?
Don't push your luck! You punk!
You say you refuse, Shinza, but you can't be so proud.
Kidnapping is a serious crime.
Whatever's going on in your head, think of your own safety!
You're breaking the law!
Come on, Shinza.
Better make a deal while you still can.
Let me settle it ... Here, with my compliments.
Take this money.
Boss, what's this for?
What do you want to buy?
Five ryo is enough!
Keep your nose out of this!
I have no reason to accept this.
Take it back.
You won't accept it?
You mean five ryo isn't enough?
Her father Kuzaemon should have come here himself.
I don't want to deal with you.
Are you picking a fight? This is Yatagoro, you know!
is that all you had to say?
Kidnapping is a crime" ... as if I kidnapped her!
It's true that the girl came here last night.
But it wasn't a crime, it was a love affair.
We promised to marry each other someday.
But she's been promised to a samurai's family.
So she ran away to be with me.
Who'd believe that story!
You'll never know, sourpuss.
Sourpuss" he called him!
Shinza got that right!
I'm staying calm because it's not worth fighting you.
But if you insist ... I know.
You're a specialist in fighting and gambling.
You use force to solve problems ... but not this time.
Love is not your province.
Enough fancy talk, make yourself clear!
You refuse, no matter what?
It depends.
You mean five ryo isn't enough?
I'm not as cheap as you!
I don't want money.
I want you to ...
You want him to what?
... shave your head.
Shave your head like a monk.
And say "Forgive me, Shinza, I was wrong"
Then Okoma is yours.
Her father said to be discreet.
He wants the gang boss to shave his head! Amazing!
He knows we can't lay a hand on him, damn him!
Shinza, you'll be sorry!
Get out!
Shinza, did you really bring the girl here?
Where have you hidden her?
Let me take a look at her!
What's this nonsense?
He did that?
Great!
I'm proud of my tenants.
They know how to make money!
It's the landlord!
Good morning.
Good-for-nothing!
Oto! Jin! Let Shinza be an example to you!
This is why I care for you so much!
Follow his example!
Get out!
Shinza, I hear you've done a great thing.
Good morning, Landlord.
I admire you, you've got guts.
Beat a famous man and you'll be more famous yourself"
You flatter me.
You threw back Yatagoro's money?
Great!
He's scum.
That's right, don't let him scare you.
It was a cheap offer.
Five ryo!
How stingy!
He'd certainly get much more than that himself.
How much are you holding out for?
I don't want any money.
What?
Don't tell me you don't want money!
Why else did you kidnap her?
Because I don't like to see a master acting like a king.
You'll give her back?
Of course... if the clerk comes himself.
Keep your voice down, fool!
You'll go blind if you say such things!
If they cast pearls before you, pick them up!
Maybe that's why I went blind! Didn't pick up the pearls!
Shut up! Don't stand there, go away!
Shinza, leave it to me ... I'll settle the matter.
Where is the girl, anyway?
I should see her before I go to the pawn shop.
Where is she?
Act your age!
You're too old for young girls.
She's important!
Don't let a mouse bite her nose!
Where is she?
Never you mind.
All right.
But I warn you, Shinza, don't hurt her!
Don't you worry.
She's not a chicken ...
If she dies, she's worthless.
You realise that?
Where can she be?
SHlRAKOYA PAWN SHOP
CLOSED TODAY -
This is very embarrassing.
I'm sorry.
The groom's father will be furious.
I'm finished.
Yatagoro's men are here, sir.
They're back?
Don't worry, Mr Mori, they're back.
Miss Okoma's back safely!
Yatagoro didn't convince him?
It's our fault.
We underestimated him, he's really tough.
Okoma?
Where is she?
is she safe?
Great Master ...
What happened?
They failed
What?
Failed?
Yatagoro failed?
As it happens, things didn't go as well as planned ...
Shinza was unreasonable ... We lost our tempers.
I apologise.
How could you come back empty-handed?
Where's Yatagoro?
I want to see him.
He lost face ... He's so ashamed, he can't see you.
As a token of apology, we'll kill Shinza.
Fool! Who asked you to kill him?
I asked Yatagoro to bring Okoma back safely.
What if she gets hurt?
What if she dies?
Good morning!
Nice day, isn't it?
Please bring her.
Shinza!
Landlord ...
Don't say anything, just hand over the girl
Take her away! She's next door.
Mr Unno, thank you for keeping her! Let her go!
She's at Mr Unno's?
Come over!
She's at Mr Unno's.
Surprised?
He's not such a bad man, after all! Let's get you home.
You'll be stronger for this experience.
If this happened more often, I'd be rich!
Chushichi!
Out of my way! Don't stare at her!
What are you staring at, blind man?
Thank you
Don't mention it! Off you go!
Step outside, Shinza, they're all talking about you.
You got the better of Boss Yatagoro.
It's good to know that his name is so small now.
I'm proud of you.
Why are you flattering me?
I always thought you had talent.
Look, her father gave me fifty ryo.
You took his money?
Of course, that's why I stepped in!
I did it from pride, not for money.
You don't want money?
I do, if you pay me
Good!
It's always nice to look at gold coins.
Come on, Shinza, let's have a game.
What for?
First pick.
You want half of it?
Of course!
You're too greedy.
Seeing the money makes you greedy.
You said you didn't want any of it!
But half is too much.
Shinza, think about it.
What if the police had become involved?
I brokered the deal.
I let you be so that I could collect my share.
Understand?
Now, let's play.
Winner picks first.
How silly! I'm not playing.
Give up?
You win.
That's more like it! Good man.
I'll take my share first.
I'll buy sake ... Let's have a party!
Just what I wanted to hear.
To the restaurant!
Jin! Shinza's buying sake!
Too bad I just ate.
You're not coming?
Who says I'm not?
Mr Unno ... Join us for a drink.
No thank you
Come on ... This is your share.
Take it, Mr Unno.
No, I didn't ...
Take it!
Now, come on.
Mr Unno made it possible ...
Gen, I don't want you sitting beside me again!
Shut up!
Don't say that, just have a drink with us.
You can't refuse us.
Shinza, it's on you.
I never dreamed Mr Unno would be involved.
I thought better of him.
He looks decent, but he's as bad as the rest of them.
Samurai are wicked these days ...
No better than my man.
All men are scoundrels.
I'm sick of them.
I'm afraid I was too hasty.
I could have got another ten or twenty out of them.
Your greed has no end.
That's not the point.
The samurai named Mori fell to pieces.
His face went as pale as wax.
He prostrated himself and begged me to help.
Really?
The samurai named Mori?
He prostrated himself and begged you?
That's funny ...
Shinza knew our weakest point.
We didn't know what to do.
Sorry I brought you into it.
But we couldn't go to the police.
Fifty ryo wasn't much to pay.
True, and she's safe now Fifty ryo wasn't much.
She must have been shocked.
She's asleep.
You'd better let her rest for a while.
Your medicine, Miss Okoma.
Chushichi?
is Mr Mori still here?
I was wrong, Miss Okoma.
Let's run away and live together.
Mr Unno ...
Don't leave so soon, have another drink.
You're not a bit drunk.
I'll come back ...
My wife may be home by now.
I'll check, and then come back.
Make sure you do!
You have my word.
Wait!
What do you want?
Come with us.
Where to?
Enmado Bridge.
Enmado Bridge?
Wait there for me.
Don't think of running away.
Listen, everyone, I have to go somewhere.
I'll be back later. Where are you going?
Are you running away?
I thought you'd think that.
Keep this for me, old man.
Drink as much as you want, the old man has my money.
What a generous man!
Where are you going?
Enmado Bridge.
If you're going there, could you do me a favour?
I borrowed an umbrella from Sagami-ya last night.
Would you return it for me?
All right, I will.
You're back ...
When did you get here?
Your sister and her family, were they fine?
I'm glad to hear it.
Are they dry?
It was hot last night.
I went to the festival.
I'm sorry ...
Have you eaten?
Where have you been?
I went to Mr Mori's house, but there was trouble.
Mr Mori was furious.
Not with me.
Maybe you've heard ...
He takes care of the pawn shop owner's daughter.
She's going to marry a samurai's son.
But things didn't go to his plan.
My request will be put aside for a while.
I'm unlucky.
But don't worry ...
He finally read my father's letter.
Everything will be all right.
I gave him the letter, don't worry.
Men, stay back.
Shinza, prepare to die!
lsuke, don't forget to return the umbrella.
To Sagami-ya, on the other side of the bridge.
Adouble suicide!
Out of the way!
Where's the landlord?
Boy, fetch the landlord.
Where are you going?
The landlord's house.
All right, fetch him.
How do you like that?
There he is again.
I've thrown him out twice.
What's the big idea, do I have to get rough? - Please, I have to see Mr. Stokowski.
Not tonight, you don't.
Thank you!
Please pardon me, won't you please?
With such a crowd out front, you'd better leave by the side entrance.
Yes, I think I'll go by that door over there. - Is that my coat there?
You have received another cable from Paris.
They want an answer immediately. - I know, but let's talk about that tomorrow,
not after the concert. - Mr. Stokowski. Mr. Stokowski, I've been trying to see you for a long, long time...
How did you get in here?
It's all right... - I'm a musician, and I need work very badly, Mr. Stokowski.
Oh, I am so sorry, we must do something...
Of course, I'll explain that you can't accept this.
Yes, please do so, we'll arrange that in the morning.
Mr. Stokowski, please let me try to...
Oh, yes. Will you speak to this gentleman? I must go now.
Will you excuse me?
What is it, please?
My name is Cardwell, John Cardwell.
I'm a trombone player, and I haven't had any work in two years
and I came here tonight to see if I could... - Suppose you try writing to the management?
I've done all that.
Look, here's the answer.
Now, I'm in a hurry.
I've written at least 20 letters. Nobody pays any attention to the letters.
Well, it's perfectly clear, we've nothing for you.
Well now, don't put me off like this. I wouldn't have come here like a beggar if I hadn't been desperate. - All I want is a job.
Oh, there you are.
How do you like this guy?
Now listen, please...
I want to tell you...
He's been trying to crash the stage door for months.
Now look here, I've got a little daughter, and if I don't get a job, listen, we'll be thrown out in the street tomorrow!
That's not my fault.
Well, I know, but all I want is a job!
The next time I catch you in here, I'll throw you out on your ear!
Goodnight, now.
Everyone get your morning paper! Paper!
Morning paper!
Paper, mister? Paper!
Paper!
I beg your pardon, madam, but did you drop this?
No, thank you, I have mine.
You'd better turn it in... over there.
Thank you.
Uh, I beg your pardon, sir, but I... Say!
Don't you know when to quit?
Oh, Mr. Cardwell, just a moment, please.
I must ask for your room in the morning. I'm keeping your trunks, of course, until you pay me what you owe.
I've waited as long as I possibly could.
'Course, I feel sorry for Patsy.
Your very touching sympathy is unnecessary, Mrs. Tyler.
Here's your money, comes to 52 dollars, correct?
Why, Mr. Cardwell, how wonderful!
Then you got the engagement with Stokowski?
Yes, I got it.
Daddy!
Oh, Daddy, I knew it, I knew it!
Couldn't go on like that forever, could it?
Oh, I'm so happy!
Darling, I...
Is it true?
Yes, Mr. Cardwell and Mr. Stokowski have finally come to terms.
Daddy, did you play for him?
What did he say? Is he nice?
Yes, darling. Let's go upstairs.
Oh, but Daddy, can't we stay down here and... - Darling, please let me take off my coat!
Isn't it great? I'm so happy for the little girl's sake.
Oh, Daddy, I knew when you left here that you'd get it.
Won't it be marvelous?
We'll have money again, be able to pay everybody.
And you can get a new suit so you won't have to go 'round with shiny elbows anymore.
And this hat is terrible, but we'll get you a new one.
Oh, aren't you happy, Daddy?
Now, Patsy darling, listen.
That old battle axe!
I'll make her bring the trunks back.
Right away!
And Michael! He should know about it.
Michael, Daddy got a job! We have money! We paid the rent!
Huh? - Daddy got a job with Stokowski!
I'll be right back!
Congratulations!
Now Stokowski's in luck too, tell him I said so.
When you see him next, tell him you know the best flautist in the country, me, Borodoff.
It isn't true, Michael.
What do you mean, it isn't true?
You know I was with the greatest orchestras in the world.
It isn't true that I got a job.
Well, where did you get the money?
Steal it?
Found it.
Patsy's so happy about it, how can I tell her?
Don't.
Well, that's impossible.
All right, I'll get it, just a minute.
Daddy, they want you to come downstairs and have a drink with them. - Mrs. Connell's opening up some beer.
But Patsy, don't you think we'd better wait?
Oh, we have to celebrate.
Come on, Cardwell, everybody's waiting, come on right down, there's beer!
I need no signs, I need no chart, The weather bureau in my heart is saying it's raining sunbeams.
The world is young, it's spring again, and I can laugh and sing again, for I know it's raining sunbeams.
Now that there's a rainbow-colored sky on display, each gray yesterday seems so far away.
Those golden darts from paradise are pouring down to break the ice.
Go write or phone, make it known to everyone you love.
It's raining sunny sunbeams from above.
Those golden darts from paradise are pouring down to break the ice.
Go write or phone, make it known to everyone you love.
It's raining sunny sunbeams from above.
Now we can pay all our bills.
Daddy, please don't move.
Next week we'll pay three months'...
Daddy. - Do you still need this ear?
Yes, darling.
Then sit still, please.
Yes, dear.
How can I cut this mop? Do you want to be laughed at at rehearsal?
What would Mr. Stokowski say?
Darling, Mr. Stokowski has...
Yes, I know, but he can wear his hair any way he likes.
He can even braid it if he wants to.
He's the boss.
Well, that's marvelous!
Without disturbing the original line.
Looks all right, doesn't it?
We'd better hurry, it's almost time for rehearsal.
You're not going with me, are you?
Of course I am! - I wouldn't let you go alone your first day...
You're staying here and that's that!
Daddy!
Oh my darling, please forgive me.
I'm sorry, I wouldn't hurt you for the world. I'm nervous.
If you were there, I don't think I could play.
Oh, that's all right.
I'll stay home. - You don't mind, do you, dear?
Of course not, I understand.
Goodbye dear,
Goodbye, Daddy.
Your trombone! Oh.
Thank you, dear. I'll see you tonight for dinner.
And good luck!
Good morning, Patsy!
Where are you going so early?
To the rehearsal.
Well, why didn't you go with your father?
I don't want him to know I'm there.
It'll make him nervous.
Good morning!
Hey, where are you going?
Just upstairs to rehearsal, - see if everything's all right.
No visitors allowed!
That's right. You keep them out.
Hey, you can't go up there!
I'd like you to know my father is the first trombone player in this orchestra!
That doesn't make no difference, Miss Mitzenkopf, you can't go up there.
What was that?
My name is Cardwell.
Huh. There's no Cardwell here.
Oh yes there is, but he's a new member and you probably haven't heard of him.
There hasn't been a new man in this orchestra for over two years.
Now, come on.
But... but he was here last night, he even played for Mr. Stokowski!
Why, he even signed a contract and...
Oh! Is he a skinny guy with a mustache and a shabby overcoat?
Yes, that's right.
Oh, that guy.
Yes!
I threw him out myself. He ain't got no job here.
You tell him if he don't stop annoying people, he's gonna get himself in trouble.
Now, you beat it.
Hey! You can't go up there!
Let me go, let me go!
Quiet! There's an orchestra rehearsal up there!
I don't care!
Your move.
Come on, come on, your move.
Sorry, Michael.
Now, look at that. Snap out of it, you've been worried all day.
Say, that rehearsal must be over by now.
What time... uh, Freddy, what time is it?
You'll have to call up my pawnbroker and ask him.
Say, Oscar, got a watch? - Yes.
A millionaire!
What time is it?
Ten to six.
I must be going.
Come on. Maybe Patsy's got enough dinner for the both of us.
Now, look, I'll go in first and you come up later and talk about the rehearsal and tell her how good I was, will you?
Keep things going. Well, how long do you think you can fool her?
I'll keep her happy as long as I can.
Not with that face... You'd better pep up and smile. You look more like an undertaker than a trombone player who just got a job.
Hello, Patsy darling!
Hello, Daddy.
It certainly feels good to get home after a hard day's work!
Does it?
You should have heard me play today, I was splendid!
After the rehearsal, Stokowski put his arms around my shoulders, patted me on the back and said, "John, my friend... ".
Daddy!
I was there.
Why did you have to do it?
You never lied to me before.
I got into it. You were so happy.
Where did that money come from?
I found a purse last night. Found... a purse?
In front of the concert hall. I tried to find the owner.
I didn't know what to do.
And when I came home, Mrs. Tyler demanded her rent.
I couldn't have you put out on the street!
Is the money all gone, Daddy?
No, I think there's some of it left.
Let... let me see it.
See, I came to tell you I met one of the orchestra.
You sure made a hit with Stokie.
I mean it! You went over like a million.
Patsy, do you know what I heard about Daddy?
Quiet, Michael.
Does she know?
Yes.
Well, then why did you tell me to tell her that somebody told me to tell you that Stokowski told you you were great?
Patsy, where are you going?
I'm going to return this.
But where? I found the address in the bag.
But you haven't had your dinner, you'll be hungry.
That doesn't matter, Daddy.
What are you going to tell them about the money?
I'll tell them the truth.
Say, tell me, why isn't your husband here tonight?
Oh, he's down at his car factory.
He's trying to organize a company starting to grow rubber trees.
Oh really, you don't say?
I beg your pardon, madam.
Yes, Stevens. There's a young lady in the hall that says she found a bag of yours.
Bag?
Bag?
What bag? - The one you lost last night, madam.
Oh!
Oh, that one. Well, give her a reward and just put it in my bedroom.
Now, that Stokowski concert, I...
I beg your pardon, madam.
The young lady wishes to speak to you personally.
Personally, about a bag?
Isn't that odd!
Extraordinary.
Oh, hello, little girl. I hear you found my bag...
Well, perfectly charming.
I simply couldn't have worn the dress I was wearing without it.
And then when I heard the bag's returned, I wondered what dress I was wearing!
Oh, that one.
Oh, I remember now.
Oh, it all comes back to me.
Do... do you remember what was in it?
In the bag?
Well, let me see.
It's sort of a guessing game, obviously.
There was a cigarette case... Yes, there must have been a cigarette case, because you see I'm smoking now.
Yes, with diamonds.
Well, how odd, that's the one I thought I'd lost.
Isn't it strange it's shown up in this bag!
Do you... do you know what else was in it?
Well, let me see, a compact...
and soda mints, right?
Right. How's that for a memory?
And now, now I must pay you a reward, you know, for returning the bag.
Yes, 52 dollars and 10 cents, please.
The jeweled cigarette case is worth four times as much.
Well, I don't know, that's such an odd figure!
Fifty-two dollars and ten cents is what I'd like, please.
I know. You figured out what you'd ask coming up in the subway.
I'm afraid your sense of value is just as fantastic as mine.
You know, my husband's always amused at my sense of value!
Oh, Stevens, get me $200, please.
Only the amount I asked for, please.
Well, what was the amount you asked for?
Fifty-two dollars and ten cents.
I think I have it right here, madam.
Well, would you, uh, would you kindly give it to this lady and now we're square.
Square?
Yes, you see, we... we used the money that was in your purse for rent, and...
And ten cents for car fare.
Thank you and goodbye.
Isn't that the strangest thing? !
Don't go, my dear, don't go, you're too original and charming.
Would you stay and have dinner? Come, I want you to meet all my guests.
I want everyone to meet this charming little girl.
Come along and we'll see what there is for supper.
Oh, I couldn't really, I'm not dressed for a party.
Oh, but my dear, this is no party, just a few friends who drop in every night.
Come along, now, come along.
But if I'd known this was going to happen, I'd have worn my Sunday dress!
Oh, everybody, I want you to meet Miss, uh... What'd you say your name was, dear?
Patricia Cardwell!
Hello, Patricia!
Hello. Hello, hello, hello.
Come along dear, come over to the buffet and see what you'd like.
My name is Lintzman.
How do you do?
Would you like some hors d'oeuvres? I can recommend the hors d'oeuvres, Patricia.
Now, we have some chicken, or maybe you'd like some fresh caviar?
Well...
Caviar for Patricia, yes! - Some champagne, dear?
Oh no, just water, please.
Oh, I say, that will hatch them out!
Oh, don't you believe him, Patricia.
Oh, I don't... I know when someone's trying to be funny.
That'll do for you.
Oh, well that's all right! People have to amuse one another to keep the party going.
Darling, would you like a little roll?
No, thank you.
What's that?
That's pheasant.
Would you like some, dear? No, thank you.
Do they call you Patricia at home?
My father calls me Patsy.
Now, take the plates over to that table. Come along, dear, and have your supper.
What does your father do?
He's a musician.
Oh, a musician!
Yes, see, he plays the trombone.
Oh! Trombone!
What an original thing to pick up!
Is he good?
Oh, he's great, and he taught me to sing, too.
Oh, do you sing, dear?
I beg your pardon? - Do you sing?
Well, yes, a little.
Oh, well then, you must sing for us now.
You'd all like to hear her sing, wouldn't you?
Right now? - Yes, dear!
Not a thought, not a care, with a heart debonair I am free as the sea.
Like the lark who at dawn bids the darkness be gone do I sing merrily.
With a laugh and a dance, mine's a life to entrance, for I know naught but glee.
And the word that I bring and the theme that I sing is the song of a heart that's free.
Ah then, let music ring.
Ah-h-h-ha, while sweet voices sing.
Ahh, ahh, ahhh-ahhhh-ahhh-ah, echoes repeating, measures entreating, song of a heart light and free.
Laughing all the day, chasing cares away, hear my roundelay, ahh-ahh-ahh-ahh-ahh...
Not a thought, not a care, with a heart debonair I am free as the sea.
Like the lark who at dawn bids the darkness be gone do I sing merrily.
With a laugh and a dance, mine's a life to entrance, for I know naught but glee.
And the word that I bring and the theme that I sing is the song of my heart, my heart!
Well! Your father must be a very fine musician to teach you to sing like that.
Oh yes... oh yes, he is, he's wonderful.
Pardon me.
Well, we should like to hear him. Where does he play?
Well, right now, he's out of work.
Oh, that's impossible.
Try this one, dear, it's foie gras. - Thank you. - The trombone is such a novelty.
Oh, but there are thousands of musicians almost as good as my daddy right here in this city.
You don't say.
Yes, and they're all out of work. And I'd like to know why!
Will someone tell the poor little girl something? We can't leave her standing here in the dark.
Any answers?
Maybe we need more orchestras.
There you are, darling.
More orchestras.
Say, you know, that's an idea.
That's just what the matter is, we haven't enough orchestras.
Oh, that is an idea.
It's a dandy idea. - I'm going to start an orchestra.
Oh, how nice!
Well, wouldn't some of you rich people like to sponsor a fine symphony orchestra?
How much would you need?
Oh, isn't she droll?
Don't you think I could do it?
Of course you can.
If I get an orchestra together, would you sponsor it? You just bring me your orchestra and you'll see.
Do you really mean it?
Of course, darling!
Mrs. Frost's husband has a radio hour.
Maybe your orchestra can play on that.
Do you think so?
You bring me your orchestra and you'll see! Goodbye, everybody.
What about your supper?
Oh... oh, but this is more important!
Is my daddy here?
Over there playing cards.
Oh, don't go away, I have some important news for you.
What is it?
I'll tell you in a minute.
Daddy!
Quiet, quiet.
Daddy, I'm going to start an orchestra.
That's fine, dear.
Carl, are you in?
Did you take back that thing?
Yes, but listen, Daddy...
Sorry, Michael. You and Michael get together 100 musicians, the best ones you know.
Boys, I bid $20,000.
Daddy, we're going to have an orchestra!
All right, baby, all right.
Gustav, are you in?
Daddy, won't you please let me talk?
Please, Daddy! - Did you have your dinner, dear?
No, I came straight here, I couldn't wait for dinner.
What?
No dinner?
Oh, they gave me a sandwich... - They gave you a sandwich for that bag?
Daddy, won't you please listen?
Michael, are you in?
I'm out. Daddy, I can start a symphony orchestra. - Mrs. Frost said that I...
Mrs. who?
Mrs. John R. Frost.
She said that if I can organize a symphony orchestra, she's sponsor it and put it on her husband's radio hour.
Yes. Now, why would a woman fool a child that way?
Oh, but Daddy, she meant it.
It was a big party, and I told them straight to their faces that it was a shame so many musicians were out of work.
And somebody said, "We need more orchestras," that's all.
Just like that. - Just like that.
And I said I'd form a symphony orchestra if I only had a sponsor.
And Mrs. Frost said she'd be the sponsor.
Cocktail party, huh?
Yeah, but that doesn't matter because I asked them again, "Do you really mean it?"
And they said yes. If they said no, it'd have been different, but they said yes, Daddy.
They were drinking, huh?
Oh, Daddy, I have no time for such foolishness.
If I get her on the phone and you hear her say yes, then will you help me get an orchestra?
You'd better forget about it.
Oh, come on, Daddy, please!
Michael.
Michael, you come and then you'll all believe me. Then you'll understand when you hear her repeat it.
Hello.
Oh! Oh, it's you.
Oh, it's that darling little girl again.
Hello, Patricia.
Mrs. Frost, I can't make anybody believe that you're going to sponsor my orchestra on your husband's radio hour.
Oh, well you just tell them and they'll be surprised.
Oh, thank you! Will you kindly repeat it, please?
Here, Michael.
Oh, that isn't necessary.
You get your orchestra and let me know.
Yes, ma'am.
Who's that?
Hey, wait a minute... Patricia, who was that?
Hello?
Well, I hope that child's not going to prove a nuisance.
What did she say?
Did she say no?
She said yes.
She said no?
No, she said yes. - Well, then tell them that she said yes. Tell them what it is, Michael, hurry up, Michael!
Listen, everyone.
Listen, everybody, look, fellas.
Patsy got a sucker, and... - A sponsor!
Huh? Yes, a sponsor. It's the truth, I heard it with my own eyes!
Oh, Daddy, did you hear?
Do you believe me now?
It was the lady, what's her name, you know what's her name! The lady, you all know her.
Patsy, you tell them!
Everybody'll have money again. You'll all have jobs again.
I have a suck... a sponsor.
Who is it?
Mrs. John R. Frost. She promised me that if I could only get...
Oh, she promised, yes, I know that.
Now look, why not take a chance?
Yes, Daddy!
What have we got to lose?
Absolutely! - It sounds like a crazy scheme.
Oh, but it isn't!
All right, crazy scheme, we might as well be nuts as broke.
Absolutely. - Instead of sitting around here wasting our time playing cards, let's to through with this thing!
Good for you, Daddy!
Come on, boys, who's with me?
I am! - Me too!
When do we start, John?
Right away! But we have no place to rehearse.
We'll get one.
Next.
Your name? - Ben Davis, first violin.
First violin Davis, look, that chair right in front of the ramp.
Thank you.
What's your first name?
Nice place.
Nice Place Davis.
Hello, boys, how are you this morning?
Gustav Brandstetter, French horn.
In the brass section, please, Gustav.
Thank you.
When I left this morning, my wife said, "Gustav, you tell John this is wonderful."
And it is really, John, I haven't worked since a year.
Where am I going?
Come, Gustav, I'll show you.
Next, please.
Hey, sport, how's about my rent?
Didn't I tell you that my daughter's on her way to get it?
But you told me you were going to give me my money the minute you come into my garage.
Don't get excited.
But I don't have got it yet.
She'll be here any minute.
Up there to your left. Take that box and use it for a seat.
All right, boys, will everybody please pay attention for a moment?
I want the first and second violins here, violas here, and the cellos in front here.
I want for you to give me my money!
Will you please sit down and wait a minute, just one minute, and you'll get your money!
In front of the truck, the woodwinds.
There are not enough seats, Cardwell!
Well, what about the floor?
There's lots of room on the floor.
On the truck, the basses, percussion's there, and against the wall, the brass, all the brass up there.
Now come on, first violins over there, that's right, come on, hurry up.
First violins over here.
Now, is everybody...
Is everybody here, Michael?
Just one missing.
Who?
Who is missing?
It's on your list, can't you...
Sure. Michael Borodoff, flute.
Oh. That's me.
Quiet, everybody!
Hey, Michael!
Quiet!
Are we ready?
Allegro vivace.
Here we go.
The minute is over. I want my money.
Now, listen, my friend. My daughter has gone to get the money, in a taxi.
It takes 15 minutes to get there, 5 minutes to get the money, 15 minutes to get back.
She's been gone 30 minutes. She'll be here in five minutes.
Now, does that make sense?
I don't know nothing from arithmetics, I want my money.
Now, listen, it took three days to get these men together, we want to go to work.
I guarantee you your money. Now are you satisfied?
I satisfied.
That's fine.
But when do I get it?
All right, boys, let's go!
Stop this foolishness!
You can't play while losing my money!
Shut up!
You call me a shut up? You can't call me a shut up!
Get out of my garage!
This is a free country, and it's just as free for me as it is like for you.
You get out of here!
You can't hear me, my garage!
Well, everything's settled.
Where's Mrs. Frost?
Mrs. Frost isn't at home.
Isn't at home?
Well, where is she, where can I find her quickly?
Mrs. Frost left yesterday for Europe.
Europe?
Now what have you done?
I founded an orchestra.
This porcelain is priceless!
I've got a hundred men waiting for me in a garage.
What am I going to tell them?
What am I going to tell them?
Oh, Mr. Frost will discharge me for this!
Mr. Frost, didn't he go to Europe too?
No, he's here.
Here where?
Well, that is, he isn't here, he's at the Merchants Club.
The Merchants Club!
Hey, come back here!
You can't disturb Mr. Frost! You...
Where to now?
To the Merchants Club.
To the Merchants Club.
To the Merchants Club.
To the Merchants Club, to the Merchants Club.
Where all the merchants go.
Merchants short and merchants tall and merchants high and low.
Merchants big and merchants small, merchants not merchants at all.
What's that?
That's me, singin'. - Singing?
Sure.
Don't you like singin'?
Well, I didn't like that.
Kids nowadays, don't know nothin' 'bout music.
Nothin' 'bout music, nothin' 'bout song.
Nothin' 'bout nothin', that's what is wrong...
Sir, would you please watch where you're going?
Mrs. Frost left rather unexpectedly, didn't she?
Everything my wife does is rather unexpected.
Say, you sure left him in a fine position.
Have a cigarette, Tommy.
Thanks.
Look at him now.
Say, when are you gonna quit playing these cheap, childish tricks on me?
The day after you quit trying 'em on me.
Well, at least mine are funny and new!
Yeah, but mine work.
Oh, is that so?
Well, I've got one for you today, and I bet you'll fall for it before dinner.
For how much?
For a hundred dollars.
That's a bet.
Right.
Cheap cigarette trick.
Miss Cardwell to see you, sir.
To see me? - Yes, sir.
I don't know any Miss Cardwell.
She's waiting in the lobby, sir.
I wonder who this can be.
Look, look, look!
I had this made especially for him.
Now, we'll just leave it right there like that. Uh-uh, don't touch it!
This is going to cost him a hundred dollars.
This is the young lady, sir.
Thank you.
Are you Mr. Frost?
Yes.
My name is Patricia Cardwell. It's about the symphony orchestra.
They're all... - About what?
Didn't Mrs. Frost tell you?
Why, no.
Well... well, she told me that if I'd organize a symphony orchestra, she'd sponsor it and put it on your radio program.
Oh, you did.
Yes, I have all the musicians, a hundred men.
They're waiting for me now over in a garage on the East Side.
And now we need some money.
Money?
For what?
Well, first of all to pay the rent, and we also need it for...
Now, now, now, now, wait a minute, my child.
You mean to tell me that you have a symphony orchestra?
Yes, of course I have.
If you'll come with me right now, I'll show you.
Right now?
I wish you would.
You see, they must be getting awfully worried about the rent, and I have a taxicab right outside.
You have a ta...
Well now, that's just grand. And you have a big symphony orchestra.
Oh, I'm so glad you're interested, Mr. Frost.
I was so worried when I heard about Mrs. Frost going to Europe, - I thought maybe...
Now, my dear, I certainly am interested,
I'm always interested in hilarious ideas of this nature.
Let's go, then, come on!
No, no, no, no!
You see, I have some important business to attend to first.
Oh, but this is important too, Mr. Frost.
But I have to collect a hundred dollars.
Oh.
All right, I'll wait.
Oh no, no.
You run along and I'll follow you in my own car.
And you'll give us a contract and everything?
You can depend on me for everything you ask for.
All right. - Oh, here's the address.
Well now, that's not necessary, - I can find it.
Wait a minute, Mr. Frost, here it is! Just a minute. Here!
Turn north on 57th and First Avenue. And remember, we'll be waiting for you.
That's right, you just wait for me.
Thank you! Hello!
Amateur.
Funny and new, your jokes, huh?
That's the easiest hundred dollars I ever made in my life.
What?
Why, you hiring that child and trying to run me all the way across town.
You didn't expect me to fall for anything as stupid as that?
I got him, I got him!
Come on, gimme the hundred.
Was this the bet?
Yeah, that's it.
Well, what about that symphony girl?
What symphony girl?
Come on, quit stalling, give me the hundred.
But I thought...
Wait a minute.
You don't suppose that my wife did promise to sponsor a symphony orchestra of unemployed musicians?
Symphony orchestra?
What are you talking about?
Where's that slip of paper?
I've got to get down there and call this whole thing off!
What did she do?
Oh, my wife does the cutest things.
Boy! Get me my hat and coat.
Where's that little piece of paper?
Here it is, all right.
Hurry up with my coat!
Hey, what about my hundred dollars?
Never mind your hundred dollars!
You wait here.
Hey, wait a minute, not so fast there, how 'bout my dough-re-mi?
There's $6.20 on that clock.
Well, you'll get it from the sponsor.
The what?
The sponsor.
He's the man that pays all the bills.
Well, where do I find him?
Well, he'll be along in a minute or two.
But I don't know him!
Oh, but you could tell him.
He's, uh... and... oh, you can't miss him!
Sponsor. Now I'm waiting for a sponsor. I can wait.
I'm waiting for a sponsor to get my six-and-twenty.
And that, my child, is plenty, is ple-e-e-e...
That'll be $6.20. - What? - $6.20.
For what?
For cab fare. Oh.
Well, I didn't come in a cab, I came in my own car.
Yeah, but the little girl said to get it from the sponsor.
What makes you think I'm the sponsor?
Ain't you? Certainly not!
Certainly not.
Gentlemen, I want you all to meet Mr. John R. Frost, our benefactor.
Oh, this is my daddy, Mr. Frost.
I'm glad to meet you, Mr. Frost. It's a marvelous thing you're doing.
This is all very embarrassing to me, gentlemen, I...
Mr. Frost, you deserve much more. It's all we can do for you now, but later on, of course...
Now, see here Mister... what was your name?
Mr. Cardwell, there seems to be a slight misunderstanding here.
Misunder...
It is Mr. Frost, isn't it?
Yes, of course.
I'm Mr. Frost, but I'm sorry to say I am not your benefactor.
To be perfectly frank, I don't even know what is expected of me.
I want my money.
But Mr. Frost, you promised me that you'd sponsor my orchestra, and you said that you'd even put it on your radio hour.
Yes, did you tell her that?
Of course he did! Well now, I could take a child like this seriously, could I?
But Mr. Frost, you even promised me a contract! You even said that if I could only get an orchestra together...
Can't you keep your child out of this for a moment?
No, he can't!
We'll settle the whole matter like grownups.
But it was my idea and it was a grownup idea!
Patsy, will you please go over and sit down and let me handle this thing?
But, Daddy, he promised me!
Patsy, you go over and sit down, let me handle this, dear. - But, Daddy, he even offered me to co...
Patsy!
All right.
Now, we can get down to cases. - All right.
So, you actually thought that I would be interested in a crazy idea...
Crazy?
What do you mean?
You... - Patsy!
Yes, Daddy.
Now, Mr. Frost, this was your wife's idea.
She filled this child full of... we believed it.
Now, I'd rented this garage here, I got all these men together here...
That's a small matter... I'll take care of all your expenses up to date, - but gentlemen...
I want my money.
Who are you? - I...
I... I...
Mr. Frost, your wife started this...
I'd like to talk to her if I could.
You'd like to talk to her?
Yes.
Well, so would I...
There are a few things I'd like to say. - But, we can't, she's in Europe.
She's in Europe?
And get this straight:
I am not going to sponsor your orchestra on the air, on tour, or any place else.
Is that clear?
You don't have to shout, Mr. Frost. - I can hear you.
The whole thing is absurd!
Personally, I'm sorry that it happened.
Well, what about us?
What about these men?
A hundred of them, and you're sorry it happened?
Don't lose your temper, Mr. Cardwell.
I'm not losing my temper.
I just don't understand it.
It's quite simple.
Never at any time have I had any intention of engaging or sponsoring your... your band.
I'm a business man...
I can't afford to invest in a childish dream of this nature.
Why, gentlemen, I wouldn't stand a Chinaman's chance - to make any money with you.
But, they're all fine musicians, Mr. Frost.
That may be true, but who knows 'em?
You have no prestige, you have no name.
Mr. Cardwell here has no name... He's not a famous conductor.
I never claimed to be.
A hundred men playing music is not enough.
I don't care how good you are.
Unless you're known all over the world, you're a total loss to me.
You'll soon get to know us.
That's what they all say, but the people wouldn't even listen to ya.
Get something that'll make them listen!
A great singer, a famous conductor, I don't know what, but at least for one night, to establish yourselves as an orchestra, and then you've got something!
You're just looking for an excuse, Mr. Frost.
You know perfectly well that we can't get anybody with a reputation.
Well, that's none of my affair.
Oh, it isn't? Now, just a minute Mr. Frost...
Your wife promised my daughter
to sponsor this orchestra, didn't she?
Well, she was probably just trying to humor the child.
I suppose you were trying to humor her too when you promised her a contract.
This is all a joke... you see, I have a friend... - A joke?
Ugh!
Get out!
Get out!
We don't understand those kind of jokes around here, take them somewhere else!
Get out! You and your jokes!
I guess that's all, boys, let's go home.
Come on, Patsy.
Where is she?
She left.
She left?
Maybe she went home.
Oh... all right, pack up.
Well done.
It was good fun while it lasted.
We were happy for a few minutes, weren't we?
I want my money.
I...
What do you want?
Well, make yourself clear.
I need all of it now...
Oh, I was sure glad to meet you too.
You got your money, we got our contract, everybody's happy, it's a wonderful world.
Hey!
Hello.
How are you today?
Come here!
You can't go up there!
Come back here! Hey, you! - Excellent!
Er, where?
Let's play "Lohengrin I."
Excellent!
Oh, Mr. Stokowski, that was beautiful... It was wonderful.
Yes, but, how did you come in here?
Oh, I came straight through the, um, the...
Uh, around, uh...
Here.
Marshal?
Mr. Stokowski, I must talk to you about... It's about something very important, really, you must listen to me for just...
Just a minute, it's about...
Marshal?
Please, somebody call Marshal, will you?
Marshal!
Will you call?
Marshal!
Marshal!
Just a minute, Mr. Stokowski, I'll get him for you...
Marshal!
I'm coming!
Well, hurry up, Mr. Stokowski wants to see you.
Marshal, I've told you over and over again, no one can enter during rehearsal. - No one.
But, Mr. Stokowski, she sneaked in. - I... I didn't let her in.
Marshal, don't let it happen again now. - Show her out now, please.
Yes, sir... now, come on. Uh.
Mr. Stokowski, you've got to listen to me, please!
Get out of here. - Please!
Just a minute... let me go!
Please, you've got to listen to me, just... Let me go!
You get out of here!
Will you let me go... you don't have to push me!
I know the way, I've been thrown out of here before.
And so has my father!
You get out of here.
I'm getting awful sick and tired of throwing you two out.
Hello?
Hello? Shh.
Hello, what's wrong there?
Hello?
Hello? - This is Westing.
Who?
I said, "This is Westing," Ira Westing.
No, there's nobody here, but me. - Goodbye.
Wait a minute, wait... hold on there, hold on.
I want to find out if it's true that Mr. Stokowski is leaving this week on a European vacation.
Vacation?
He can't do that... He can't go on a vacation now.
He can't? Why not?
Well, he has much more important things to do.
Is that so? What are they?
Well, he has to conduct an orchestra, an orchestra of unemployed musicians.
Unemployed musicians?
That sounds very interesting.
I should say it is, and Mr. Frost is going to sponsor it.
John R. Frost?
Yes, Mr. John R. Frost.
Well, thank you, thank you very much.
Don't mention it, you're welcome... goodbye.
Have to hold a spot in the next edition for feature story:
Stokowski is going to conduct - an orchestra of unemployed musicians.
Really?
And oh, Tommy... send a box of candy up to that secretary in his office.
Yes, Mr. Westing.
What are you doing here?
Oh, uh, me? Oh, nothing, just...
Just waiting.
Waiting?
Who are you waiting for?
Mr. Stokowski.
Why?
Be... because he... he's told me to.
He wants to see me... he said he was busy, but he'd be through soon, and that if I'd wait, he'd see me, and I'm waiting.
Waiting.
This is a lovely office... Someone around here has... has excellent taste.
When did Mr. Stokowski tell you this? - Well, he didn't...
I can see it by the furniture, - and the rugs.
I mean, when did he tell you to wait?
Oh, well, I just saw him just now, just a minute ago.
You saw him during a rehearsal?
Well, of course, I waited until he was finished.
They played "Lohengrin"... oh, it was beautiful.
I like the brasses especially. What's a matter?
Don't you like "Lohengrin"?
That has nothing to do with what you're doing here.
Of course it hasn't, this is an entirely different matter.
What matter?
It's personal between Mr. Stokowski and me.
I don't believe it.
You'd better, it's true.
I'll find out if it's true or not in just a moment.
Well, you better not do that... he's rehearsing and he doesn't like to be disturbed
I know all about that too, - I happen to be his manager.
Oh, gentlemen, now we must rehearse Mozart. "Hallelujah," will you pass these back?
Oh, here are some more.
You want to speak to me?
I'm sorry to disturb you, but there's a young girl - in your room.
What, is she still here?
I told her to go home.
I see.
Now, oboes, you have a very important part here.
Hey, bud, you seen anything of a little girl around here?
With a feather in her hat?
Yeah, and a blue coat.
Yeah, I just threw her out of here.
Now, wait a minute.
I have been out there all the time, and she didn't come out, and if I don't find her, I'm gonna lose $7.90 cab fare.
If I don't find her, I'm gonna lose my job!
Here I am again. - So I see.
I'll take care of this young lady.
It's all right.
You have a remarkable voice.
Mr. Stokowski, I must talk to you...
About singing, I suppose?
Oh my goodness, no. - I didn't want to talk to you...
Oh, but you should, because you have - a real talent for singing.
Thank you.
Who taught you that music of Mozart?
My father. - Your father?
He must be a good musician.
Oh, yes, he is, and I have a hundred more just like him, a hundred fine musicians. - My orchestra. - Your orchestra?
So, you have an orchestra?
Yeah.
But, it's not as good as mine, is it?
Well, I personally think it's better.
So, did you hear that, gentlemen?
I told you in the rehearsal this morning, "We can't relax."
Mr. Stokowski, I wanted to ask you if... If you'd be kind enough to... To conduct my orchestra.
Oh, is that all you want?
Just for one night, that's all we'd need you...
But, you see, I have my own orchestra.
Yes, I know.
I know you don't think much of it. - Oh, but uh...
But, they're accustomed to me, and I think they're wonderful.
But, I understand that Mr. Stokowski, but if you'd just listen to my men just once,
You know, this child is wasting - our rather valuable time.
If you'd only give them just one audition...
Where are they playing now?
Well, right now they're playing in an old garage. If you'd just come...
Please, gentlemen.
Stop laughing!
It's not funny that some men are out of work and have to rehearse in a garage!
And it's very rude to laugh at people and their bad luck!
You oughta be ashamed of yourselves! All of you!
This has gone too far, you have to go.
Mr. Stokowski, please.
Everything depends upon you.
We have a sponsor, and he... He says if we could only get you, that...
Oh, please say yes, Mr. Stokowski, please.
I'd like to, but it's impossible.
I'm leaving for Europe after the next concert.
But... but, you can go on a vacation any time, and... it's much nicer in the summer anyway.
I promised to conduct in Europe, and I must keep those promises, but when I come back, we'll meet and talk it all over.
When will that be?
In about... six months.
Six months?
And... and you can't stay now?
I'm so sorry, but I can't.
I'm sorry too.
It would've meant so much to us.
Where do we go now, Miss?
What's a matter?
Anything wrong?
Oh, excuse me, I didn't understand you.
I was just saying, have you got some kind of trouble?
Oh oh, you oughta be the happiest kid in the world. Holy smoke, that voice of yours.
Why, when you swung up to that high C,
I couldn't have climbed out of my shoes trying to get up there with ya.
And when ya socked it up to the chandelier, and hung it there till you got ready to let it down... uh-uh.
It was a pip.
You know, I can see now why you didn't care much about my voice.
Compared to yours, I make noises that sound like a set of bad brakes on a hot day.
That was a nice song too... what's the name of it? - Hm? - The number you were chirpin' in there.
You know, the song.
Oh, Mozart's "Hallelujah" in F major. Mozart's "Hallelujah" in F major. Ha-ha... what's that mean in English?
Just Hallelujah.
Hallelujah, just plain old hallelujah.
Ah, you killed them with it though... You're going to be a great singer some day. - Think so?
Think so"?
You're a cinch!
And the dough you're gonna make, woo.
Maybe, but that'll be a long time from now.
Ah, what you need is patience.
Now, all the good things don't come in a minute.
Have you got patience?
Oh, plenty.
Could you wait years and years for something to happen that should happen right now?
Of course, if I had to, I could wait for...
Well, I'm afraid you'll have to, because...
Because I can't pay the cab fare right now.
Ya can't, eh?
No... you can arrest me if you want to. Take me to the police... go ahead.
I haven't got a penny!
What's the idea giving me the runaround sightseeing?
Where do you live? - Why?
I gotta take you home, don't I?
What about your money?
I'll worry about the money. You practice your singing... and don't forget
I got $8.40 invested in that voice already.
Where do ya live?
East 87th Street.
Hello, Patsy. - Hello, Daddy.
Where have you been?
Downtown.
All afternoon? I tried something, but it... didn't work. - Yes, I...
What did you try?
Aw, Patsy, what's the matter?
What is it, dear?
I went to see Mr. Stokowski, - but he won't conduct us.
Ooh, you shouldn't have done that.
But, I had to, Daddy... Mr. Frost said that if... Oh, it's useless, give it up, the whole idea.
Daddy, why does everybody laugh at me and make fun of me when I tell them about our orchestra?
'Cause they... they don't understand you, dear.
It would've made so many people happy.
You made them happy just trying to help.
I only wanted to see you have a job again.
You and Michael, and the others.
That's all I wanted! And to get you out of this... - This...
It's hopeless, dear, hopeless.
So you could have a fur collar on your coat, and turkey on your birthday. Instead of beans!
Patsy.
Patsy, listen to me.
You mustn't cry anymore.
It makes your daddy feel bad...
It makes me feel bad. - It makes you feel bad.
You are a good girl.
Suppose we all go down to the club?
Come on, Patsy, you wanna go?
Good, we'll play pinochle, and I'll appoint you my official Kibitzer.
How is that?
Have... have you got a handkerchief?
Sure.
It's in the laundry.
Here's mine, dear.
But, it was such a good idea.
Why couldn't it happen, Daddy?
Fairy tales never come true, darling.
Orchestra!
So then, he punched you in the nose, ah-ha-ha-ha-ha!
I'd have given $1,000 for a reserved seat at that fight. Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Could you imagine him tangling with a trombone player? This is the best laugh we've had since the Christmas
he fell on the ice playing Santa Clause.
Oh, be quiet, and have a drink.
Oh-ho, I can't.
I keep wondering what would happen if the bass drummer started to work on you.
I don't see anything funny about that.
Well, you'll pardon me if I do.
I don't see anything funny in that!
You'll pardon me if I do.
Now I'll smell like a barroom all night.
Is there anything strange about that?
This is an outrage! - What are they doing in Washington now?
It's these musicians...
I never told them anything like this.
They'll wish they never heard of me when I get through with them...
I'll sue this newspaper for every cent they've got.
Me sponsor that orchestra... They must think I'm crazy. - They can't use my name to put the thing over.
Now, don't get excited.
I'm gonna call my lawyer... - Wait a minute, don't be in a hurry
to call your lawyer.
Will you let me alone and keep out of this? - I'm sore, good and sore.
Why, this orchestra isn't such a bad idea. You think so?
Well, you can have my part of it, if you think it's so great.
Can I?
Thanks, old man.
Now, wait a minute, I want that deal.
You're too late... John gave it to me.
Oh yeah?
Well, why do you suppose I stopped him from calling his lawyer for?
What is Stokowski's number?
Stop it!
John gave it to me.
Oh, you're very clever, aren't you? - Clever enough to know a good idea
when I see it.
You mean clever enough to steal it? Steal it?
Well, John doesn't want it, but I can use it.
What is Stokowski's number?
Sure, anybody can use $2 million worth of publicity... why, this story will be in every paper in the country by tomorrow.
And that's why you want it.
Why, I just wanted to help the poor musicians. Really?
Since when have you become a philanthropist?
What you need is a new radio program.
And what about you?
What's Stokowski's number?
Oh, stop it.
Well, you boys must think that thing's pretty good. - Well, any fool would know that!
Well, if properly handled,
a man could make a national reputation with it.
And that's just what you want to do.
Why, you'd give your right arm to be called in the White House, and take all the bows as a public, spirited citizen.
And I suppose you wouldn't...
What's Stokowski's number? - I don't know.
Let me have it, I'll find it!
I'll find it myself.
Let me get information here, she'd know all about it... hello, Information.
Let me have Mr. Stokowski's number.
Yes, S-K... no, S-K-W...
Oh, you don't even know how to spell it.
Of course I do! - S-K-W... F-F.
Leopold, Leopold.
Oh, nevermind!
Let me have the Manhattan Concert Hall instead.
Please tell Mr. Frost we know nothing at all about it.
Mr. Stokowski never said he'd conduct that orchestra.
He doesn't even know what kind of musicians they are. He didn't, eh?
Well, it was in the newspaper.
Oh yes, we are giving a statement to the press for the morning paper denying the whole story.
Yes, the maestro is very upset about it, goodbye. - Did you hear it?
Yes.
The whole thing's a fake, John...
Oh, where is John? John? - Oh, John, poor John!
Oh, where's Mr. Frost, Stevens?
He just left, sir.
Have you read this?
Stokowski's going to conduct us!
It's right here in the papers.
How did this get in the paper?
What... what do you mean?
Why, do you wanna read this? - Look at that.
Right on the headlines. - What's that?
What do you know about this, John? - Have you seen it? - Does that mean us?
I don't know.
Well, it says, "Unemployed orchestra."
Let me see it.
Hey!
Well, who put that in the paper? - Stokowski, I guess.
Does this mean we got a job?
Patsy, you saw Stokowski this afternoon.
Wait a minute! No, wait a minute!
Did he say he'd conduct us?
No, he didn't.
But, you did see him, didn't you?
Yes, but then...
Well, what did he say?
Well, he said he couldn't do it, he's too busy, he has to go to Europe...
Well, maybe he changed his mind.
No, I don't think that, he...
He wasn't even interested when I saw him this afternoon. - Maybe Mr. Frost did it.
I don't think so, we had quite an argument
and I punched him in the face. - Oh.
But, how did this get into the paper? - Oh, I don't know, if Mr. Frost...
Well, there's one sure way to find out,
and that's to call up the editor. - Right, Dad!
Oh, have you got a nickel?
I've got one.
Well, hurry up.
Where is it? Where is it?
Here it is. - Thank you.
Come on, I wanna listen to him.
Daily Express.
Can I speak to the, um, the... - The editor.
The editor, please.
It's about that Stokowski story. - You want the music editor,
just a moment, please. - Just a moment, I'll try again. - Go ahead.
Is this the music editor?
Well, this is Ms. Patricia Cardwell, I'd like to know who put that in the paper.
The story about the unemployed musicians.
Well, that story came right from Stokowski.
No, I didn't see him, but I talked to his office on the phone about four o'clock, why?
Because I can't believe it.
You can believe it all right.
If you see it in the Express, it's true. - Thank you.
Well, what is it?
Well, what'd he say?
He said the message came
straight from Mr. Stokowski's office. - Then it is true?
Oh, Patsy, you put it over!
Wait a minute, wait a minute, let me think.
You hit Mr. Frost in the face, so... So he couldn't have done it.
But, you found out with my nickel, that's...
Please, Michael, I'm trying to think. - All right, all right.
Mr. Stokowski said, "No."
But, he changed his mind!
Well, maybe he did, now wait a minute.
The message came directly from Mr. Stokowski's office.
Now, who on earth could've put that in the...
Well, what's the matter, Patsy? - I...
Hey, where's that tough trombone player?
I wanna see you.
But, wait a minute, you don't understand...
Don't go away. - I believe I owe you...
You don't owe me anything!
But, the members of my orchestra...
I don't care anything about your orchestra.
I don't like you, and I don't like them, and I don't like the music they play.
The only reason that I am here is to give you this $1,000 to bind the contract, that clear?
No... I don't understand.
What's the difference?
I don't either, but everybody says it's a swell idea...
If it is, it's mine. - Here, sign this receipt.
Wait a minute!
Daddy, Daddy, please listen to me, you can't take that money. - What?
Are you in here again?
Listen. - But...
Can't you keep your child out of this?
I'm talking to my father now, can you please... - Patsy, later, dear.
But, just a minute, let me talk...
Will you please leave us alone? - Patsy, sit down.
But, Daddy, please, just one minute.
It's a contract for three months...
Will you be quiet?
But, even so, Mr. Frost, you don't understand, he... he...
All right, then I'll make it six months, now sign that receipt.
Six months? No, Daddy, you can't do it.
Please listen to me, just one minute, please...
See here, young lady.
This is a holdup, and I'll make it for one year, now will you be quiet? - No, he can't...
Patsy, sit down.
Please listen to me, Daddy, just...
Stop, dear.
If you can't keep your child out of this, the whole deal is off. - Patsy, sit down.
Patsy!
Just one minute, Daddy, please!
All right, but don't say I didn't tell ya.
I've never seen such a child in all my life. - That...
Shh, you'll spoil everything.
But... but, my... - There you are, Mr. Frost.
All right, and here's your check.
Now, we'll meet tomorrow morning in my office to sign the contracts... now remember, you're all under contract to me...
If anybody comes snooping around here, - throw 'em out!
We certainly will.
Now, I'll go over and straighten this fellow Stokowski out. - Goodnight.
Goodnight, Mr. Frost.
Goodbye!
Thank you!
No, don't thank me... Thank that little girl over there.
She's got more business ability than all of you put together.
The little brat.
Three cheers for Patsy! Hip-hip. - Hooray!
Hip-hip. - Hooray!
Yeah!
Please wait a minute!
Quiet, everybody.
Say something, Patsy, make a speech.
All right, Daddy... we haven't got Stokowski.
But, darling, you talked to the newspaper yourself!
That's what I mean:
I put the story in the paper...
Mr. Stokowski doesn't know anything about it.
I didn't mean to, Daddy...
I was in Mr. Stokowski's office all alone, and someone called up on the phone... I thought I was telling it to one man, I...
I didn't know I was telling it to a whole newspaper.
I didn't mean to, Daddy, honestly.
The same old bologna.
I knew that. - Why didn't you tell us
before we accepted the money? - Why didn't I...
How do you like it?
What do you think I've been trying to do all time?
Well... what's going to happen now?
Well, we've got the money, we've got a sponsor, we've got a contract. - All we ain't got is Stokowski.
Patsy, you've got to see him.
I can't, Michael, he won't have anything to do with our orchestra.
We can try again! - He'd only say no, I talked to him,
he's going away. - What if you told him how everything...
It's hopeless, Daddy.
Patsy, you've got to see him.
It's our only chance...
If you give up, we'll all have to give up.
It's not true... this whole situation is ridiculous.
There wasn't anything ridiculous about the $1,000 I gave those musicians with the understanding that you were to conduct them.
Yes, but you were misinformed... I'm not free to conduct them.
What about that story in the newspaper? - Where'd that come from?
Not from me.
Well then, from who?
All I can think is someone deliberately meant to cause trouble and embarrassment.
Well, that's not probable. Who'd wanna cause me any...
Wait a minute... why, that snake in the grass!
That halfwit! - What's that?
Oh, you don't understand, but I do...
First, a puttied billiard ball, and now, an orchestra.
Why, I'll take this $1,000 out of his hide.
Where is my coat and hat?
You know what else I am going to do to Mr. Bitters?
I'm gonna make him eat that newspaper, every page of it, and I'm going to feed it to him myself.
And that's not all... I'm gonna sue him!
And if you don't sue him, I'll sue you for not suing him!
Where is my hat and coat?
That's carrying a joke a little bit too far.
I'll make him pay for this if it takes the last nickel I've got, - and I've got a few nickels.
Yes, sir.
When you see the paper in the morning, you'll see a different story.
Yes, sir?
From now on, don't answer the bell, and disconnect the telephone.
I've had a very hard day today... I don't want to see anyone or hear from anyone. - No, sir.
I'm going to work late tonight,
so don't disturb me for anything. - Very good, sir.
I'll see that no one bothers you again tonight, sir.
Come on in... hurry, hurry up. - Come on... shh.
Everything all right? - Everything all right?
Did you see him?
Yes, but I couldn't talk to him.
Where is he?
He's up there, can't you hear him?
Is that him playing? - Yes.
We'll all be arrested for this!
Sh, the butler will hear you...
He's right in that room.
Is he a big fellow?
Oh, he's about... about so big.
So big?
I'll take care of him.
Give me your belt, give me your belt.
Good evening, Mr. Stokowski.
How did you manage to come in here?
Oh, uh... well, I just...
How do you get into places where you should not be?
Well, I don't know, my daddy says it's a gift. I am sorry, but you must leave now.
Mr. Stokowski, it's about that newspaper story.
I know who gave it to them. - You know?
Yes...
I did.
You did?
Do you realize how much trouble you've given me?
Oh, I didn't mean to, really... you see, what really happened... Yes, but why did you do it?
You must've had a reason.
Oh yes, I had a reason...
I had a hundred reasons. - Would you like to hear them?
I certainly would.
Really?
Yes.
All right.
One, two, three, four!
What's that?
Those are my reasons.
You wanted to hear them, didn't you?
Well, there they are.
But, please, just a...
Well, what do you think of my orchestra now?
Oh, I'm not interested in your orchestra.
I'm trying to get a good look at the guy that socked you.
Which one is it?
The trombonist with the curled-up mustache.
May we present to you the one who made all this possible, who has brought so much happiness to this orchestra, and to me, and we hope to you.
Ms. Patricia Cardwell.
Now, you say a few words to them... Just speak to them, that's right.
Yes, you.
Yes, that's right.
Ladies and gentlemen, uh... - I, uh... - Yes, all right, go on.
You see, this orchestra...
How about singin', Patsy?
All right! - May we, Mr. Stokowski?
Which one will you sing?
Um, "Traviata." - "Traviata."
Traviata.
My dear lady, each day, for the last couple of months... this policeman is a walking right past my fruit stand.
Then, he's a turn around... he's a take the apple and...
And, when I tell him to leave my apples alone... he's a telling me "chase himself".
So, I think to myself I will have him put in the jail... for stealing the apple.
But... this idea is no good, because all the policemen have a union.
One cop is not going to arrest another one.
Public Defender's office. Yes.
Miss Graham? I'll tell him.
Thank you so much for the flowers, they're lovely.
Just a minute.
Thanks.
Goodbye and thank you again.
Miss, I have come here to have your boss to sue this cop... for stealing my apples.
Yes, Mr. Whitney?
Can you spare a moment, Joan?
I beg your pardon, I'll be right back.
When you've finished, send it to the DA's office.
I don't believe it.
The Public Defender and the District Attorney holding hands.
It isn't possible.
We were just discussing the Foley girl.
Why don't you let her off? I believe her story.
So Steve's been telling me.
I've decided not to prosecute.
You won't regret it. She was just a victim of circumstances.
You're a better attorney than either of us. Steve, I'll make a trade.
My secretary and dinner at Pierre's for Joan.
No, I'll stick with Stephen. You put them in and he gets them out.
Much more interesting.
More interesting, maybe, but not practical.
Is she still in love with this fellow Taylor?
Strange, isn't it? What does she see in him?
How should I know?
Sorry.
Well, so long.
And he is a cheap crook.
My offer stands.
Will you put that in writing?
You know something?
Your claim doesn't belong here but in the court of small claims.
Small claims?
My dear lady, do you think that three apples each day for one month is...?
Is 1095 apples a year.
For 5 years, is 5975 apples.
Pardon me, old man.
I'll leave straight from court and meet you up there.
I can't begin to tell you how marvellous you've been.
I'm going to miss you these two weeks.
The new girl's rather pretty. I hope I have my job when I get back.
If that's your only worry...
Wait a minute, are you the Public Offender?
People have called me that.
You better be getting started.
See? Everyone is running around like a head with his chicken cut off.
I am a citizen and I pay my taxes.
If I don't get satisfaction from somebody in this building... is going to be one policeman less in this united nation.
Good morning.
Thanks, Pat.
I thought I was the only crazy one in the family.
But you, you're absolutely wacky.
I love being wacky.
Oh, go ahead. Ruin your life, throw it away on a worthless gorilla.
End up at my age with no future. What do you think people will say?
That I'm crazy, that I'll be sorry and other things that don't matter.
You'll find out they do matter.
Come on, Bonnie, be a good sport, wish us happiness.
I do, darling, but you haven't a Chinaman's chance.
It's almost 12, I have to hurry.
What about lunch? Haven't time.
It'd be awful to keep Eddie waiting.
Awful, you're right, it's awful.
You won't keep him waiting 10 minutes and he kept you waiting 3 years.
You're leaving with a better chance than most prisoners I release.
You have intelligence beyond that of the average criminal.
Thanks, warden.
Directed on the right path, that intelligence can re-establish you.
In the wrong, you'll be right back here again.
I'm going to fool you this time.
I hope so.
Conditions have changes since I last made this speech to you.
You've been my guest three times.
The first, for stealing an auto for a joyride.
The next, for grand larceny.
This visit, which terminates today... due to the efforts of Mr. Whitney, was for driving the getaway car... for the toughest mob of bank bandits in this country.
You're a three-time loser.
A fourth conviction, according to the law... means a life sentence.
Don't worry, I'm checking out of this hotel for keeps.
I've got a job for him, he'll make good.
I will, if they let me.
It's up to you.
Goodbye and good luck, Taylor.
Goodbye, warden.
Hello, general.
Bye, Bugsy.
The old cell won't seem like home without you.
Here's your socks, I washed them for you.
Thanks. keep them. Thanks.
Don't forget what I told you about dames.
Lay off them, tempt you like a fruit cake.
Remember to send me a picture of that movie star.
You know the one.
With the big blue eyes.
So long.
So long.
I'll be seeing you.
Not if I can help it.
What's he in for?
Life. Carved up an acrobat he found hanging around his wife.
He's harmless. He's been here so long he's like one of the warden's family.
I'll look you up when I get out.
Don't do me any favours, Monk.
Lay off the high hat, Taylor. You're still one of the boys.
Out.
Scram.
Play ball.
Strike one.
Four.
Take your base.
Mike.
Yes, father?
Call them, Mike. Yes, father.
And call them honest.
I'm always honest.
Eddie.
You weren't leaving without saying goodbye, were you?
Hi, Mr. Whitney.
Father Dolan, we need another ball!
You don't seem happy for a man the gates are about to open for.
What do you want me to do?
Cheer? There's many a man in here that would.
I cheered the first time I got out. They rammed it back down my throat.
They're not all like you on the outside.
If they were, these places would be haunted houses.
You're a grand fellow, one of these days you'll find that out.
Thanks, father, that's something.
Joan!
Eddie!
Joan, darling. You're here, you're here.
Darling, sweet.
Sweetheart.
Shake it up, Taylor.
You want to get out, don't you?
Eddie, let me get my breath.
I can't keep my hands off you.
You thought I wouldn't be here.
I was afraid even to ask Whitney.
My letters, didn't you believe them?
I do now.
Are you cute!
Come on, let's get away from here.
Thanks again, Stephen.
And you too, father. You both know how I feel.
That goes for me too.
Most lawyers are just agents, but you're not.
Thanks for lining up the job, too.
That's alright.
Goodbye.
Goodbye, and good luck.
It was a great thing you did, getting him out for her.
You won't regret it.
There's a lot more good in Taylor than most people think.
I hope you're right, but I think she's made a mistake.
It's only natural you'd think that, feeling the way you do about her.
Father, what is it she feels for him?
Is it love?
Pity?
I've a faint suspicion it's more than pity.
What a nest for a honeymoon.
How did you find it?
I spent 3 years looking for it.
3 years.
You know, Esther?
I've seen that fella's face somewhere before. And I don't like it.
If you attended your chores instead of reading detective periodicals... you wouldn't be so suspicious of everybody.
I'm right to be suspicious. When he asked me for a room...
I said "What's your name?". I looked him right in the eye.
His woman gave ma a funny look.
I'll be hog tied if I ain't seen his face in one of them magazines.
Well, find it, or I'll burn that trash first thing in the morning.
Burn them?
Burn them?
I'll find it... if I have to sit up all night.
Listen. They sound just like crooners, don't they?
Crooners.
When I was a kid we used to catch them in the sewer drains.
Some of the kids would pull off their legs and fry them in bonfires.
Used to make me sick.
I got my first rap protecting a frog's life.
I beat up a kid for doing that, his mother sent me to reform school.
There's another one.
Come on.
You know something about frogs?
If one dies, the other dies. That's funny.
Why?
I don't know, except they can't live without each other.
Like Romeo and Juliet?
No kidding, that's how they are. How do you know so much about frogs?
I thought everybody knew that.
I guess they see something in each other that no one else can see.
Maybe.
Eddie, what made you fall in love with me?
Me with you?
What made you go for a mug like me?
When I fell in love at the dance, I didn't know you were a mug.
I told you I was a phoney and a bad guy to get stuck on.
I didn't believe you until you asked Stephen to defend you for robbery.
I'll never forget how you slapped my face and ran out crying.
I hated you so much, I cried for 3 days and 3 nights.
Why did you come to the prison to see me?
To tell you how much I hated you.
Only I got mixed up and told you how much I loved you.
Are you still mixed up?
What do you think?
You're one in a million.
Careful, Ethan, he may be dangerous.
I ain't afraid of that.
When I'm around, I'm... I'm around.
No jailbird is going to spend the night in Valley Tavern.
Well, if you're gonna do it, do it.
Hold your shirt on, I'll do it.
We better wait until morning.
Yes?
Well, Mr. Taylor... my wife wants to tell you something.
Go ahead, Esther. Tell him yourself.
Well, Mr. Taylor... you see, this room was reserved... some folks from Battleboro.
Convicts and their wives ain't welcome in this tavern.
So we're asking you, in a nice way, to leave at once.
Okay.
Good night.
Good night.
Did you hear what they said?
Darling, you promised you wouldn't let things like this bother you.
I'm thinking of you.
I told you something like this would happen.
What do we care about these people? What do we care about anybody...?
Yes?
Yes, we're leaving just as soon as we're packed.
And to think I spent 3 long years looking for this place.
Has 37 reported in yet?
No.
How can I keep up a schedule if you can't keep track of the drivers?
Don't pick on me for that jailbird being late.
I didn't hire him.
Never mind that.
Check the gas station.
I think it's the swellest place I've ever seen.
It's a dump.
It's not.
It's terrific.
Anyway, no one can throw us out at four o'clock in the morning.
You've come a long way, I knew you would.
You're the only one who did.
What about Stephen, the people you work for, and Father Dolan?
They don't count, what they did was because of you.
Ajax gave me a job because of Whitney.
Father Dolan...
He's for everybody.
Let's be practical, what about it? It's a big responsibility.
I'm not going to be a truck driver all my life.
Besides, this home owner racket lets you pay off for nothing a week.
In 20 years, it's yours. Look.
Here's a receipt for the deposit I made.
Do I give them the rest or don't I?
Of course you do.
It's a swell place for kids.
What are you laughing about?
Nothing.
There's your bus.
See you Saturday. Yes, darling.
Light, 5 dollars.
Water, 3 dollars.
Gas...
Taylor, call your office.
Fill her up.
Truck 37 reporting. Yes, Mr. Williams.
Taylor, you're an hour and 35 minutes late.
I know, Mr. Williams, I'm sorry, but...
I don't want to listen to lies about running out of gas or blowing a tyre.
Wait, Mr. Williams.
Don't accuse me until you hear what I have to say.
I don't want to hear what you've got to say.
You're fired. Fired?
You can't fire me just like this.
I can't?
Listen, jailbird, leave that truck there and don't take anything... or I'll put you back in the pen where you belong.
No ex-con is gonna jazz up a schedule for me.
You're fired, finished, canned.
Get it?
Yeah, I get it. Ex-con.
Okay, I'll get another job.
20 gallons.
Let the guy who's gonna drive sign for it. I got fired.
What am I gonna do with this truck?
That's your worry, not mine.
Taylor.
Some dame's calling you, long distance.
I'll be over at Tony's.
Hello?
Gee, I'm glad you called.
What?
You're phoning from the new house?
I moved in this morning.
He's so surprised, he can hardly talk.
If only he'd stay that way...
Eddie?
Eddie?
I can't hear you.
I'm just excited that you've moved in already, that's all.
He's tickled pink.
He'll be hysterical when he finds out I'm not going to live here with you. What's that?
What? The real estate man?
Don't worry.
He said it was alright for me to move in.
As long as you give him the rest by next week.
You can make it? The payment?
Sure, I wasn't even thinking about it.
The housewarming?
Sure. Sure we'll have one.
I can't wait to see the place.
Don't you dare show up before Saturday, I'll have everything fixed.
Don't forget to tell him the sink leaks.
Eddie, Bonnie says the sink leaks.
We'll go into that later.
This long distance stuff costs plenty.
Sure I'm happy.
Don't worry. It's in the bag.
Goodbye, babe, I'll see you Saturday.
I know I was wrong, Mr. Williams, and I'm sorry.
Please give me another chance.
You don't realise what it means if you don't give me my job back.
Hello?
Yes, May.
Yes, I'll be home for dinner.
Sorry, I can't do anything for you.
Why don't you invite the Murphys? We'll play a little poker.
Okay. It's no use, Taylor.
You've got to help me, Mr. Williams.
My wife's moved in already.
I can't let her down, she believes in me.
I've tried to get a job everyplace.
The only people who'll give me one are my old gang.
Easy money too, Mr. Williams.
But I turned them down, I'm trying to go straight.
Hello? Yes, May.
Have the O'Donnell's over, they play poker.
Just a minute, dear.
If you don't mind, I'd like to speak to my wife.
Won't you even give me a recommendation? No.
How can I?
Nobody will talk to me without one. Hold the line a minute, honey.
Listen.
I'm not running a reform school...
I'm running a business, and I can't waste any more time on you. Get out.
And I wanted to go straight...
Open up.
Hold it. Wait there, please.
Nice day for it. - I'll say so.
This is some weather.
Just a minute, please.
Get back.
Eddie.
Any cops been around here? Cops, why?
What are you doing with that gun?
Please, tell me what's the matter.
The bottom has dropped out of everything.
Darling, what's happened?
Read this.
What's this got to do with you?
It's my hat, look at the initials.
Your hat?
But, how could it be?
It is.
Somebody stole it when I was in Tony's Beanery... they planted it to take the heat off themselves and put it on me.
You believe me, Joan, don't you?
I do, Eddie, I do.
I took a chance on being blasted, just to hear you say that.
I've got to make a run for it, give me the keys to your car.
But, you didn't do it.
Give me them, I've got to go.
You can't, there must be some other way.
Do you want me to burn for a job I didn't do?
Aren't you going to help me?
Eddie, you can't run.
You'll never be able to prove your innocence then.
What do you want me to do?
Give myself up?
Yes.
Are you crazy?
It's sensible.
Anything else will make you look guilty. I'm a three-time loser.
They're looking for a goose to cook, I'm it.
You think they'll believe I was out looking for a job?
If you love me, stay here and face this.
If I do, it means the chair.
You're looking at it wrong.
You're innocent, you don't have to run away.
Try to make a jury believe that, or anyone.
You can prove it, if you stay. Run away, you'll never get a chance.
You must believe me.
Okay, kid. We'll play it your way.
But, you're gambling with my life and if you...
I'm not wrong, I know it.
Stick 'em up, Taylor, or you're a dead man.
Don't, Eddie.
Let him.
Save the State the expense of a trial. Don't shoot.
He's giving himself up.
Think that jury will bring in a verdict before our deadline?
That verdict is our deadline.
Eddie. Please, forgive me.
Please, forgive me.
Let's go.
Go ahead! Take a good look!
Monkeys!
Have a good time!
Get a big kick out of it!
It's fun to see an innocent man die, isn't it?
If you think I'll go to the chair, you're crazy.
They're never gonna kill me for a job I didn't do.
Never. Never.
I'm innocent.
I didn't do it.
That's what they all say, till the switch is thrown.
No, certainly I'm not giving up the case.
I won't take the word of a jury who convicted a man purely on his record. I'm not that dumb.
Goodbye.
You're not helping Joan by keeping this case alive.
I think I am.
Stop acting like a 1936 Abraham Lincoln and get some sense.
Eddie's been pounding on the door of an execution chamber since birth.
Neither you nor anyone will keep him from opening it. What do you suggest I do?
Let him die, without a fight?
Yes.
The sooner he does, the sooner Joan will come to her senses.
Stephen. You forget, Joan's going to be a mother.
I'm not forgetting anything. If he dies, it'll just about kill Joan too.
I'm not going to give up.
He'll be on the other side of this glass. You talk through these holes.
You mean well, father, but I won't see her.
Eddie, open your eyes, stop walking in the dark.
I tell you, I won't see her. Leave me alone.
She's fighting for you every minute. There's nothing she wouldn't do to help you.
Believe me, nothing.
Okay, father. Okay.
I'll see her.
Thanks for seeing me. I'd have died if you hadn't.
Say something. Speak to me, please.
I'm going crazy, thinking of you, here... night after night, days alone.
No matter how much you hate me, I hate myself more for what's happened.
I love you, I'll always love you.
Then why don't you do something about it?
What can I do?
Tell me, I'll do anything in the world.
Put your head closer.
Get me a gun. A gun. Get me a gun.
A gun? Day after tomorrow, they let you see me for the last time.
You can slip it to me then.
I can't, I can't.
You'll kill somebody.
What do you think they're going to do to me?
Eddie. Eddie.
He's gone, Mrs. Taylor.
Governor refuses stay!
Taylor dies tomorrow!
Read all about it!
Extra! Taylor dies tomorrow!
Read all about it!
Governor refuses stay!
Extra! Taylor dies tomorrow!
Read all about it!
Taylor dies tomorrow! Extra! Extra!
Taylor dies tomorrow!
Will I see him in his cell? Yes, my dear.
Joan, it's going to take a lot of courage to say goodbye.
You'll have to be a good soldier.
Hello, father. Hello, Dan.
All right.
Don't be afraid, we just passed the electric eye which detects metal.
You'll have to come with us to be searched. I?
I'm the culprit, boys.
I shoulďve left my pocket knife in my room. - Well, you see...
You're not packing a machine gun?
It was thoughtless of me, we'll be right back.
Okay, father.
Come on, Joan.
Give me that gun. But...
Give me that gun.
Now, let's go to him.
Father, I can't disappoint him again.
When they take him, will you be with him?
I'll be by his side until the end.
Just before the end, not before... tell him I haven't forgotten about the frogs.
He'll know what I mean.
Fine world. First, they kill the chicken, Taylor eats the chicken.
Then, they kill Taylor.
If I wasn't crazy, I'd worry about that.
Rogers.
I want to see my wife.
Too late now, it's against the rules.
Would you do one favour for me?
Anything that ain't against the rules.
Tell her that I love her... that I'm sorry I acted like such a heel.
Tell her that, Rogers. That's not against the rules.
Tommy.
Chicken.
I know it's chicken.
Look at this.
I'm not hungry.
Well, drink your coffee anyway.
It's good for you.
I don't want it.
Boy, it's going to be foggy out tonight.
Smell that grub. We've got a new cook.
A guy who poisoned three of his customers.
It was a great break for us.
Put it down and get out.
You don't like your food, huh?
Call the hospital, hurry!
You can't do it this way, you've got to walk to the chair.
Hello? Give me the hospital, quick.
Alright, bring him to the hospital, immediately.
Prepare for a transfusion.
Will it be necessary to postpone the execution?
What time is it now?
Five-thirty.
Get me Dr. Hill.
Yes, sir.
Doctor, it's the Warden.
Yes, Warden?
He's weak, but he'll be strong enough by then.
I'll keep him here, where we can watch him, until the time comes.
Thanks, Doctor. The execution will go on as scheduled, at 11 pm.
You saved his life, Rogers. Is there anything else I can do for you?
Sit on my lap when they throw the switch.
Put him on ward nine. - Yes, sir.
Rats! You're not gonna burn me!
You're just begging for the isolation cell, aren't you? What do I care?
Alright boys, put him in.
No reason why the others should be disturbed.
There's still time for the governor to grant a reprieve.
No.
It's too late now.
Tommy, let's have a look at him.
Yes, sir.
Stick 'em up, all of you.
Back up.
And no noise.
Slide over and face the wall.
Hurry up.
Doctor, put your hands down and start walking naturally.
You can't get away with this.
Shut up.
I'll tell you when to talk.
One peep out of you two and I'll let the Doc have it. Get out.
Stop.
We all look at life through the same eyes but we don't see the same thing.
I still can't understand your feeling for the Taylor boy.
I think he was born bad.
Dr. Hill is late again.
Mrs. Wheeler, I can't agree with you.
Every man, at birth, is endowed with the nobility of a king.
The stain of the world soon makes him forget even his own birthright.
Perhaps that's why they invented death... to give us another chance to remember who we are before we're born again.
I hope when Taylor dies tonight, he won't be born again.
He's caused enough trouble in this world.
Hello?
What?
Okay, inform the guards to shoot to kill.
I'll be over in a second. Further instructions over the loudspeaker.
What's happened?
Taylor's broken out of the hospital.
He has a gun. He's using Dr. Hill for a shield.
They're hiding in the fog.
I'll go with you.
Alright, father.
Please, be careful.
Jason speaking.
Turn off the sirens, I'm going to use the loudspeaker.
Turn that light over here.
All guards. All guards. Warden speaking.
Get Taylor and shoot to kill. Get Taylor and shoot to kill.
But save Dr. Hill, if possible. Save Dr. Hill, if possible.
The warden doesn't want to see you die. You must owe him money.
But, you're gonna die if we get to the gate and they don't open it.
Stand still.
Can anybody hear me?
Yeah, I can hear you.
What have you got to say?
Tell the warden I want to talk to him.
To come to the truck gate or I'll let the doctor have it.
Okay, Taylor.
Take it easy.
Get going, to the truck gate.
I'll be right over.
I'll go with you. Stay here, this is my job.
keep moving.
I'll do anything, but don't kill me.
Shut up.
You'll get a chance to talk for your life.
Get going.
Taylor! Stop.
This is the warden.
I'm at the gate.
Open it up, or I croak Hill!
Taylor, shooting Hill won't open that gate.
Every man in the service of this prison takes that chance.
Dr. Hill will have to take his.
We'll see about that! Now, you can do your talking.
Warden, open the gates.
He'll kill me.
Warden!
Father, where's the warden?
On the bridge. What's happened?
Pardon for Taylor.
Warden! Open the gate! He'll kill me!
You can't let me die like this! Let him out!
Don't you hear me?
If you don't open the gate, he'll kill me.
Pardon from Washington, for Taylor.
Open it up, warden, or I croak Hill.
You've been pardoned, Taylor!
Put down your gun! Who do you think you're kidding?
It's the truth, let the doctor go and come to my office.
Quit stalling and open up, or Hill gets it.
You're a free man, Taylor. Put down your gun.
They're getting yellow. Now watch that gate open.
I'm giving you till 20 to make up your mind!
One, two... three, four...
Warden, please, he'll kill me.
Five... six, seven...
Open it.
Wait a minute. Hold it.
You can't let him out with a gun in his hand.
He'll stop the first car that comes and kill the driver.
He'll kill anybody that gets in his way. Let me talk to him.
He'll believe me. He's always believed me.
Give me the message, please.
Alright, father.
Try it.
I'll let you know when to open the gate.
Eighteen... nineteen...
Don't shoot.
Don't shoot. I don't want to die.
Neither do I, but I'll kill you and anyone else who gets in my way...
Surely you wouldn't kill me, Eddie?
Put down that gun.
Stay out of this, father.
You're a free man. Put down the gun and read this.
So, you're in on it too.
You want me to burn like the rest of them.
Read this. You're a free man. It's the truth.
Stay where you are, don't come any closer.
Eddie, give me that gun.
If you don't, I can't open the gate... they won't open, unless I give the order.
Stay where you are!
Eddie, won't you believe me?
I don't believe anybody! Then I can't open the gate.
So you are in on it!
Read this.
Stay where you are!
Hold your fire! I'm not hit!
Tell them to open the gates or Hill gets it.
Please, father, I've got a family.
Open the gate, warden.
Open it. Yes, sir.
Get going.
I got the whole thing over the wire from the switch tower operator.
On the siding across from the pen. - I guess Taylor just went crazy.
I don't understand why he wouldn't believe the priest. You'd think he'd have believed him.
I know a guy who shot his own dog, right through the heart.
What's that got to do with a guy killing a priest?
Nothing. I just happened to think of it.
Imagine when he finds out he was free and he killed a priest for nothing.
Hello? Eddie?
Eddie? Joan?
Eddie.
Bonnie.
Eddie?
I'm out.
Eddie.
Take this number. X, 7, 9... 3, 6, 2, 1.
It's the number of the boxcar in the BLW freight yards.
Come to me.
Joan, please, don't go.
Eddie hasn't a chance, they'll get him before morning.
Then I'll be with him, but they'll have to find us first. - Joan.
Wait.
Let me go.
Here's money. Take my car, it's faster.
Thanks.
Eddie?
Joan.
Eddie!
Eddie.
Joan, you're here.
Darling, you're hurt?
I'm all washed up.
They got me after I broke out.
Joan, I killed Father Dolan.
You killed Father Dolan?
He was trying to tell me I was pardoned.
I didn't believe him.
They made me a murderer. No, darling.
I can't beat this rap.
I wanted to kiss you once before they get me.
Come on, we've got to get out of here.
I'll never let them take you back.
I don't care what you've done.
If I knew where he was, I'd tell you.
I'd like to see him in the chair too.
I love my sister and I want her back.
Why don't you go out and find him instead of wasting your time on me?
You sound as though you sympathise with Taylor.
Why not? The law condemned him to death. They made a mistake and thought they could straighten it out like that.
You can't take a man who has been in the death house for five months... waiting, waiting, and straighten out his mind just like that.
What's more, if I were called upon to defend Taylor again, I'd do it.
You're not being very helpful.
What do you expect me to do?
Go and find him?
Get a gun and shoot him?
That's your job, and I don't envy you.
Sentiments, Mr. Whitney.
Sentiments?
Yes.
How do you think Eddie will feel when he finds out he killed Father Dolan?
I can still see Father Dolan's face.
Eddie.
kid, it's no use talking.
Go back to Bonnie and forget you ever met me.
I'll never give you up again.
It wasn't your fault, it was mine.
I killed Father Dolan the night I wouldn't let you run away.
We're going on together. We have a right to live.
You have, I haven't. They'll get me...
Maybe they will, and if they do, they'll get me too.
But they'll have to find us first.
Operator, give me the Sheriff's office, quick.
This is the R and E service station.
Taylor just stuck us up. Yeah, a green sedan.
No, the licence plates were covered with mud.
They took tyres and gas.
Tell him they took all the cash.
They robbed the cash register too.
I got word that the police had them bottled up... but they slipped through again.
I wonder if the baby is born yet.
They're being blamed for every crime committed in the country.
Why are you stopping?
We have to pass through a town pretty soon.
These bullet holes tell too much.
I'll get it for you.
I'm alright.
Don't take any chances.
Lucky they didn't hit us.
Here, drink some.
I'm not hungry. You need it.
From all they've stole, they must be millionaires by now.
Probably hiding in a swell place, having a good time.
We'll find a place soon.
Sure, kid.
You ought to let me take you to a hospital.
They'll kill you, if we don't keep out of towns. What if they do?
You've got something to live for now.
We've got something to live for.
If they kill you, I'll have nothing.
We'll beat this thing yet, kid.
Joan.
Eddie.
I'm afraid we have to get going.
I know.
I wouldn't like to take the chance of staying any longer.
We're ready, aren't we, darling?
Cute.
Is it Joan?
No.
Just a truck.
Something must've happened.
Do you think the police coulďve steamed open Eddie's letter?
I didn't think so at first, but now I'm afraid they did.
I hope I'm wrong.
What a relief it'll be to get her on board that ship.
Joan.
Joan.
I didn't think you'd ever get here.
Stephen.
Have you got any milk?
Thanks, Stephen.
Is it a boy or a girl?
It's a boy.
What's his name?
We just call him baby.
Let me hold him.
Careful.
We love him, he's the best baby in the whole world.
Dash, he's cute.
I've written everything out.
keep him well and happy, until I can send for him.
Joan, you aren't going?
Eddie is waiting for me.
You can't. Not after Stephen has sacrificed everything.
Risked his career, just to get you out of the country.
Everything's ready. Baby's clothes, clothes for you.
Joan, please listen to me.
It's a 10 year jail sentence for you if you're found with Eddie.
If you take this boat to Havana, I'll clear your name while you're away.
You can't refuse, for the sake of the baby.
I appreciate everything you've done, but I can't leave Eddie.
Don't worry about me, I'll be alright.
We'll get across the border before it gets light... and when we do, I won't lose a minute sending for Bonnie and the baby.
Bonnie, I can't.
Goodbye, Stephen. Eddie asked me to thank you for everything.
Come closer, Joan.
I never knew two people could be so close.
The last sign said 6 miles from the border.
It's just a star.
The morning star.
Back there, I watched through the cabin window.
You and the baby looked so warm and safe, inside a house.
Lots of people in love get to live inside a house...
That doesn't matter now.
Maybe anywhere is our home.
In the car, out on that cold star, anywhere's our home.
There's something I never told you. I shoulďve told you a long time ago.
Thanks, Joan, for loving me.
Come closer, Joan.
I bought some cigarettes.
Eddie, look out!
Darling, are you hurt?
He didn't scratch me.
Hit you?
Don't be afraid, darling. We'll make it.
Eddie.
Come on, darling, it isn't far now.
Only a few steps, darling, it's only a few steps.
We're okay, kid, we're okay.
Joan.
I'd do it again, darling, all over again. Gladly.
Eddie.
Eddie.
You're free, Eddie! The gates are open!
THE HUMAN BEAST
This is the story of Jacques Lantier, son of Auguste and Gervaise Lantier, of the Rougon-Macquart family.
At times this hereditary flaw weighed heavily upon him.
He felt he was paying the price for the generations of his forefathers whose drinking had poisoned his blood.
His head felt as if it would explode in the throes of his suffering.
He was compelled to commit acts beyond the control of his will, acts whose causes lay hidden deep within him. "
Did you feel that?
The axle box is overheated.
It's not for lack of oil. She's knocking it back.
Did you see your wife in Paris, Pecqueux?
Yes, Mr. Roubaud.
How is she? Fine.
She's such a complainer, but somehow we get by.
Sir, I have a complaint.
There's a man with a dog.
Please come this way.
Overheated.
It's ruined.
You're just causing trouble.
What's the problem with my dog?
The regulations don't allow dogs in the compartments.
I don't like your tone of voice. Do you know who I am?
I don't need to know. I make no distinctions among passengers.
Well, I'll teach you to make some.
What's your name?
Roubaud, stationmaster.
You'll be hearing from me.
And you from me. I'll be submitting my report.
Roubaud, did you say?
Yes, and I'm proud of it.
Thank you. Very kind of you.
Not at all, ma'am.
Some people need to be taught a lesson.
You know who that fellow is?
No.
That's Turlot, the sugar tycoon.
He's got lots of clout.
He's already gotten two people fired. He could ruin your career.
But that woman voiced a formal complaint.
All right.
Here we go.
Hello, Roubaud.
Hello, Inspector.
Aren't you working nights?
Luckily not right now.
Join us for cards at the café later?
I'm not so keen on cards.
Besides, the wife's waiting.
Lucky devil!
Good day, Miss Dauvergne. Hello, stranger.
You must stop by and see my wife.
I'd hate to be a bother.
I saw her just this afternoon.
You had a nice chat, then? - You can bet they did.
Séverine.
You're off already?
No, but I've got five minutes. Enough time for a kiss.
You haven't been out yet?
Not yet. Miss Dauvergne stopped by.
We chatted a bit.
Well, It's going, but not so great. How is it going?
I got into an argument. Some VIP might make trouble for me.
What kind of trouble?
Maybe you could talk to your godfather.
Really?
Why? Does the thought scare you?
Not at all.
You've often said how he used to terrify you when you were young.
Terrify me?
Don't exaggerate.
All the other kids were scared of him, even his daughter.
Whenever he'd show up, everyone would run away.
But I'd stand my ground.
He'd smile and pat me on the cheek.
I always got what I wanted, and he never scolded me.
Then perhaps you could ask him for a little favor.
Would it mean that much to you?
Yes.
And that way we could visit Paris.
You could do some shopping, and I'd meet you at Victoire's place.
Fine. I'll talk to him.
How's it going, boys?
Lantier, did you get in on time?
Yeah, but I have an axle problem.
Rotten luck.
What train are you on?
The 112.
I'll see you boys later. - Bye now.
I've got a problem with my axle.
Can you take care of it?
If It's burned out, you didn't give it enough oil.
What do you mean?
I spend lots on oil every month. But Lison is always so thirsty.
Who's Lison?
My locomotive.
Well, you'll have to pay for the repairs.
We'll see about that.
So what should I do, go back to Paris?
No point. Repairs will take 36 hours.
Just stay here and rest up.
Fine.
You can let the fire go out.
She'll be fixed day after tomorrow.
What's for lunch?
Sardines and cassoulet. Want some?
No, that canned food rots the gut.
Get a wife, my friend.
I'm already married to Lison. She's good enough for me.
That's right.
I forgot. You're married to a locomotive.
It was an easy ride today. The wind was with us all the way.
Saved a ton of coal and made ourselves some money.
The axle's got you worried.
Only 'cause it happened here.
Back home I know all the mechanics.
They do good work here too.
Philomène is going to be happy.
That's right, your number two girl. Sauvagnat's sister.
Just don't tell him that.
He still thinks she's a nice girl.
And what will your wife do?
Victoire? Queen of the nice girls.
Pass me a bit of your ham for my eggs.
Ham and eggs? - Yes.
What are you doing tomorrow?
First I'll check on the repairs.
Then I'll stop by to see my godmother.
Your godmother lives in Le Havre?
No, not in Le Havre.
Mrs. Misard is the guard at the crossing near Breauté.
She's always sitting out in her garden. Haven't you ever noticed?
What train are you on?
The 116.
Why do you ask?
Can you tell my wife we got a problem with an axle?
We'll be heading back in two days' time.
You know which one she is?
Victoire.
She's the lavatory attendant at the St. Lazare station.
You can count on me.
How are things, Misard?
We don't see much of you around here.
That's work for you. Is my godmother here?
Yes, go on in.
Will you be staying with us today?
Feeling better?
Jacques, It's you.
It's so nice to see you.
Is something the matter?
No, things have never been better.
Other than Lison breaking down on me.
Now you can get yourself some rest, and I can get a good look at you.
You know I see you often, but you fly by so fast on the train that I can hardly recognize you.
What about your attacks?
You remember the ones you had here.
The ones that had the doctor so mystified.
I'm all better now.
Your symptoms have all disappeared?
Those pounding headaches and sudden fevers.
The waves of despair that had you hiding like an animal in a hole.
Things are better now. Much better.
I'm glad.
Seeing you ill doesn't do me any good.
At your age you should be in good health.
Flore's down by the river.
Yes, I'll go find her.
You were watching me.
So? No law against that.
We were only watching 'cause you're so pretty.
I don't want people looking at me or thinking I'm pretty.
I can't believe how you've changed.
You're a big girl now.
You've changed too.
Now you look at me like the others do.
I don't like that.
You gonna push me in the water too?
I will if you don't leave me alone.
Jacques, what's the matter with you?
What got into you?
Oh, I don't know.
I didn't even know what I was doing.
Is that part of your illness?
Yes.
Did your mother tell you about it?
Yes, that's it.
It's like this haze fills my head and twists everything out of shape.
I start feeling like a mad dog.
I never drink, mind you.
Even a drop and I go crazy.
I feel like I'm paying for all those fathers and grandfathers who drank.
All those generations of drunkards who poisoned my blood and saddled me with this madness.
It's a terrible thing.
But I love you with all my heart.
So much that I was afraid to come here.
I love you too.
I'd like to be your wife.
I'd take that chance if you'd let me.
Don't be silly.
Don't be angry with me.
What can I do?
I think that me and women -
Roubaud!
How's Séverine? I hope she's not sick.
She's fine.
She's gone shopping. - Good for her.
Her mother liked a bit of shopping as well.
I told her I'd meet her at your place as usual.
How's your husband?
Pecqueux's in Le Havre.
Mechanical problems. Didn't you know?
No.
I can't keep up with it all.
Of course not.
Just stop by the lavatory and drop off the key.
Any message for your husband?
Oh, I'm not worried.
He's got everything he needs in Le Havre.
See you soon. - Right.
Is my godfather here?
Yes, Mr. Grandmorin is in.
I'll tell his secretary you're here. - It'll be nice to see him.
I'm sure he feels the same.
You've put up new curtains.
I liked the old ones better.
I'll tell him you're here.
Hello, Séverine.
It's been such a long time.
Is my godfather in?
You know Mr. Grandmorin is always happy to see you.
Hello, Godfather.
Hello, Séverine.
You've lost weight.
It may be in style, but I'm not sure I approve.
It's me. You probably thought I'd gotten lost.
I had to run.
The metro was simply impossible, and I didn't want to take a taxi, so I had to run all the way here.
Look how hot I am!
You don't expect me to believe you were shopping all this time.
You horrible man.
You know I love you.
I got a little present for you.
Say "a little present all for me. "
Come on. Say it.
A little present all for me.
What a fine-looking knife!
Look, It's a Nogent.
Let's eat. I'm starving.
How did things go with Grandmorin?
Everything's fine. He called one of his friends at the railroad.
I forget who.
Then he got in touch with Turlot.
So everything's taken care of.
That man has some pull.
It's a good thing he's so fond of you.
Yes, he is fond of me.
He invited me out to the country.
His place in Joinville?
When?
Today.
Did you say no?
Yes.
Why?
I didn't feel like it.
Surely you don't want me doing things I dislike.
You're hiding something.
You act funny whenever Grandmorin's name comes up.
Maybe you're scared people will think you're his daughter.
His daughter?
Your mother was a maid at the mansion.
They all slept with him back then.
We'd sure be in good if you were his daughter.
His daughter.
Could it be?
Do I look like him?
Calm down. I was only joking.
Not here.
We're not at home here.
Let go of me!
What's the matter with you today?
You men are disgusting.
That's all you think of.
You're all the same.
I should throw this ring he gave me out the window.
What?
Who gave it to you?
Who?
Grandmorin.
When?
Ages ago. On my 16th birthday.
You've always said it was a keepsake from your mother.
Did I say that?
You made up a whole story about it.
Why did you lie about your mother?
I never said it was my mother's.
You were his mistress, weren't you?
Tell me the truth, you slut!
Let's hear it, goddamn you!
It's true!
Now let me go.
You've made a real fool of me.
An old man's cast-off.
Did you plan to drive to Joinville?
Were you going to take the train?
The 6:20 for Le Havre?
Our train.
He has to be on it too.
Come here.
Hurry up!
Sit down.
Write this down:
Take the 6:20 train at St. Lazare.
I'll meet you in your compartment. "
What are you going to do?
You'll see.
In fact, you're going to help me.
That will bind us together.
Now there'll be a solid bond between us.
Did you drop by for a look around?
Hey, It's Lantier.
Cabuche, how are things?
Not bad. Did you see the Misards?
Yes. Where are you going?
Le Havre.
After a month in the old burg, It's time to see the city again.
Have a good time.
You know, this train's half empty.
There's hardly any passengers during the week.
Fine with me. I can sleep right through until Le Havre.
Don't go!
Come with me.
He saw us.
I'll have a word with him.
Nice day.
The heat was unbearable in Paris.
Chief!
Did you see anything?
Nothing, Inspector.
The train was almost empty.
And you, sir.
Yes, sir. - And you slept the whole time?
Yes, sir.
Where were you at the time, Lantier?
In the corridor.
Did you see anyone go by?
Well, Inspector, I -
I had something in my eye, so I wasn't paying attention.
Grandmorin was killed?
He sure had it coming.
No more pretty girls for him!
Lantier, what do you think?
About what?
About the murder.
What do you want me to say?
We can't lose sleep over it.
I'm gonna eat and hit the sack.
Did you have a good day?
Do you know Mrs. Roubaud, the stationmaster's wife?
Séverine?
Is that her name?
Her mother and my wife were friends.
They worked together at the Grandmorin mansion.
Why?
Did you see her somewhere?
She was on the train just now.
An elegant woman.
Well-educated.
Not my type, but definitely pretty.
Funny you should happen to mention Grandmorin.
He was found dead on the train I just came in on.
Stabbed to death.
Sure, it was awful to take his money and watch.
It's humiliating. But that's what will save us.
They know people like us don't kill for money.
What worries me is your letter.
Ah, yes. My letter.
It must still be on his desk.
His secretary could have it.
Then we'd be done for.
He wouldn't dare show it to anyone.
You're right. Too scared of scandal.
What's going to happen to us?
Our lives will go on like before.
Grandmorin was just an accident.
But I've taken care of the problem. It's nobody's concern but ours.
What about Lantier?
From what he told the inspector, he must not have seen us.
I'm not so sure.
Why don't you just burn the money?
What?
It might be best.
A wad like that? That would be a shame.
I wouldn't dare spend it, but I won't throw it away either.
What's on your mind?
Lantier.
There must be a way to win over a fellow like that.
It's so nice out.
Yes, It's lovely.
Mr. Lantier,
I'd like to bring up a delicate matter.
What's that?
The other night at the station you told the inspector you hadn't seen anyone in the corridor.
Was that the truth?
I saw you and your husband quite clearly.
Why didn't you say anything?
Because you asked me not to.
I did? I didn't ask you anything.
Yes, you did.
Maybe not with words, but with your eyes.
So you think I'm guilty?
Yes.
You're wrong.
I'm not guilty.
I admit, things might have looked suspicious, but -
I'll say no more, but it was just a coincidence, I swear.
Just an unfortunate coincidence.
Do you believe me?
I'm not guilty.
You won't hurt me, will you?
Mrs. Roubaud, I was the only one who saw you.
Rest easy. I won't tell a soul.
I'm your friend.
You can trust me completely.
Let go of my hands.
And stop looking at me like that. You'll hurt your eyes.
So, then, if someone had gone down the corridor to get to Mr. Grandmorin, you would have seen him?
Absolutely.
But you didn't see anyone?
That's right, Your Honor.
Thank you, Mr. Lantier.
Please send in Cabuche.
Did it go all right?
What did they ask you?
The same as at the station.
Where I was and if I'd seen anything.
What did you say?
I said I was in the corridor and didn't see anything.
Did you know Mr. Grandmorin?
Yes, Your Honor.
Perhaps too well.
A girl named Louisette worked for him as a maid.
This Louisette was your mistress.
No, damn it!
That's a vicious lie, Your Honor!
She wasn't my mistress!
You're a violent man.
You served five years in prison for killing a man in a fight.
He hit me first.
Besides, it wasn't five years.
They let me out in four.
So you claim this Louisette was not your mistress.
Your Honor, you have to understand, she was a little girl when I got out.
You know, the whole village despised me.
They could have stoned me.
But she would smile and say hello.
She was so nice, Your Honor.
So we got to be good friends.
In the summer we'd pick strawberries together.
In the fall we'd go looking for chestnuts.
Sometimes we'd walk through the forest hand in hand.
It was wonderful, Your Honor.
But nothing ever happened.
It could have happened, but it never did.
I mean, she was growing up, and I really liked her.
And she liked me too.
But she went away to work for Grandmorin.
Then one night, she showed up at my door.
I had a cabin in the woods.
Your Honor, she was so distraught that she was shivering with fever.
She didn't want to go back to her parents.
She just wanted to die in my arms.
I should've killed the bastard right then and there!
Grandmorin's life was beyond reproach.
Is the arrest warrant ready?
Roubaud, this long wait is frustrating.
It's a good thing most of the witnesses are passengers.
At least they don't work on the line.
It's better that way.
Indeed. I think they're questioning a fellow named Cabuche right now.
We know no one could have come from the other end of the train.
And you're the only one with a grievance against Mr. Grandmorin.
Admit it:
You killed him.
I'm telling you, it wasn't me.
You're really starting to annoy me!
I say you killed him.
Take him away.
It wasn't me!
Let me go! Your Honor!
It wasn't me!
Did you see his eyes?
I can always tell by their eyes. He's our man.
This Cabuche business is bothering me.
I know the guy.
I'd be surprised if he did it.
If he went to jail, I'd have to do something, 'cause he's not guilty.
Mrs. Roubaud, is that you in this picture?
Yes, when I was a little girl, with my godfather.
Mr. Grandmorin was your godfather?
Yes. What a sorry affair. My wife still hasn't gotten over it.
You really should visit more often.
You'd have some nice home cooking for a change, and it would do us some good as well.
You're very kind. Good-bye.
Good-bye, Lantier.
Mrs. Roubaud.
Mrs. Roubaud. " How formal!
I'll get the door.
Good-bye, Séverine.
Good-bye, Jacques.
Sorry about the lipstick.
What kind of delivery?
Your wife asked my sister for some embroidery.
What sort of fool do you take me for?
Embroidery!
What's this nonsense?
Darling, It's true. I asked Henriette Dauvergne for it.
I'll show you embroidery!
I'm not stupid. I know why he's here.
Get the hell out of here!
Mrs. Roubaud, I'm so sorry. If only I'd known.
He better not come back or I'll take care of him!
These young bucks expect a married woman to be a pushover and the husband to look the other way.
It makes my blood boil.
If that ever happened, I'd wring her neck.
Roubaud, please calm down.
I'm sorry.
How stupid of me. I know you'd have sent him packing.
Lantier, I wasn't including you in that bunch.
Come, let's have another drink.
No, thank you.
I have to go.
Please don't be angry with me.
If I get violent, It's because I love you.
Give me a kiss.
Never again, you hear?
Whenever I look up at your face, it makes me afraid.
I see you back in the train.
What you told Lantier was right.
I haven't gotten over it.
I'll never get over it.
I can't forget it either.
But if we don't, life will become unbearable for the two of us, here in this place.
I'm going out.
Where?
The café.
I'm meeting Cauche and the others.
If they're going to the café, why shouldn't I?
Please forgive me, Séverine.
What was the matter with Roubaud?
Oh, he's just been a little jumpy lately.
He's not hurting you, is he?
I don't think you should stay here.
Why not come with me?
I love you.
You love me?
Yes. I've loved you for some time now.
Why don't you come with me?
You love me?
Yes.
This is terrible.
What do you mean?
You mustn't.
Why not? - You mustn't.
But why not?
I'm incapable of loving anyone.
Are you saying you could never love me?
Jacques, I love you as much as I'm able to love anyone.
Don't be angry.
My life hasn't been a happy one.
My childhood was so horrible.
I'm still afraid sometimes.
It's not a lover I need but a good friend who I could talk to about my troubles, my disappointments, my hopes.
I need trust and tenderness, and I can give them in return.
But not love.
You mustn't ask for that.
I understand, Séverine.
Perhaps It's better this way.
I could tell you a few things as well.
It's better this way.
We'll just be good friends.
Lison is such a funny name for a train.
You can't call someone you love by a number.
May I get on?
You'll get all dirty.
Who cares?
Wait.
Careful.
There's oil and coal everywhere.
It's so hot up here.
Well, it burns a lot of coal.
It all looks so complicated.
You get used to it.
She's a nice one, huh?
She just might be the best locomotive on these tracks.
So you're in love with a locomotive.
We've been through so much.
Really?
Yes. On the line we see it all.
Even when you're flying by?
Of course. You get to watch the changing seasons.
The leaves uncurling in the spring and drifting to the ground in autumn.
The rabbits in the fields with their little ears sticking up.
They watch us go by.
They know we'd never harm them.
That's funny.
When I travel, I never notice a thing.
Perhaps you don't know how to look.
My hands are all black now.
Let me see them again.
No, I must go home.
Will you come back again, Séverine?
Yes, Jacques.
I'm sorry. I'll have to pay you tomorrow.
Your luck wasn't so good.
No, it wasn't.
Good night, Roubaud.
Good night, Cauche.
So you got yourself a partridge?
Just before the storm. They were flying low. This one stuck to the front of the train.
The train was still moving?
Sure was. I had to jump for it!
I know everyone does it, but that's crazy.
What do you mean, crazy? Don't you like partridge?
No, it doesn't agree with me.
Just the other day Lison hit a cow.
Right, Lantier?
Did you bring back some beef?
Hardly. We sent it flying 30 feet.
If we'd run over it, we would have derailed.
Dead cow is not a pretty sight. Aren't you gonna eat?
No, help yourself to what's in my lunch box.
Don't mind if I do.
Got yourself a date?
Yes.
Think she'll show?
Maybe.
Women like that are like cats.
They don't like getting their feet wet.
What do you know about "women like that"?
Oh, I can guess.
I'm suspicious of women who have no children.
What about Philomène and Victoire?
You haven't gotten them pregnant yet.
It'll happen one day.
I love kids. I've got loads of them.
One's in high school in Le Havre.
He's been accepted at the university.
Good for the university.
Were you expecting me?
Yes.
I love you, Jacques.
So you do love me?
There's something I have to tell you.
No, don't say a word.
Good night. - You're heading home late.
So are you.
I'm working.
Good night, then.
Thief.
What do you care? You don't have to touch it. It's none of your business.
I don't understand you.
You used to be an honest man.
When things go bad at home, you find other interests.
Since you don't love me anymore -
You're right, I don't.
Then get off my back.
Do I judge you or get in your way?
Perhaps your boyfriend would like a watch.
Just don't let him flash it around or he'll end up in jail.
Thief! You make me sick.
Don't you want to split it with me?
Aren't we in this together?
Grandmorin will be our lifelong bond.
Even if you run off with Lantier, one day you'll come crawling back.
How sweet. You're so thoughtful.
I thought you might be hungry.
I'm starving.
Shall I get us some chicken?
No, stay here with me.
Wine from Malaga!
If I could, I'd run away with you.
What's keeping you here?
Darling, you have no idea.
Yes, I do.
It was Roubaud who killed Grandmorin.
It all started right here in this room.
All because of a ring Grandmorin gave me.
Grandmorin?
If you only knew how Roubaud treated me.
He knocked me down and dragged me around by my hair, and then he beat me.
At one point he had his heel right in my face, ready to smash it in.
I'll never forget it as long as I live.
He's just a jealous monster.
Do you still love me now - now that you know that?
Of course.
Your past is your business.
You made the decision to marry Roubaud.
But the fact that you were that old man's mistress -
That's a little strange.
I've never loved anyone but you.
If only you knew what the others were like.
Wait a minute.
What about the old man?
Roubaud killed him.
Yes, I know, but didn't you help him?
No, but I saw it all.
You did?
It happened in a tunnel.
The noise was just awful.
My blood still runs cold at the thought.
But tell me... how did he kill him?
With a knife I gave him.
A knife?
How many times did he stab him?
Just once.
What was it like to see him stabbed to death?
I don't know.
Why are you lying to me?
Come on, tell me the truth.
It was awful.
That one minute was more intense than all the rest of my life combined.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
You had me scared.
Love me, darling... because only your love can help me forget.
I love you with all my heart.
Don't be scared.
I need your love too.
Is something wrong?
Tell me.
It's all in my head.
Waves of grief. I get so miserable I can't even speak.
If my husband were out of the way, we could put our troubles behind us.
But we can't just kill him.
Yesterday he almost got crushed between two train cars.
I was so close to being free.
One morning you're fine, and by the evening you're dead.
Were you getting worried?
No, I knew you'd come.
He'll be here.
He came upstairs.
I saw him take his gun.
He'll be making his rounds.
Come with me.
Some thieves broke in last night.
They stole some lead piping.
Over there.
He'll show up. I just know it.
What was that?
I thought I heard someone call out.
No, it was just one of the cars.
They're moving a train.
Somebody's moving around in that car.
No, It's just rats.
This place is full of them.
There he is.
Where? I don't see him.
He's coming around the shed.
He's coming toward us.
I see his shadow on the wall.
Is he alone?
I can't do it.
I can't do it.
Put my hammer in the smoke box.
So It's all over? You won't be seeing her again?
Everything has to end sooner or later.
You had some good times together.
Love is best early on, before you know each other well, when you're both on your best behavior.
Take me, for example. I don't care for dancing, but she does.
So I take her out because I'm a nice guy.
I guess I owe it to her.
Her brother caught us in bed the other night.
I barely had time to jump out the window in my shirt.
Then he slapped her around.
Does that make sense to you?
Not to me.
She's his sister, not his wife.
What's it to him anyway?
The poor kid.
Look at Roubaud's wife.
She looks just like a princess.
Not bad for the wife of a stationmaster.
Is something going on between you two?
You mean Dauvergne?
No, not yet.
Today he kissed me on the hand, but not on the lips.
Is he in love with you? - Yes.
I even wondered what it would be like to love him back.
To start anew.
A better life.
Maybe not happier, but at least more peaceful.
I'm being honest with you, and I know you believe me.
Why lie to each other now?
There's no way forward for us now.
We can't go any further.
Our dream of running off and living together, all the happiness you might have made come true -
It's all impossible now, because you couldn't go through with it the other night.
Oh, I'm not blaming you.
In fact, It's better it didn't happen.
But I have nothing left to hope for with you.
Tomorrow will be just like yesterday:
the same grief and sorrow.
It doesn't really matter. What happens, happens.
All I can do is go on living my miserable life until Roubaud kills me.
Because one of these days he will.
I can tell by the look in his eyes.
Leave him.
Come live with me.
Killing you won't make him happy.
He said he'd find me, and I believe him.
Only death can break the ties that bind me to him.
Shall we dance?
Then I'll be going.
Why? There are others to dance with.
Like Dauvergne.
Tonight I only want to dance with you.
Good night, Jacques.
Will you dance with her?
I always step on their toes, and they get mad.
Is something wrong?
Where's Roubaud?
At the café.
Listen.
Let's get it over with tonight.
I'll do it this time, I swear.
I won't ask again for something you can't do.
Not tonight, anyway.
Tonight I'm afraid.
I sense some danger around me.
But It's the only way to have you to myself.
We have to do it.
No, Jacques.
I don't believe it anymore.
I told you before:
There's no way forward for us now.
We should have stayed like we were in the beginning, when we loved each other but didn't pursue it.
You remember those innocent walks we used to take?
They helped me forget about Grandmorin.
When you've experienced all the disgusting things I knew as a young girl,
It's madness to hope for a true love of your own.
No, you'll forget the past and we'll be happy.
Every night I dream we're together, far away.
I go to work. We have a little home together.
Every evening you're waiting for me at the door, and I take you in my arms and hold you tight.
We love each other like no two people ever have before.
They'll leave us alone, and we'll put the past behind us.
They'll know you did it. You'll go to jail.
I'll never see you again.
No, it'll look like a suicide.
He's been acting so strange lately, it won't surprise anyone that he'd shoot himself.
There he is now.
Yes, It's him.
Come.
Kiss me.
With all your heart and soul.
Listen.
You hide behind the door, and I'll open it.
Don't hesitate.
Do it right then and there.
Once and for all.
Kiss me.
What's the matter, Jacques?
Why me, Jacques?
Let's go.
I thought you didn't like dancing.
Don't you like it here?
You're the one who wanted to come.
Besides, Lantier might be back.
We can at least wait five minutes.
This is a little story
About Ninette's little heart
She offers it to everyone
But never gives it away
That's a pity for anyone
Who tries to win her heart
Whoever tries to love Ninette
Will end up with a broken heart
Ninon's little heart
Is tiny and frail and adorable
Like a little butterfly
Ninon's little heart
Is tender and sweet If the poor lass flirts a bit and won't behave
It's no fault
Of Ninon's little heart
Where the hell can he be?
He's never been late in all the time we've worked together.
Who?
Lantier.
Who's Lantier? Jacques Lantier. From the Batignolles depot.
Don't you know him?
Are you okay?
Didn't you sleep well?
I'm fine.
I did your job.
Here are your overalls.
Hurry, we've only got two minutes.
Let me see your waybill.
520 tons.
Didn't you get any sleep?
So you saw her again?
So you're still seeing each other?
Pecqueux, I have to tell you something.
Don't say a word and don't move.
I killed her.
That's right.
It's all over. I'll never see her again.
It'll be the death of me, I know it.
I couldn't bear to hold her anymore.
I loved her, you know.
I loved her little hands most of all.
But there's one thing I don't get:
Why haven't they arrested me?
If I were in your shoes,
I'd turn myself in.
I'd tell them everything that happened.
They'd understand.
I can't go on!
Poor guy.
How he must have suffered to come to this.
I haven't seen him look so peaceful in a long time.
We need to clear the tracks.
Take the train to the next station.
I'll stay here with him.
Hello.
What's all this fuss about, Charters?
I'm hanged if I know.
Danke schön.
Danke schön.
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm very sorry. The train is little bit uphold.
And if you wish to stay in my hotel, you have to register immediately.
Why the deuce didn't he say so in the first place?
Oh, how do you do, Miss Henderson?
How do you do, ladies?
It's a great honor to have you with us again.
Nice to see you too, Boris.
You haven't changed a bit since last Friday.
I see you haven't shaved either.
Is everything ready?
Everything is ready. I didn't change anything.
Not even the sheets. We know. Lead on, Boris.
You see, I didn't expect you to come so quickly.
Well, our legs gave out on us. - That's odd. - We had to do the last lap in a farm cart.
Oh! I see we've got company.
Don't tell me Cook's are running cheap tours here.
What is it, Boris?
It's the avalanche.
Avalanche?
Avalanche, Boris. Avalanche.
You see, in the spring we've got many avalanches.
You know, - bloop!
And everything disappear. Even train disappear under the avalanche.
But I'm going home tomorrow.
How long before they dig it out?
By morning. It's lucky for you.
You can leave by this train instead of your own.
How you said it?
Is a bad wind that blow nowhere no good.
Talking of wind, we haven't eaten since dawn.
Serve us some supper, Boris, in our room.
I could eat a horse.
Don't put ideas into his head.
Uh, some chicken, Boris. - Yes.
And a magnum of champagne.
Absolutely.
And make it snappy.
Bandrika may have a dictator, but tonight we're painting it red.
Meanwhile we have to stand here cooling our heels, I suppose, eh?
Confounded impudence.
Oh, third-rate country. What do you expect?
Wonder who all those women were.
Hmm. Possibly Americans, I should think.
You know, almighty dollar, old man.
I suppose we'll have to wait here.
If only we hadn't missed that train at Budapest.
I don't want to rub it in, but if you hadn't insisted... on standing up until they finished their national anthem -
Yes, but you must show respect, Caldicott.
If I'd known it was going to last 20 minutes -
Well, it's always been my contention that The Hungarian Rhapsody... is not their national anthem.
In any case, we were the only two standing.
Well, I suppose we shall be in time after all.
I doubt it. That last report was pretty ghastly.
Do you remember? "England on the brink."
Yes, but that's newspaper sensationalism.
The old country's been in some tight corners before.
It looks pretty black.
Even if we get away first thing tomorrow morning, there's still the connection at B♪öâle. - We'll probably be hours.
Mmm, that's true.
Well, somebody surely can help us.
Would you happen to know what time the train leaves Bâle for England?
Oh.
Really?
Fella doesn't speak English.
Hello?
Alex. Champagne.
Miss Henderson.
Here's one leaves Bâle 21:20.
21:20?
Yeah. - Twenty. Twenty.
Twelve from 21 is - - Twenty-one - - Eleven.
I regret, sir, there is only left two single room in front... or a little double room at the back.
We'll, uh, take the two singles.
Very well, sir. Here is.
Thank you. - Thank you.
At least you might have asked me which I preferred.
My dear, a small double room at the back in a place like this -
You weren't so particular in Paris last autumn.
It was quite different then. The exhibition was at its height.
I realize that now.
There's no need to rub it in.
We want a private suite with a bath. - Facing the mountain.
Yes.
With a shower, of course.
Hot and cold.
A private thingummy if you've got one.
Sorry, gentlemen. The only things I've got is the maid's room.
The what?
Maid's room?
I'm sorry. The whole hotel is packed. Jammed to the sky.
That's impossible. We haven't fixed up yet.
You can't expect to put the two of us up in the maid's room.
Well, don't get excited. I'll remove the maid out.
Yes, I should think so.
What are you talking about?
I think I'd sooner sleep on the train. - Would you?
There is no 'eating on the train. - No eating on the train?
Yes.
I mean - Heating.
Heating. There's no heating on the train. - That's awkward.
all right. We'll take it.
Just a minute. With one condition. You have to have the maid comes to your room, remove her wardrobe.
Anna.
She's a good girl, and I don't want to lose her.
We'd better go and dress.
Rather primitive humor, I hope.
Grown-up children, you know. That was rather an awkward situation over that girl.
Pity he couldn't have given us one each.
I mean, uh, a room apiece.
I, Iris Matilda Henderson... a spinster of no particular parish... do hereby solemnly renounce my maidenly past... and do declare that on Thursday next, the 26th inst., being in my right mind...
I shall take the veil and the orange blossom... and change my name to Lady Charles Fotheringail.
Can't you get him to change his name instead?
The only thing I like about him is his mustache.
You're a couple of cynics. I'm very fond of him.
Well, I'm fond of rabbits, but they have to be kept down.
Rudolph, give me a hand.
Have you ever read about that little thing called love?
It used to be very popular.
Child, the carpet is already laid at St. George's, Hanover Square.
And Father's simply aching to have a coat of arms on the jam label.
To Iris and the happy days she's leaving behind.
And the blue-blooded check-chaser she's dashing to London to marry.
The blue-blooded check-chaser.
I have no regrets.
I've been everywhere and done everything.
I've eaten caviar at Cannes... sausage rolls at the docks.
I've played baccarat at Biarritz... and darts with the rural dean.
What is there left for me but... marriage?
It's this hanging about that gets me.
If only we knew what was happening in England.
Mustn't lose grip, Charters.
Come in.
Did you follow that?
I did.
Tell her this has gone far enough.
No, uh - No change, uh - change here.
Um, outside.
She doesn't understand.
No. Come on.
Nothing newer than last month.
I don't suppose there is such a thing as a wireless set hereabouts.
Being in the dark like this - our communications cut off in a time of crisis.
Hello, hello, hello!
You want Mr. Seltzer?
Yes. Hold on. I'm going right to - to find where he is.
London.
Go on.
Hello. Hello. You.
You in London. Huh?
No, no, no. I'm not Mr. Seltzer.
Name's Charters. I don't suppose you know me.
Well, you needn't worry. They've just gone to fetch him.
Tell me. What's happening to England?
Blowing a gale"?
No, you don't follow me, sir.
I'm inquiring about the test match in Manchester.
Cricket, sir!
Cricket!
What? You don't know?
You can't be in England and not know the test score.
Fella says he doesn't know.
Hello. Can't you find out? Nonsense.
Oh, all right. If you won't, you won't!
Wasting my time. The fella's an ignoramus.
Mr. Seltzer... at last your call come through to London.
Hello.
Hello, hello.
Huh? London.
Thank you, waiter.
What do you say to a grilled steak?
That's a very good idea.
Well done for me, please.
On the red side for me.
These people have a passion for repeating themselves.
I beg your pardon.
Mm-hmm? He's trying to explain to you that, owing to the large number of visitors, there's no food left.
No food?
What sort of place is this?
Expect us to share a blasted dog box with a servant girl on an empty stomach?
Is that hospitality? Is that organization?
Oh. Thank you.
I'm hungry, you know. - What a country.
I don't wonder they have revolutions.
You're very welcome to what's left of the cheese.
Uh, of course, it's not like beefsteak, but it's awfully rich in vitamins.
Really. Thank you very much.
I'm afraid they're not accustomed to catering for so many people.
Bandrika is one of Europe's few undiscovered corners. Yes.
That's probably 'cause there's nothing worth discovering, I should think.
You may not know it as well as I do.
I'm feeling quite miserable at the thought of leaving it.
After you with the cheese, please.
Certainly, old man. Why not?
So you're going home?
Tomorrow. My little charges are quite grown up.
I'm a governess and a music teacher, you know.
In the six years I've lived here, I've grown to love the country, especially the mountains.
I sometimes think they're like very friendly neighbors.
You know, the - the big father and mother mountain with their white snow hats.
And their nephews and nieces. Not quite so big. With smaller hats.
Right down to the tiniest hillock without any hat at all.
Well, of course, that's just my fancy.
Oh, really.
I like to watch them from my bedroom every night when there's a moon.
I'm so glad there's a moon tonight.
Do you hear that music?
Everyone sings here.
The people are just like happy children... with laughter on their lips and music in their hearts.
It's not reflected in their politics, you know.
I never think you should judge any country by its politics.
After all, we English are quite honest by nature, aren't we?
You'll excuse me if I run away.
Good night.
Queer sort of bird.
Trifle whimsical, I thought.
Well, after six years in this hole, we'd be whimsical.
Oh, I don't think so, old man.
She was very decent about that cheese.
I see she's finished the pickles.
Good night, Iris.
Listen. Someone's serenading.
Oh, let him. Nothing will keep me awake tonight.
Good night, my children.
What's happening?
An earthquake?
That would hardly account for the music, would it?
What a horrible noise.
What can they be doing?
I don't know, but I'll soon find out.
Hello.
Musical country, this. - I feel quite sorry for that poor singer outside... having to compete with this. Yes.
Boris, Miss Henderson speaking.
Look. Someone upstairs is playing musical chairs with an elephant.
Move one of them out, will you? I want to get some sleep.
That ought to settle it.
Thank you so much.
Some people have so little consideration for others... which makes life so much more difficult than it need be.
Don't you think? Well, good night. Thank you so much.
I expect you'll be going on the train in the morning.
Yes.
I hope we shall meet again under - under quieter circumstances.
Good night.
Good night.
Miss, please, I'Il fix everything.
You'd better.
Hold it. Steady.
Don't move. Don't move.
If you please, sir -
Get out!
One, two -
Please, sir. Will you kindly stop?
They are all complaining in the hotel. You make too much noise.
Too much what?
Too much noise.
You dare to call it a noise.
The ancient music with which your peasant ancestors... celebrated every wedding for countless generations.
The dance they danced when your father married your mother... always supposing you were born in wedlock, which I doubt.
Look at them.
I take it you're the manager.
Sure I am the manager of this hotel.
Fortunately I'm accustomed to squalor. Tell me. Who's complaining?
This young English lady underneath.
Well, you tell the young English lady underneath... that I am putting on record for the benefit of mankind... one of the lost folk dances of Central Europe... and furthermore, she does not own this hotel.
But, sir, don't you understand?
Now, one, two -
You know what he said? "Who she think she is?
The queen of Sheba?
She think she owns this hotel?"
Well, can't you get rid of him?
Are you sure?
Uh, I begin to wonder.
It's come back to me. I've got an idea.
You see, the German lady. She will call him up on the telephone.
She say, "Young man. It's my room. I did pay for it.
Get out quickly."
How's that, huh?
We'll eject him with a little -
He'll never forget as long as he live.
Nothing but baseball.
You know. We used to call it rounders.
Children play it with a rubber ball and with a stick.
Not a word about cricket.
Americans got no sense of proportion.
Come in.
I can't stand this ridiculous lack of privacy.
Lock the door.
Oh!
Who are you?
What do you want?
Recognize the signature tune?
Will you please get out.
Oh, this is a much better room.
Definitely an acceptable room.
What exactly do you think you're doing?
Keep away.
Would you hold those for a minute?
Put those back at once.
Now, which side do you like to sleep?
Do you want me to throw you out?
Oh, in that case, I'Il sleep in the middle.
Smart of you to bribe the manager.
An eye for an eye... and a tooth for a toothbrush.
I suppose you realize you're behaving like a complete cad.
On the contrary, you're perfectly at liberty to sleep in the corridor if you want to.
Hello.
Oh, I shouldn't if I were you.
I'd only tell everyone you invited me here.
And when I say everyone, I mean everyone.
And I have a powerful voice.
Come out of there at once!
Not until you bribe the manager to restore me to my attic.
Come out of that bathroom!
Hello. Boris?
Look. I was thinking. I
Oh, by the way, you might have my things taken upstairs.
You're the most contemptible person I've ever met in all my life!
Well, confidentially, I think you're a bit of a stinker too.
Well, if we get to Bâle on time, we should see the last day of the match.
I hope the weather's like this in Manchester. Perfect wicket for our fellas.
We're somewhere along here.
If you don't hurry, Margaret, we shan't get that compartment to ourselves.
Does it matter?
Well, there's still time to change your mind, Iris.
Yes. Why not send Charles a greetings telegram and tell him he's all washed up?
No. It's too late.
This time next week...
I shall be a slightly sunburnt offering on an altar in Hanover Square.
I shan't mind, really.
Good morning.
I can't find my bag. It's a brown holdall, you know. Have you seen -
No. Of course not. Uh, thank you.
Well, I gave it to the porter.
Oh, she dropped her glasses.
Say, you dropped your glasses. - Oh. Thank you, my dear.
Oh!
Oh, dear, oh, dear, oh, dear!
Darling, are you hurt?
I don't know.
What was it?
Never mind about that.
This cockeyed station of yours has practically brained my friend.
Yes indeed!
Well, what are you going to do about it?
He says he cannot hold the train.
I like that!
Hurry up! It's going.
Yes, my dear.
I'Il be all right.
Are you sure?
Careful. Don't worry. I'll look after her.
You sure you're all right?
Send us a copy of the Times.
Write and tell us all about it.
Good luck. Look after yourself.
There, there. You'll be all right in a minute.
Just take everything quietly.
Put some of this eau de cologne on your head.
Do you feel any better?
Yes, thank you. I'm all right now.
What you need is a good, strong cup of tea.
I'll ring for the attendant.
No, no. Please don't bother.
I'll go to the dining car myself. I need some air.
Oh, well, in that case, I'll come with you.
If you don't mind, that is.
No, of course not.
Oh! I - I beg your pardon.
You can always tell a honeymoon couple, you know. They're so shy.
Why did you do that?
Well, we don't want people staring at us.
Anyone would think the whole legal profession were dogging you.
Oh, one would be enough.
You even thought that beggar in Damascus was a barrister in disguise.
I merely said his face was distinguished enough for a judge.
You hurried off in the opposite direction, I noticed.
That's not true.
I was looking for a street called "Straight."
You weren't so careful the first few days.
I know. I know.
And anyway, as for you meeting someone you know, what about me?
Robert thinks I'm cruising with Mother.
If one's feeling a little bit shaky, I always think it's best to sit in the middle of the coach.
Preferably facing the engine.
Uh, a pot of tea for two, please.
Very good. - Oh, and - and just a minute.
Will you please tell them to make it from this?
I don't drink any other.
Uh, and - and make absolutely sure that the water is really boiling.
You understand?
It's a little fad of mine.
My dear father and mother... who I'm thankful to say are still alive... and enjoying good health, invariably drink it.
And so I follow their footsteps.
Do you know a million Mexicans drink it? At least that's what it says on the packet.
It's very kind of you to help me like this.
I don't think we've introduced ourselves.
My name's Iris Henderson. I'm going home to be married.
Really?
Oh, how very exciting.
I do hope you'Il be happy.
Thank you.
You'Il have children, won't you? They make such a difference.
I always think it's being with kiddies so much that's made me - if I may say so - young for my age.
I'm a governess, you know.
My name's Froy.
Did you say Freud?
No. O-Y. Not E-U-D.
I'm sorry. I can't hear.
Froy. It rhymes with "joy."
Thank you.
Uh, please reserve two places for lunch, will you?
That is if you'd care to have it with me.
Of course.
There's nothing moot about it. It simply wasn't out. That's all.
But for the umpire's blunder, he'd probably still be batting.
What do you mean?
I don't understand. - I'll show you. Look here.
Now then. There's Hammond.
There's the bowler.
There's the umpire.
Sugar?
Two, please.
Dear me. There is no sugar.
Now watch this very, very carefully, Caldicott.
Grimmett was bowling.
May I trouble you for the sugar, please?
What?
The sugar, please.
Thank you so much.
If I were you, I'd try and get a little sleep.
It'll make you feel quite well again.
There's a most intriguing acrostic in The Needlewoman.
I'm going to try and unravel it before you wake up.
Reservations for lunch, please.
Madame has booked for lunch?
Oh, I think my friend did.
Have you seen my friend?
No. Um, my friend.
La signora inglese. The English lady. Where is she?
There has been no English lady here.
What?
There has been no English lady here.
There has. She sat there in the corner.
You saw her. You spoke to her. She sat next to you.
But it's ridiculous. She took me to the dining car and came back here with me.
You went and came back alone.
Maybe you don't understand.
I mean the lady who looked after me when I was knocked out.
Ah. Perhaps it make you forget, eh?
Well, I may be very dense, but if this is some sort of a joke, I'm afraid I don't see the point.
Oh, steward, you served me tea just now.
Yes, madame.
Have you seen the lady I was with?
The English lady.
Pardon, madame. He make mistake.
Well, of course. He must remember the little English lady.
She ordered the tea and paid for it.
No.
He say to look at the bill. I will look, madame.
But she gave you a special packet of tea. You can't have forgotten that.
The tea was ours, madame. I received no packet.
But you did. I know what happened.
Pardon, madame. The bill. - Uh, tea for one.
But that's not right.
Perhaps madame would care to examine the bills herself.
No, I wouldn't. The whole thing's too absurd.
Please, have you seen a lady pass through -
Oh. - Well, well. If it isn't old stinker.
If I thought you were going to be on this train, I'd have stayed another week in the hotel.
Uh, lady? No. Why.
It doesn't matter. You probably wouldn't recognize one anyway.
Hello. Feeling queer?
It's that pipe of yours, George. Why don't you throw your old socks away?
Never mind. Thanks for the help all the same.
Come on. Sit down. Take it easy.
What's the trouble? - If you must know, something fell on my head.
When?
Infancy?
At the station.
Oh.
Bad luck. Can I help?
No. Only by going away.
No, no, no. My father always taught me never desert a lady in trouble.
He even carried that as far as marrying Mother.
I say, did you see a little lady last night in the hotel? In tweeds.
I only saw one little lady. She was hardly in tweeds.
But she was in my compartment, and now I can't find her.
She must be still on the train. We haven't stopped since we started.
Of course she's still on the train.
I know that. - all right. Nobody said she isn't.
Yes, but that's just what they are saying.
Who? The rest of the people in the compartment and the stewards.
They insist they never saw her.
All of them?
all of them. - You were saying you got a knock on the head?
What do you mean?
Never mind. Do you talk the lingo?
No.
Well, they probably thought you were trying to borrow some money.
Come on. Let's knock the idea out of their stupid heads.
A most unfortunate remark. I beg your pardon.
That's one of them.
I say. Excuse me. I think there's been a little misunderstanding.
This young lady seems to have lost her friend.
Yes. I have heard. - This gentleman has been explaining to me.
And I think under the circumstances, we shall all introduce ourselves.
I am Italian citizen. My wife and child.
How do you do? - Oh, bonny little chap.
How old is he? - 1934 class. - Ah.
And the lady in the corner is the Baroness Atona.
Oh, yes. I met her husband. He presented prizes at the folk dance festival.
And I am Dr. Egon Hartz of Prague. You may have heard of me.
Not the brain specialist? - Yes.
The same.
You flew over to England the other day and operated on one of our cabinet ministers.
Oh, yes.
Tell me. Did you find anything?
A slight cerebral contusion.
Oh, well, that's better than nothing.
But I am picking up a similar case at the next station, but so much more complicated.
I shall operate at the national hospital tonight.
Among other things, a cranial fracture with compression. - Do you understand?
Oh, yes. A wallop on the bean.
I suppose you haven't seen my friend.
Unfortunately, no.
I'll just take a word with the baroness.
Uh -
No.
What do they say?
Well, they both say they've never seen her.
But that's not true. She was sitting where you are.
Can you describe her?
Well, it's a bit difficult. You see, she was sort of middle-aged and ordinary.
Well, what was she wearing?
Tweeds, oatmeal flecked with brown... a three-quarter coat with patch pockets... a scarf, a felt hat, brown shoes... a tussah shirt and - and a small blue handkerchief in her breast pocket.
I can't remember any more.
You couldn't have been paying attention.
You both went along to tea.
Yes.
Well, surely you met somebody.
I suppose we did, but - Wait a moment. Let me think.
There was an Englishman who passed the sugar.
Right you are. Let's go along and dig him out.
Pardon me. I'll come with you. This is most interesting to me.
Well, we don't like people muscling in, but we'Il make you a member.
Wait a moment. There was somebody else.
As we passed this compartment, Miss Froy stumbled in.
There was a tall gentleman and a lady.
Now we're getting somewhere. If we can find someone who saw her, we'Il have the place searched.
Can I be of any assistance?
That's the gentleman.
Do you happen to remember seeing this young lady pass the compartment with a little Englishwoman?
I'm afraid not.
But you must have. She almost fell into your compartment.
Surely you haven't forgotten. It's very important.
Everybody's saying she wasn't on the train, but I know she is... and I'm going to find her even if I have to stop the train to do it.
Caldicott.
This is Charters. Can I come in?
You know that girl we saw at the hotel? She's back there kicking up a devil of a fuss. - Says she's lost her friend.
Well, she hasn't been in here, old man.
But the point is she threatens to stop the train.
If we miss our connection in Bâle, we'll never make Manchester in time.
This is serious.
Let's hide in here.
I'm sorry. I haven't the faintest recollection. You must be making a mistake.
Well, he obviously doesn't remember.
Let's go and look for the other fellow.
Who were you talking to outside?
Hmm? Oh, nobody.
Just, uh, some people in the corridor arguing.
There he is. That's the man.
I say. I'm so sorry. I wonder if I can bother you.
I wonder if you can help us.
How? I was having tea about an hour ago with an English lady.
You saw her, didn't you?
I don't know. I mean, definitely. I was talking to my friend.
Wasn't I? - Indubitably.
But you were sitting at the next table.
She turned and borrowed the sugar. You must remember.
I recall passing the sugar.
Then you saw her.
I repeat. We were deep in conversation. We were discussing cricket.
I don't see how a thing like cricket can make you forget seeing people.
Oh, don't you? If that's your attitude, obviously there's nothing more to be said.
Come, Caldicott.
A thing like cricket."
Hmm. Wrong tactics. We should have told him we were looking for a lost cricket ball.
But he spoke to her. There must be some explanation.
There is.
Please forgive me.
I'm quite possibly wrong... but I have known cases where a sudden shock or blow... has induced the most vivid impressions.
I understand. You don't believe me.
Oh, it's not a question of belief.
Even a simple concussion may have curious effects upon an imaginative person.
Yes, but I can remember every little detail.
Her name - Miss Froy. Everything.
So interesting.
You know, if one had time, one could trace the cause of the hallucination.
Hallucination.
Oh, precisely.
There is no Miss Froy. There never was a Miss Froy.
Merely a vivid subjective image.
But I met her last night at the hotel.
You thought you did.
Yes, but what about the name?
Oh, some past association.
An advertisement or a character in a novel, subconsciously remembered.
There is no reason to be frightened... if you are quiet and relaxed.
Thank you very much.
Dravka. If you will excuse me, this is where my patient comes aboard.
Excuse me.
Most interesting.
We're stopping.
This is the first stop, isn't it?
Mm-hmm. Then Miss Froy must still be on the train.
Look. You look out of this window and see if she gets off this side.
I'll take the other.
Most interesting.
What was she dressed in? Scotch tweeds, wasn't it?
Oatmeal tweeds.
Oh, I knew it had something to do with porridge.
How long does it take to get a divorce?
Eric. - Hmm?
Oh, I beg your pardon. I wasn't listening.
I said, "How long does it take to get a divorce?"
Oh, that depends. Why?
I was only wondering whether we could take our honeymoon next spring.
I mean the official one.
The difficulties are considerable. For one thing, the courts are very crowded just now.
Although I suppose we barristers ought not to complain about that.
As a matter of fact, with the - with conditions as they are now, my chances of becoming a judge are very rosy.
That is, if, uh, nothing untoward occurs.
Such as you being mixed up in a divorce case yourself.
Uh, yes.
In that first careless rapture of yours you said you didn't care what happened.
My dear, you must think of it from my point of view.
The law, like Caesar's wife, must be above suspicion.
Even when the law spends six weeks with Caesar's wife?
Look here.
Now I know why you've been running around like a scared rabbit.
Why you lied so deliberately a few minutes ago.
I lied? - Yes.
To those people in the corridor. I heard every word you said.
It was merely that I didn't wish to be mixed up in any inquiry.
Inquiry.
Just because a little woman can't be found -
That girl was making a fuss.
If the woman had disappeared... and I'd admitted having seen her, we might become vital witnesses.
My name might even appear in the papers, coupled with yours.
Why, a scandal like that might lead anywhere.
Anywhere.
Yes. I suppose it might.
Nobody?
Nobody.
Well, the only thing that came out my side was two bits of orange peel and a paper bag.
I know there's a Miss Froy. She's as real as you are.
That's what you say, and you believe it, but there doesn't appear to be anybody else who's seen her.
I saw her, I think.
You did?
A little woman in tweeds.
Yes?
Wearing a three-quarter coat?
With a scarf?
That's right.
I saw her with you when you passed the compartment.
I knew I was right.
But your husband said he hadn't seen her.
Oh, he didn't notice. But as soon as he mentioned it, I remembered at once.
You win.
You know, this calls for action.
Are you prepared to make a statement?
Of course.
If it helps. - Ah. Pardon.
The most fascinating complication. We've some news for you.
This lady actually saw Miss Froy.
So -
We're going to have the train searched.
You'll have to think of a fresh theory now, Doctor.
It is not necessary. My theory was a perfectly good one.
The facts were misleading.
I hope you will find your friend.
Excuse me. - I'll be in here if you want me.
Right you are.
Eric.
I was only going to mention that I told that girl I'd seen her friend.
What's that?
Have you taken leave of your senses?
On the contrary, I've come to them.
What do you mean?
If there's a scandal, there'd be a divorce.
You couldn't let me down, could you?
You'd have to do the decent thing as reluctantly as only you know how.
You forget one very important thing, Margaret.
Your husband would divorce you.
But whatever happens, my wife will never divorce me.
It may seem crazy to you, but I tell you. You're going to search the train.
Ah! Signorina. Down there they look for you.
Your friend. She come back.
Come back? - Sì. Sì.
But what happened?
Oh. You go see.
She tell you. Scusi.
Thanks.
All right, Athelstan. Relax. The crisis is over.
Come on. Let's join the lady.
Here we are.
Miss Froy.
That isn't Miss Froy.
Isn't it?
No.
I say, it's a silly thing to say, but are you Miss Froy?
No.
I am Madame Kummer.
She says she helped you into the carriage after you got the biff on the head, then went to see friends.
The baroness says that as you spoke about an English lady, she didn't connect her with Madame Kummer.
But she wasn't the lady I saw. It was Miss Froy.
Oatmeal tweeds, blouse, blue silk handkerchief.
Yes. Yes, I know. Everything's the same, but it isn't her.
I beg your pardon. When did you say you first met this Miss Froy?
Last night at the hotel.
Oh. And was she wearing a costume like this?
Yes. I think so.
Then I must apologize. - You did meet her after all.
Then -
But not on this train.
In your subconscious mind... you substituted for the face of Madame Kummer that of Miss Froy.
But I didn't. I couldn't have, I tell you. I talked to her here.
That's very easily settled. There's an Englishwoman who said she saw her.
If this lady wouldn't mind - Madame -
Bon. Après vous, mesdames.
What a gift for languages a fellow's got.
I'm so sorry.
Would you tell us, please, is this the woman you saw?
It isn't a bit like her, is it?
Yes, she's the woman.
But it isn't, I tell you. It isn't.
Are you sure?
Perfectly.
She isn't. She isn't.
Well, come on, then. I'm so sorry to have troubled you.
Well, aren't you going to say anything?
You might at least gloat, if nothing else.
What am I expected to say? You only did it to save your own skin.
She was lying. I saw it in her face.
They're all lying, but why? Why?
Now, why don't you sit down and take it easy?
Do you believe this nonsense about substituting Miss Froy's face for Madame Kummer's?
Well, I think any change would be an improvement.
Listen, Miss Froy was on this train.
I know she was, and nothing will convince me otherwise.
Must you follow me round like a pet dog?
Oh. Well, let's say a watchdog. I've got all the better instincts.
Good-bye.
The doctor was right. You're all right.
I never saw Miss Froy on the train. - It didn't happen.
I know now. - I'm glad you're gonna take it like that.
What you want to do is to forget all about it. Just make your mind a complete blank.
You know? Watch me.
Well, what about a spot of something to eat, huh?
Anything. - That's right.
Oh.
Would you like a little air? - Thanks.
Well. Do you think you can eat anything?
I could try.
That's the spirit. You'Il feel a different girl tomorrow.
I hope so.
I don't want to meet my fiancé a nervous wreck.
Your... what?
I'm being married on Thursday.
Quite sure you're not imagining that?
Positive.
Oh, I was afraid so.
Ah, food.
I couldn't face it.
Well, you know best. You mind if I talk with my mouth full?
If you must.
Well, now. Would you like to hear about my early life?
I don't think so.
Well, since you pressed me, I'Il begin with my father.
You know, it's remarkable how many great men began with their father -
Oh, something to drink?
Oh, yes, I will.
A cup of tea, please.
You know, my father was a very colorful character.
Amongst other things, he was strongly addicted to - You'Il never guess.
Harriman's Herbal Tea.
No, wrong. Double scotch.
A million Mexicans drink it.
Maybe they do, but Father didn't.
Miss Froy gave the waiter a packet of it.
Packet of what?
Harriman's Herbal Tea. She said it was the only sort she liked.
I thought we'd agree that you were going to make your mind a complete blank.
But it's so real. I'm sure it happened.
Did we, or did we not?
We did. Sorry.
Go on telling me about your father.
Well, my father was a very remarkable man.
Did he play the clarionet?
Incessantly.
In fact, he never put it down, unless, uh - unless it became absolutely necessary.
Well, naturally I couldn't help inheriting his love of music.
Why not?
It was all he left me.
You know, you're remarkably attractive.
Has anyone ever told you?
We were discussing you.
Yes, of course.
Um, do you like me?
Not much.
Well, after I'd, uh, paid my father's debts...
I started to travel, until they tried to cash the checks.
At the moment, you know, I'm writing a book on folk dancing.
Would you like to buy a copy?
I'd love to.
When does it see the light of day?
Hmm, about four years.
That's a very long time. - Very long book.
Do you know why you fascinate me? I'Il tell you.
You've got two great qualities I used to admire in Father.
You haven't any manners at all, and... you're always seeing things.
Now what's the matter?
Look.
It's gone! - What's gone?
Miss Froy's name on the window.
You saw it.
You must have seen it! She's on the train!
Now steady, steady.
Excuse me. Thank you. It's okay.
We've got to find her. Something's happening to her! - Now -
Stop the train!
Listen, everybody. There's a woman on this train - Miss Froy.
Some of you must have seen her. They're hiding her somewhere.
I appeal to you, all of you, to stop the train.
Now, listen - - Please help me. Please make them stop the train.
Come on. - Do you hear? Why don't you do something before it's too late?
Please.
Please. - I know you think I'm crazy, but I'm not!
I'm not!
For heaven's sake, stop this train!
Now, come - Leave me alone! Leave me alone!
Ten minutes late, thanks to that fool of a girl.
She gets up to any more of her tricks, we shall be too late for the last day of the match.
I suppose you couldn't put it to her in some way.
What?
Well, people... just don't vanish and so forth.
She has.
What?
Vanished.
Who?
The old dame.
Yes.
Well?
Well, how could she?
What?
Vanish.
I don't know.
That just explains my point. People don't just disappear into thin air.
It's done in India.
The rope trick.
It never comes out in a photograph.
Look, now. In half an hour we'll stop at Morsken, just before the border.
I will leave there, with my patient, for the national hospital.
If you will come with me, you could stay overnight in a private ward.
You need peace and rest.
Sorry. Nothing doing.
Isn't there anything we can do?
Yes, find Miss Froy.
I tell you, my friend. If she does not rest, I will not answer for her.
It will be best if you persuade her.
She likes you. Oh, I'm just about as popular as a dose of strychnine.
If you coat it with sugar, she may swallow it.
Cosmopolitan train, this.
People of all nations.
I've just seen at least a million Mexicans in the corridor.
Well, I thought I'd look in to tell you to think over what Dr. Hartz said.
Feel like changing your mind, I'll be hanging around.
What's all the mystery?
You're right. Miss Froy is on this train.
I've just seen the packet of tea that you were talking about. They chucked it out with the rubbish.
Trifle late, aren't you?
She may be dead by now.
Well, dead or - Of course, for sheer variety, give me an English summer.
I remember once spending a bank holiday at Brighton -
We're going to search this train. There's something definitely queer in here.
Looks like supply service for trunk murderers.
Look at that.
All right, Miss Froy.
It's only us.
Well, perhaps it's Miss Froy bewitched.
You never know. Well, anyway, I refuse to be discouraged. Faint heart never found old lady.
By the way, do you know anything about her?
No. Only that she was a governess going back home.
What is this thing?
Can't imagine.
What on earth?
Our Italian friend, that -
Wait a minute. There you are. The Great Doppo.
His visiting card.
Look. - What's it say?
The Great Doppo - magician, illusionist, mind reader - "will visit all the principal towns and cities.
See his, uh, fascinating act, The Vanishing L - Lady."
Vanishing Lady?
Perhaps that's the explanation.
What? - Maybe he's practicing on Miss Froy.
Well, perhaps it's a publicity stunt.
No, I don't think so. That wouldn't account for the baroness or Madame Kummer.
Well, what's your theory?
I'll tell you.
Oh, dear.
I can't get one -
That one - Where are you?
I'm in here, with a strong smell of camphor ball.
I can't see you.
I'm about somewhere.
Here I am.
Where are you?
I don't know.
Ah, this is what comes of not saying "Abracadabra."
Are you hurt?
Come on. Out with it, Oscar.
Not much.
Come sit down over here.
What is that thing?
Well, in magic circles we call it the disappearing cabinet.
You get inside and vanish.
So I noticed. - You were about to tell me of your theory.
Oh, my theory.
Well - My theory, my dear Watson, is that we are in very deep waters indeed.
Thank you very much. Let us marshal our facts over a pipeful of Baker Street shag.
In the first place, a little old lady disappears.
Everyone that saw her promptly insists that she was never there at all.
Right?
Right. We know that she was. Therefore they did see her.
Therefore they are deliberately lying. - Why?
I don't know. I'm only Watson.
Well, don't bury yourself in the part.
I'll tell you why. Because they daren't face an inquiry.
Because Miss Froy is probably still somewhere on this train.
I told you that hours ago.
Oh, yes. So you did.
For that, my dear Watson, you shall have a trichinopoly cigar.
Oh, thank you. Now there's only one thing left to do, you know - search the train in disguise.
As what?
Old English gentleman.
They'd see through you.
Perhaps you're right.
Now... boys, boys. Which of you has stolen Miss Froy?
Own up.
Own up. - Those glasses, give them to me.
Why?
They're Miss Froy's.
You sure?
Yes, they're exactly the same.
Gold rim with - - Where did you find these?
Well, down here on the floor.
The glass is broken. - Well, probably in the struggle.
Pick up the glass.
You realize this is our first piece of really tangible proof?
That's the last.
Will you please give me those spectacles?
They belong to me. - My spectacles, please!
Yours?
Are you sure?
Ah, naughty, naughty.
You know, that's a very large nose for a very small pair of spectacles.
That's the game, is it? Let's see about that!
Those are Miss Froy's glasses, and you know it.
She's been in here, and you know that too.
Don't stand hopping about like a referee.
Cooperate. Kick him.
See if he's got a false bottom.
That doesn't help!
Quick! Pull his ears back! Give 'em a twist.
Look out. He's got a knife!
Quick. Get a hold of it before he cuts a slice off me.
I can't reach it.
Well done.
We know how that thing works. Come out of there.
Is he out, do you think?
Anyway, we've gotta hide him somewhere.
What's in here?
Hurry up quick, before he comes to.
It's empty.
Oh, no, you don't.
What's the matter?
Garlic. I'll be all right in a minute.
Here.
Hold on to this.
Oh, yes. Let's tie him up.
Oh, well. We're getting somewhere at last.
We definitely know that Miss Froy was on this train... and we know our friend here had something to do with it.
That ought to keep him quiet until we find her.
Ah. Hard work, but worth it.
Uh, let's have the evidence.
Evidence? - Yes, the glasses.
You've got them.
No, I haven't got them.
He's got them.
He isn't there!
Snookered.
It's a false bottom.
That twister. He's a contortionist.
He's gone, all right.
Yes, to find the others and make more trouble.
We're in a nasty jam, my dear. - We can't fight the whole train.
We need allies. - Yes, but who can we trust?
That's the snag.
There's that Dr. Hartz person.
Yes, you're right. He might help. Come along.
Let's tell him the symptoms. All right.
This is the one.
He's not there.
I've just had a particularly idiotic idea.
Mmm.
I quite believe that. - But suppose that patient in there is Miss Froy.
Yes, but it didn't come on the train till after Miss Froy disappeared.
Yes, that's why it's an idiotic idea. - Come on.
Let's find the doctor.
Wait a minute. - What is it?
Did you notice anything wrong about that nun?
I don't think she's a nun at all.
They don't wear high heels.
Yes, you're right.
Listen. Did you see Madame Kummer get on the train?
No.
Well, supposing they decoyed Miss Froy into the luggage van and hid her there.
The first stop, the patient comes aboard - head injury, all wrapped up.
The patient is Madame Kummer.
Madame Kummer becomes Miss Froy and Miss Froy becomes... that.
Yes, but why should they go to all this trouble to kidnap a harmless little governess?
Perhaps it isn't a governess at all. Perhaps it's some political thing, you know?
Well, let's investigate.
Parlez-vous français?
Sprechen Sie Deutsch?
Well, you'll just have to put up with it in English.
Can we take a look at your patient, please?
Thank you.
What are you doing here?
This is the most serious accident case.
You have no business to be here at all, neither of you.
Dr. Hartz, we want you to undo those bandages and let us take a look at your patient's face.
Are you out of your senses?
There is no face there.
Nothing but lumps of raw flesh.
Already the case has lost so much blood, nothing but a transfusion can save him.
What do you want me to do? Murder my patient?
You're quite sure that this is your patient?
We believe it's Miss Froy.
You can't be serious.
Whatever put such ideas into your heads?
I understand she's deaf and dumb.
But she may lip-read.
Oh, well, that's possible.
Well, in that case, perhaps you will join me in the dining car?
I'Il be with you in a moment. I want to be certain my patient hasn't been disturbed.
How the devil do I know how they cottoned on?
Somebody must have tipped them off.
You never said the old girl was English.
What difference does that make?
In a few moments, I shall order three drinks in the dining car.
Mine will be Chartreuse. Now, one of the stewards is working for us.
Now listen carefully.
There's that girl again.
Seems to have recovered.
And now, perhaps, you'll tell me what's all about.
Now listen, Doctor. Have you ever actually seen your patient?
No, I merely received a message to pick the case up and operate at Morsken.
How do you know that it's not Miss Froy? - We believe there's been a substitution, Doctor.
You really mean to say that you think that someone -
Oh. Uh, I want a green Chartreuse.
Won't you join me?
Oh, thanks. I'd like a large brandy.
And you?
Oh, I don't want anything.
Oh, come on. It'Il do you good.
No, really.
You're very tired. It will pick you up.
All right, then. Just a small one.
Uh, two brandies and a Chartreuse.
Tell me, do you know anything about the nun who's looking after your patient?
No. Only that she is from a convent close to where the accident occurred.
Don't you think it's rather peculiar that she's wearing high-heeled shoes?
Oh, is she?
Well, that is rather - rather curious, isn't it?
It's a conspiracy. That's all it can be.
all these people on the train say they haven't seen Miss Froy, but they have.
We know that, because just now in the luggage van -
She's off again.
Hope she doesn't create another scene.
Put the lid on our getting back in time, if she did.
And then this fellow from the carriage - Doppo's his name -
He came along and grabbed the glasses.
Yeah. We went for him and had a bit of a fight.
Oh, a fight?
Mm-hmm.
He seems to have made a speedy recovery.
Yes.
Here.
Oh, but how could he be involved in a conspiracy?
Look at him, the poor fellow. He's just a harmless traveler.
He's also a music hall artist making a tour of Bandrika.
Well? - Well, the baroness's husband is minister of propaganda.
One word from her and his tour would be canceled.
Oh, I see.
As for the stewards, if they don't do what they're told... they've got a nice cozy brick wall to lean up against.
Well, that's just what stumps us, but all we know is that she was here on this train... and now she's... gone. But - But
Tell me about... the two English travelers. They-They also denied seeing her.
Yes. Just British diplomacy, Doctor.
Never climb a fence if you can sit on it." It's an old Foreign Office proverb.
What I cannot understand is, why should anyone want to dispose of the old lady?
Yes.
Well, if you're right, it means the whole train is against us.
Well, what are we going to do?
Well, in view of what you just told me, l-l-l shall risk examining the patient.
Wait a minute, however - But one moment. Uh, we mustn't act suspicious.
Behave as if nothing had happened.
That'Il steady your nerves.
To our health... and may our enemies, if they exist, be unconscious of our purpose.
Let's go. We must hurry now.
Come on.
Wait in here.
Anything wrong?
Nothing... except they noticed you were wearing high heels.
However, it makes no difference.
We shall reach Morsken in three minutes.
Quite an eventful journey.
Well?
Yes. The patient is Miss Froy.
She will be taken off the train at Morsken, in about three minutes.
She will be removed to the hospital there and operated on.
Unfortunately, the operation will not be successful.
Oh, I should perhaps have explained.
The operation will be performed... by me.
You see, I am in this, uh, conspiracy, as you term it.
You are a very alert young couple... but it's quite useless for you to think, as you are undoubtedly doing, of a way out of your dilemma.
The drinks you had just now, I regret to say, contained a quantity of Hydrocin.
For your benefit, Hydrocin is a very little-known drug... which has the effect, in a small quantity, of paralyzing the brain... and rendering the victim unconscious for a considerable period.
In a slightly larger quantity, of course, it induces madness.
However, you have my word the dose was a normal one.
In a very few moments now, you will join your young friend.
Need I say how sorry I am, having to take such a -
How shall I say - melodramatic course?
But your persistent meddling made it necessary.
You all right?
You must have fainted.
Did I? Listen.
There's a woman next door going to be murdered... and we've got to get moving before this stuff takes effect.
I did read once that if you keep on the go, you can stay awake.
Right. Come on.
It's locked.
We can't go that way.
You can't do that!
Don't worry. It's only next door.
You carry on keeping fit - uh, touch your toes, stand on your head.
Do anything, only whatever you do, don't fall asleep.
Go on. You needn't be afraid.
It is Miss Froy.
It's all right. You haven't been drugged.
He told me to put something in your drink, but I didn't do it.
What the devil are you?
He said you were deaf and dumb.
Oh, never mind about that now.
If you want to save her, you've got to hurry.
Hartz will be back in a minute. What's gonna happen then?
If we can hold them off till we get past Morsken... the frontier's a few miles beyond the station.
No, come on. There's still time.
That's Morsken.
You finished?
Come on, Miss Froy.
Cut it out, kid. You're not drugged. I'Il explain later.
Abracadabra.
Miss Froy!
Oh. - Oh, I can't believe it!
Thank you, my dear.
Thank you very much. - Careful!
Ready?
You all right, Miss Froy?
Yes, thank you. It's rather like the rush hour on the underground.
Look.
I'm sorry you've had such an uncomfortable journey, Miss Froy.
Get back on the train.
I hope nothing goes wrong.
Aren't we stopping rather a long time?
The ambulance is going. We'll be off in a jiffy.
Another couple of minutes, we'Il be over the border.
I know I've been well paid, and I've done plenty of dirty work for it... but this was murder and...
sh-she was an Englishwoman.
You are Bandriekan?
My husband was, but I'm English... and you were going to butcher her in cold blood.
Your little diversion made it necessary not only to remove the lady in question... but two others as well.
You can't do that.
Also, it would be unwise of us... to permit the existence of anyone who cannot be trusted.
You wouldn't dare. I know too much.
Precisely.
I think we're over the border now.
You can come out, Miss Froy.
Oh. Oh, bless me. - What an unpleasant journey.
Never mind. - You shall have a corner seat for the rest of the way.
Okay. - Ah.
There you are. Okay.
Now that it's over, I think you ought to tell us what it's all about.
What was that scream?
Surely it was only the train whistle.
It was a woman.
They've rumbled. We're on a branchline and they've slipped the rear part of the train.
Oh, dear.
Oh, dear. - Look here. Who are you... and why are these people going to these lengths to get hold of you?
I haven't the faintest idea.
I - I'm a children's governess, you know.
I can only think they've made some terrible mistake.
Why are you holding out on us?
Tell us the truth! You got us involved in this fantastic plot, you might at least trust us.
I really don't know.
I wonder if there's anybody else left on the train.
Well, there's only the dining car in front, but there won't be anybody there now.
What do you make it?
Teatime. Well, all the English will be there.
We'd better stick together.
There's the old girl turned up.
Told you it was a lot of fuss about nothing.
Bolt must have jammed.
I've got something to say. Will you all please listen?
An attempt has been made to abduct this lady by force.
I've got reason to believe that the people who did it are going to try again.
What's the fellow driveling about?
If you don't believe me, you can look out of the window.
This train's been diverted onto a branchline.
What are you talking about?
Abductions, diverted trains -
We're telling you the truth!
I'm not in the least interested.
Y-You've annoyed us enough with your ridiculous story.
My dear chap, you must have got hold of the wrong end of the stick somewhere.
Yes.
Things like that just don't happen. - We're not in England now.
I don't see what difference that makes.
Do you see those cars?
They're here to take Miss Froy away.
Nonsense.
There go a couple of people.
The cars have obviously come to pick them up.
In that case, why go to the trouble of uncoupling the train and diverting it?
Uncoupling?
There's nothing left of the train beyond the sleeping car.
There must be. Our bags are in the first-class carriage.
Not any longer.
Would you like to come and look?
If this is a practical joke, I warn you, I shan't think it very funny.
Good Lord!
Let's have some of that brandy.
You don't suppose there's something in this, uh, fellow's story, Caldicott, do you?
Seems a bit queer.
I mean, after all, people don't go about tying up nuns.
Someone's coming!
They can't possibly do anything to us.
I have come to offer the most sincere apologies.
An extremely serious incident has occurred.
An attempt has been made to interfere with passengers on this train.
Fortunately, it was brought to the notice of the authorities... and so if you will be good enough to accompany me to Morsken...
I will inform the British embassy at once.
Ladies and gentlemen, the cars are at your disposal.
We're very grateful. It's lucky some of you fellows understand English.
Well, I was at Oxford.
Really? So was I. What year?
Hold on. This woman seems to be trying to say something.
I don't understand the language and it may be important.
That's fixed him.
That's all right. He's only stunned.
What the blazes did you do that for?
Well, I was at Cambridge.
What's that got to do with it? You heard what he said, didn't you?
I heard what she said.
That was a trick to get us off the train.
I don't believe it. The man's explanation was quite satisfactory.
Thing like this might cause a war.
I'm going outside, tell them what's occurred.
It's up to us to apologize and put the matter right.
You were right.
Do you mind, old man?
Certainly.
Look as if they mean business.
I'm afraid so.
They can't do anything. It would mean an international situation.
It's happened before.
They're coming.
Don't let them in!
They'll murder us.
They daren't let us go now.
I order you to surrender at once.
Nothing doing. Come any nearer, I'll fire.
I've warned you.
Better take cover.
They'Il start any minute now.
Nasty jam, this. Don't like the look of it.
Got plenty of ammunition?
Whole pouch full. - Good.
Duck down, you!
I'm not gonna fight.
It's madness.
Hello. They're trying to work round to the other side.
You're behaving like a pack of fools!
What chance have we got against a lot of armed men?
You heard what the mother superior said.
We surrender now, we're in for it.
We'Il never get to the match now.
Give it to me.
No.
Give it to me!
What's going on here? - He's got a gun and he won't use it.
What's the idea?
Well, I told you. I won't be a party to this sort of thing.
I don't believe in fighting!
Pacifist, eh? Won't work, old boy. Early Christians tried it and got thrown to the lions.
Come on. Hand it over.
I'm not afraid to use it.
Probably more used to it.
I once won a box of cigars. He's talking rot. He's a damn good shot.
Hope the old hand hasn't lost its cunning.
You know, I'm half inclined to believe... that there's some rational explanation to all this.
Rotten.
Do you mind if I talk to you for a minute?
What, now?
Yes, I
Please forgive me, but it's very important.
Hang on to this for me, will you?
All right.
I'll hold the fort. - I think it's safer along here.
You come too.
I just wanted to tell you... that I must be getting along now.
But you can't!
You'll never get away.
You'll be shot down.
I must take that risk.
Listen carefully. In case I'm unlucky and you get through...
I want you to take back a message to a Mr. Callendar at the Foreign Office in Whitehall.
Then you are a spy.
I always think that's such a grim word.
Well, what is the message?
It's a tune.
Tune?
It contains - in code, of course - the vital clause of a secret pact between two European countries.
I want you to memorize it.
Well, go ahead. The first part of it goes like this -
Oh, perhaps I'd better write it down. Have you got a piece of paper?
No, don't bother. I was brought up on music.
I can memorize anything.
Very well. - Hello. The old girl's gone off her rocker.
I don't wonder.
Why don't you face it? Those swine out there will go on firing till they've killed the lot of us.
For goodness' sake. Shut up, Eric.
Now we've got two chances instead of one.
You bet.
You sure you'll remember it? Oh, don't worry.
I won't stop whistling it.
I suppose this is my best way out.
Yes, just about.
But you may be hit, and even if you do get away, they'll stop you at the frontier.
We can't let her go like this!
This is a hell of a risk you're taking.
In this sort of job, one must take risks.
I'm very grateful to you both for all you've done.
I do hope and pray no harm will come to you... and that we shall all meet again...
one day. - I hope so too.
Good luck.
Good luck.
Will you help me?
Now you take the weight on this.
Hold your shirt.
Good-bye.
Was she hit?
I'm not sure.
Well, that's the end of my 12.
Listen.
We've only got one chance now.
We've got to get this train going, drive it back to the main line and then try and cross the frontier.
That's a bit of a tall order, isn't it? Those driver fellows are not likely to do as you tell them.
We'll bluff them with this.
Who's coming? - You can count on me.
Me too.
Well, we can't all go. You stay here and carry on.
If we have any luck, we'll stop the train when we reach the points.
You jump out and switch them over.
Okay. You idiots.
You're just inviting death.
I've had enough.
Just because I have the sense to try and avoid being murdered, I'm accused of being a pacifist.
I'd rather be called a rat than die like one.
Think for a moment, will you?
If we give ourselves up, they daren't murder us in cold blood.
They're bound to give us a trial.
Stop jibbering, Eric. Nobody's listening to you.
Very well.
You go your way.
I'Il go mine.
Hey, where you off to?
I know what I'm about. - I'm doing the only sensible thing.
Oh, let the fellow go if he wants to.
You don't understand.
No, please.
Why aren't we going? Why aren't we going?
They said we were going.
Why aren't we? If only he can get us away now.
He must! There's only one left.
They're moving away from the cars.
Pity we haven't a few more rounds.
It's funny.
I told my husband, when I left him, that I wouldn't see him again.
Gilbert. Gilbert!
By gad, we're off.
This gives us a chance.
Go on.
Do you know how to control this thing?
I watched the fellow start it.
Anyway, I know something about it. - Once drove a miniature engine on the Dymchurch line.
Good.
The blighters are chasing us.
We can't have far to go.
It's time for my little job changing the points.
Thank heavens we shall be in neutral territory.
That will not be necessary.
I'm sorry, but the points, as you call them, will not be changed over.
Will you please be seated.
There they are, just ahead of us.
Think you can stop it?
Keep quite still until my friends arrive.
If anyone moves, I'm afraid I shall have to shoot.
There's just one thing you don't know, Captain.
There's only one bullet left in that gun, and if you shoot me, you'll give the others a chance.
You're in rather a difficult position, aren't you?
Sit down, please.
All right.
Where the devil's Charters?
Go ahead!
Oh!
It's all right.
Or as they say in English, jolly good luck to them.
My word, I'm glad all that's over, aren't you?
Heaven knows what the government will say about all this.
Nothing at all.
They'll hush it up. - What?
Hey, take your hand off that thing.
I've got to remember a tune.
Porter, sir?
Uh, no, thanks.
Well, we're home, Gilbert. Can't you stop humming that awful tune?
You must know it backwards.
I'm not taking any risks.
Charles be here to meet you?
♪♪ Well, you'll be pretty busy between now and Thursday.
I could meet you for lunch or dinner, if you'd like it.
I didn't mean that. I - No, as a matter of fact, I've got to deliver this theme song for Miss Froy.
When I've done that, I'm gonna dash off to Yorkshire and finish my book.
I see.
Ready?
Ample time to catch the 6:50 to Manchester after all.
Any sign of Charles yet?
Well, this is where we say good-bye.
Oh, what's the matter?
Charles?
Yes, you heartless, callous, selfish, swollen-headed beast.
Are you going anywhere?
Foreign Office.
Where are we going for our honeymoon?
I don't know. Somewhere quiet.
Somewhere where there are no trains.
Wait a minute.
It's gone.
What's gone?
The tune.
I've forgotten it. - No.
Oh, no! Wait a minute.
That's "The Wedding March."
This is awful! I've done nothing else but sing it since the day before yesterday, and - and now I've forgotten it completely.
Miss Froy. - Well, I'll be had.
Going to Le Havre?
Yeah. get in.
Thanks.
Tired?
Yes.
Are you on leave?
You're not very talkative.
No, not very.
Cigarette?
Thanks.
We're here.
What? - Le Havre.
Ah, yes. Le Havre.
This is some fog!
I know all about fogs. I was in Tonkin.
You must be joking.
It's not foggy in Tonkin.
Not foggy?
Yes, it is. In here.
Are you mad, swerving to save a dog?
A dog's a dog.
And my bones are my bones.
Got yellow fever? Then take quinine.
You might be in the army but I'm the boss in my truck.
Your truck, your bones!
If you don't like it, get out and I'll rattle those bones of yours.
All right, I will.
Are we really going to fight over a dog?
Don't think I'm chickening out.
I could easily take a hold of you and head-butt you.
So much for your spanner!
I only grabbed it in case you tried to shoot.
Shoot?
You don't know what you're talking about.
Give me a cigarette.
Shooting might look easy.
Like shooting clay pipes at the fair.
You shoot and then... a man screams
and grabs hold of his belly, making a face like...
Like a kid who's eaten too much.
His hands turn red.
Then he falls.
And you're left all alone, not understanding a thing.
It's as if the ground had fallen away.
Anyway...
Thanks for the lift. Here.
No hard feelings?
Of course not.
Bye.
Want the packet?
What about you?
I've got more.
Well, in that case...
Bye.
Good luck.
It's a laugh a minute tonight.
Will he be long?
I don't know.
You never know anything.
Coming to dance, Lucien?
I told you to wait at the bar. We're talking.
I came here because you asked me to but I hate places like this.
I find this music so dreadful.
I like classical music.
We know what kind of music you like, Zabel.
You know nothing.
You're just petty crooks.
That's right, make us laugh.
Act the fool.
Funny, isn't he?
Sure, if you say so.
You even make the orphan laugh.
And he's not normally cheerful.
You make us laugh. It's a fact.
You can pretend to laugh but you should be ashamed of the life you lead.
Your parents are respectable people. But you lead the life of a gangster.
It's so demoralising.
And to think you learned to play the piano!
Listen, it's all very well acting the fool for five minutes, but enough's enough.
Where's Maurice?
Yes, good old Maurice!
No idea. He used to drop in once in a while.
But once I saw he was a crook like you, I asked him to space out his visits.
That's all.
This music!
Maurice has disappeared and since I've fallen out with him...
Over a woman, no doubt.
That or something else.
Anyway, people think I'm involved.
And deep down that flatters you, right?
But you're worried it might cause you trouble so you'd like to know.
Precisely.
I'm sure you know a lot.
Yes, a lot!
You're wrong, my dears. I don't know a thing.
And don't get so familiar.
I'm old enough to be your father and I'm an honest merchant.
We're pretty rare these days.
You invited me here so I'll let you pay.
Madam, my hat and coat, please.
He makes fun of us and then off he goes!
Let him go.
We'll go and see him later.
What for?
Just to see.
I told you to get lost!
Can't you be polite?
I'm asking you how much the rooms cost?
You're dressed up like an admiral so you can help the customers.
Just tell me what the rooms cost.
I'm telling you, this is not a hotel!
So you won't say what the rooms cost?
It's not for tonight because I'm skint.
But maybe tomorrow or another night I could...
Get lost or this could turn nasty!
Sorry.
No harm done.
What a brute! - Who?
The admiral.
Leave me in peace. I'm in a hurry.
But it's not every night I meet a friend.
I don't love soldiers. I just feel sorry for them.
I might have been a soldier if I hadn't come a cropper the day I got called up.
Are you going to leave me alone?
Are you a brute too?
No, I just want to be left alone.
Now I see.
I get it.
Do you have to be so clingy?
Is that your dog?
No.
If you're looking for a quiet spot, I might be able to help you.
The trouble is, I'm skint.
That doesn't matter. I'll take you to Panama's.
What's Panama's?
Panama's? It's the quietest spot on the coast.
For a seaside resort, it's the best you can find.
Four walls, a door and a roof on top.
My dream is...
If you dream standing up, you'll fall over.
Never mind.
Here we are.
It's that place lit up over there.
My dream is to sleep just once between clean, white sheets.
A top sheet and a bottom sheet.
Your dog's back.
I told you, he's not mine.
Get lost, will you?
I've got no dog, nothing.
Don't you like dogs?
Not one that's looking for a master.
Have you found a master?
Not yet.
Who is it?
Half Pint.
Open up. I'm not alone.
Come in.
Good evening.
Want a drink?
I'm not thirsty. I just need some rest.
Besides, I can't afford a drink.
That doesn't matter. Make yourself at home.
But I'm warning you, don't try telling me some sob story about the fog, your troubles and your problems.
There's no fog here, only fair weather.
The hands are nailed down, so... any personal stuff...
Calm down. I'm not the talkative type.
Well, I am, but I'm discreet.
What do you think of this one?
It's a real one.
I bought it in Panama, in 1906.
It cuts America in half.
You cross it by boat and you're down below looking up at monkeys in the sky.
Blue monkeys.
It's wonderful.
Tired?
A little.
Forgive me.
Tired or not, it's none of my business.
Usually, I never ask questions.
No harm done.
Leave that alone, you idiot!
The crew will come unglued.
You've already swallowed the cabin boy.
Panama, 1906.
32 years in the bottle and you want to gulp it down!
When I'm thirsty...
Hell, all I want is...
I know. To sleep in clean sheets.
Hi, Panama.
Michel.
You've got a crowd in tonight.
Yeah, high society!
People are what they are.
Pretty awful, pretty criminal.
But there are pretty things too.
You should paint them.
Paint them?
I've tried painting flowers, young women, children...
It was like painting crime with all that entails.
I'd see crime in a rose.
It's called painting with a knife!
What could be simpler than a tree?
And yet when I paint one, I make everyone ill at ease.
There's always something or someone hidden behind the tree.
I paint things hidden behind other things.
To me, a swimmer is already a drowned man.
Whenever I try to paint gaiety, music, a dance or an outdoor wedding, on my canvas I find only hatred, jealousy, murder and cemeteries.
Still lives!
Be quiet, you idiot!
No, I'm the idiot.
Only an idiot can live this way with such anguish.
Don't you think so?
I think you're complicated.
But... Things will work out.
I've come full circle.
Are you still considering suicide?
Some people go fishing some go hunting, some go to war.
Others commit crimes of passion.
And some commit suicide. You have to kill someone.
That's life for you!
Take your drinking, for instance, you drink to kill the pain.
Me?
I drink to get drunk.
It amounts to the same thing.
As for you, I'm sure that if I did your portrait...
Leave me alone!
Your hands in your pockets, at night in the fog...
I've had enough of this!
You and your fancy talk!
It's getting on my nerves.
Have you been drinking too?
Shut up. What do you know?
I get upset and you insist that I've been drinking.
I haven't.
I just haven't eaten for two days.
There's a sign on my belly that says "cold storage".
Didn't they feed you in the army?
What's it to you?
You should have said you were hungry. It's not hard.
I know. When you're hungry you ask for food.
Only I shut up out of pride.
I'm proud. Funny, that.
People say I'm headstrong. They're right. I am headstrong.
And you're hard-headed too!
You said you were hungry.
I am.
Come on, then.
There's bread, sausage and some Chester cheese.
In Panama I always bought Chester.
If you haven't eaten for a while, you should eat slowly.
Aren't you going to tell me to enjoy my food?
Have you forgotten your manners?
You again!
Perhaps you're hungry too.
Is he yours?
Yes.
He's got a nice face.
So have you.
You're pretty and I like you.
You're skinny but I like you.
It's like in the movies, I see you and I like you.
It's love at first sight.
I'm love-struck.
You know that little chap with wings on his back and arrows?
Hearts on trees.
Romance that ends in tears.
You're all the same. You play dirty tricks on us.
Do you really think that?
What?
What you say about love.
You girls are all the same.
You tout your wares, but really you're after romance.
What did you say? We tout our wares?
Yes.
Have you never heard the expression before?
You tout your wares, you hustle.
Why do you talk to me like that?
Come off it! Don't tell me you came here to bring your granny a cake, like Little Red Riding Hood.
Pity, because...
I'm the big bad wolf.
And the big bad wolf is not very clever.
Do you think khaki suits me?
Tell me...
Why do you keep laughing like that?
It's not a real laugh. It's sad.
Have you ever seen a woman fall in love with a soldier?
Women love a soldier when he's on parade.
But when a uniformed soldier shows up on his own, you should see the look on their faces then.
I don't even know why I'm telling you this.
Men and women can't get along.
They don't speak the same language.
They don't use the same vocabulary.
Maybe so, but they can still love one another.
Have you ever loved anyone?
Not really.
Well, then?
What's that?
I don't know.
What was that?
Just some bad boys.
I picked a quiet spot to get away from them and they come here to kill one another.
Your lighting is like the catacombs.
Well?
Well!
Most unfortunate.
How could you lose him?
He'll be hiding in that shack.
What shack?
The bar over there.
That dump?
Get in!
I'm sure he's here.
Then let's go and get him.
Open up.
We're dying of thirst.
We're closed.
If you don't open up, we'll come in anyway.
Shall we bash the door in?
First warning shot. Fired in the air, like in Panama.
The next one's for you.
They're going to shoot.
Are you afraid of the gunfire?
I wish that was all.
What else is there?
I can't tell you.
Don't be afraid. I'm here.
You're sweet.
What's your name?
Nelly.
I'm Jean.
The bastards!
A real naval battle! Wonderful!
The captain's all alone on board.
I think they got the message.
What a lovely night!
Indeed. Hey!
This looks like blood.
Blood?
What are you doing there?
Are you wounded?
I must have cut my hand when I fell.
May I come in?
Come in.
Life is a curious thing, at least what you see of it between midnight and 3am.
That man mustn't see me here.
I don't want too many people to see me either.
They were after me like a pack of wolves.
I got away but it was a close call.
give me some rum, boss.
There's no rum here.
But you can wash your hands.
Ah, yes, my hands.
Blood stains clothes but it washes off hands easily.
Have you ever noticed how doctors, surgeons in particular, have white, well-kept hands?
Yet they paddle in blood all day long.
I'm not a doctor.
I sell cut-price trinkets.
Nobody asked you what you did.
There's some rainwater outside in the bucket.
As you wish.
Are you an artist?
I wish I was.
I love the arts.
Classical music, especially religious music.
It brings back memories.
I love sifting through my memories.
Family memories, childhood memories.
Where's your wound?
I can't see it.
I must have been mistaken.
And now I've lost my parcel.
My parcel. That is upsetting.
So that wasn't your blood?
I don't know who you are. It's none of my business.
It's dawn. You can go now.
You've got a face I don't like.
Some faces are likeable, some aren't.
It's unimportant. A face doesn't amount to much.
It carries so little weight.
Mine pleases nobody, but believe it or not, when I look in a mirror, I like it.
Better to have this face than none at all, right?
Each time the sun rises, we think something new will happen, something fresh.
Then the sun goes to bed and so do we.
It's sad.
Did you mean what you said earlier?
What?
About love.
I wouldn't have said it otherwise.
You might have said it to soften up a customer.
A customer?
Sorry to disturb you.
Nothing like a cold shower to perk a fellow up.
Now I'm fresh as a daisy and ready for work.
You work?
Yes, down at the docks.
This holds two litres.
Each morning I swipe two litres to sell at night.
It's illegal, of course, but I'm the only one who recorks the barrel.
It's a simple question of professional honesty.
Bye, then.
Excuse me, lovely lady, but work is work.
Staying here?
No.
Where are you going?
I don't know.
We're going the same way, then.
Do you like life?
What?
You like life, don't you?
Yes, on certain days.
Does life like you?
So far it's been pretty mean, but... that may change since I like it.
Thanks for your hospitality. You've been great.
Thank you for keeping me company.
If I can help in any way...
Help me?
Perhaps you could find me some civvies.
I see. So you're on permanent leave?
I thought you didn't ask questions.
Yes, but...
This is my only suit and I like it.
Come back tonight and I might have something.
Thanks. I will.
What's your shoe size?
Seven and a half. Why?
No reason.
Coming?
Sometimes luck strikes.
Luck?
He's a seven and a half, like me.
He needs clothes, I have some.
He wants a new life, but... he needs a pass.
Yes, he needs a new identity. That's obvious.
He's in luck. I have one going spare. - Oh?
My own. If he can use it...
I'm going swimming.
The sea's rough and it's foggy.
What?
I'm just stating the facts. The sea is rough and it's foggy.
And that's fine by me.
I swim pretty badly.
Even so, I'm going to swim out as far as possible.
What do you want me to say?
Nothing.
Michel!
Don't do anything stupid.
What good will it do?
What a fog!
What awful weather!
Shoes.
Bottle tops, an old comb.
The seabed's vast.
That's not the seabed.
The seabed's further out and deeper.
You talk like a deep-sea diver.
How old are you?
17.
Me too...
I was 17 once.
That's funny.
What?
Look at Nelly.
Where?
There, with a soldier.
Curious.
I thought we were going for coffee?
We're going to have some fun.
I'm going to Panama's tonight. Come along.
I will if I can.
Got any money?
Why? Do you want some?
You don't have any. Yesterday you were hungry.
Why do you ask, then?
Hi.
Come here a minute.
What do you want?
Nothing.
We were just passing.
I came over to say hello.
And to ask for news of Maurice.
You must know something.
I know nothing. Leave me alone.
I see you've already forgotten Maurice and found a replacement?
Great.
You'll go out with anybody but you turn me down.
Why?
I think you're pretty.
You've got a pretty mouth.
I like it.
Don't touch me!
You don't want to be touched?
Did Maurice never touch you?
What about the others?
What about him?
Everybody except me!
Leave me alone.
Instead of hanging out at the Petit Tabarin, you should stay in the shop with your guardian.
By the way, when you see Zabel, tell him from me that last night's fun was just a warning.
That business disgusts me.
Do I disgust you too?
You too. You especially.
Me especially, eh?
Leave her alone like she asked you to.
Take my advice, go and toss some stones in the water.
You soldiers are easily pleased.
You spit in the water and you're happy as Larry.
You can still leave her alone.
He's the calm type.
A master of self-control.
There are three of us and you're on your own.
Three?
Can't you count?
You must be counting on the big man because you two don't amount to much.
Whatever. Come with me.
Leave her alone!
A simple soldier dishing out orders?
Get lost, will you?
Sorry, I'm a bit rough.
It was just a joke.
Leaving, are you?
In a hurry now?
Stay away from me. Don't hit me.
Don't hit me. I'm warning you...
Watch it!
Watch what?
Lost your nerve all of a sudden, have you?
You've turned pale. You don't look too good.
Next time you see me coming, I suggest you cross the street.
Otherwise you'll have this coming to you.
Come on!
Are you getting in or not?
Lucien looks like he's going to cry.
So much for having fun!
Why did you do that?
You don't know if I'm worth it.
I thought you were in a hurry.
I don't know. I ran away.
If I go back, it will be awful. If I don't, it will be the same.
I should go back too.
But if I did, like you say, it would be awful.
Goodbye, Jean.
I'll come to Panama's tonight if I can.
Goodbye.
It's me.
Listen.
It's beautiful.
Shut up!
You make fun of all that is fine and beautiful.
You've laughed at us enough. It's over.
Are you drunk or on drugs?
I'm sick of being humiliated.
I'm a man. Do you hear me?
I'm a man and I'll prove it.
Right now!
Put that away. We came here to talk.
Reckless youth!
Give me the papers, all of them.
Tell us where Maurice is.
I bet you've bumped him off.
What a thing to say.
What were you doing down by the water with those parcels?
Answer me, or else...
Or else what?
I'll show you who I am.
I'll prove to you that I'm somebody.
I know who you are.
You're Lucien Lagardier, from a fine family but ill-bred.
Too much pocket money and yet never enough.
You struck some deals and got into trouble so you came to old Zabel to ask him to bail you out.
You're an ungrateful boy.
I've helped you out before.
Last night you tried to run me over and shoot me.
I don't know where Maurice is.
But the papers concerning you are in safe keeping.
Were it god's will for me to die a violent death, you would all be in big trouble.
You came here to scare me and you haven't succeeded.
It's true. They came here to scare me.
To scare me!
You little worms!
Don't you realise I can't even scare myself?
Shut him up!
Shut him up or I'll kill him.
I'll shoot you, I swear it.
What good would that do?
Let me go.
Come on.
Go out the back way.
One day I'll prove I'm somebody. - What's got into him?
A soldier taught him a lesson earlier.
It was about Nelly.
Really?
Lucien tried to talk to her.
The soldier punched Babe and slapped Lucien.
What did Lucien do?
Nothing.
Nothing? These soldiers are admirable.
Why are you telling me this? Lucien is your friend.
Friends come and go.
Expecting someone for lunch?
Yes, my goddaughter.
Think she'll come back?
She always comes back.
Here she is now. go.
Goodbye.
You fly off like a swallow.
You desert your old guardian.
You leave him all alone, worried sick.
Why did you run off the other night?
I was scared.
You're such a baby. Why come back, then?
The others scare me too.
Where else can I go?
Don't you like it here?
Aren't I good to you?
You're still a little girl and yet you're a little lady too.
Don't look at me like that!
Where were you last night?
Nowhere. I went for a walk.
And found a regiment.
Soldiers are handsome, aren't they?
Is it sailing soon?
Tomorrow.
Where to?
Venezuela, I think.
Want something?
No, just looking.
Stay there. You must be tired.
Can I help you?
I'd like the little box in the window.
I'd like "Jean and Nelly" engraved on it.
And today's date.
Jean and Nelly? That's nice.
It's good to be sentimental.
People are so hard-hearted these days.
This man has a gift for you.
I'll make you a gift of your gift to Nelly.
Any friend of my goddaughter's is a friend of mine.
Do you like animals?
They don't like me much.
May I help you?
We'd like some postcards.
Did you follow me here?
No.
I looked in the window and came in.
Why did you want to buy me a souvenir?
To get rid of some spare cash. I don't accept money from women.
Men, women, what difference does it make?
Sorry. Business is business.
I hope you'll have coffee with us.
No, thanks. I have to...
Please. Such politeness in a soldier is unheard of.
Come along.
I suppose you're on leave.
You're not from round here.
I bet you're from Paris.
Yes.
That's obvious.
Sit down.
Everyone's welcome here.
Are you here to see family?
Nelly, fetch a bottle of cognac from the cellar.
She's a nice girl, isn't she?
She runs away from time to time, but it's nothing serious.
Her mother was like that too.
Short escapades but nothing serious.
Then one day she left and never came back.
The girl stayed with her father.
He was a fine man but he died.
More coffee?
It's better than your average cup.
Do you like the army?
I get to travel.
Have you been in Le Havre long?
Since yesterday.
Pretty town, isn't it?
Nelly, what is it?
Nelly!
Don't touch me. Leave me alone!
I need to talk to you.
What do you want from him?
You have a fever. Come and lie down.
I'll take you to your room.
She's so sensitive. The slightest thing upsets her.
You were at Panama's last night.
What of it?
I didn't see you but I saw your dog.
He growled at me.
Nelly was there too, wasn't she?
I don't answer questions I don't like.
No one who spends the night there has a clear conscience.
Really?
That goes for me as well as you.
Do you have a good memory for numbers?
I do.
Take this number, for example.
36-14.
I only saw it once but I remember it.
What?
It's your army serial number.
I saw it on your shirt earlier.
So?
So this.
I'm very discreet about people who do me a favour.
And people who don't?
That depends.
You did me a favour without knowing it.
By slapping Lucien Lagardier.
Who?
This morning down by the docks.
I'm well informed.
What I don't see, I guess.
You didn't come to Le Havre by chance.
That's none of your business.
Perhaps, but I'm interested.
You came here because of the ships.
You're in trouble and you want to leave in search of a new life.
I can help you leave.
I don't want anything.
I have money if you want.
I can get you ID, a passport.
Lucien Lagardier is an immoral good-for-nothing.
He's threatening me and he'll stop at nothing.
So?
I do you a favour, you do me one.
Everyone's happy.
At night Lucien goes down by the water.
You're there. You push him. He falls in.
Child's play!
Whenever a rogue disappears, society breathes a little easier.
Think it over.
Is that right?
I've thought it over.
Listen... In Tonkin I once saw a limp, gooey bug.
Just seeing it wiggle made me want to puke.
It was a scolopendra.
You remind me of it, with your slimy voice.
You sound as if you're wading through slime.
My voice is odd but so are you.
I am the way I am.
I've only ever stepped out of line when I've been angry.
Whenever anything good happens, scum like you come and mess it up.
You disgust me but I don't like squashing bugs.
Come on.
I was watching. Jean, be careful.
Of your guardian?
Yes.
I can see why you want to get out of that place.
Can I see you tonight?
Where?
Anywhere.
The fair on the dock.
Fairs are big places.
This is a small one.
I'll meet you at the carousel with the white rabbits.
What time?
Nine.
This is some pair of shoes!
So that's why he asked my size.
And I yelled at the poor man.
It's a shame he left before I could thank him.
Do you know where he went?
People come and go.
We're all just passing through.
All the same, I feel lucky.
I'm not normally so lucky but today...
I'm a lucky devil.
Funny how light a hat can feel when you're not used to it.
It's so light.
The trousers are a bit tight but...
They have side tabs. I can adjust them.
Nice cloth.
He must be rich to give these away.
No doubt.
He left this for you too.
Money?
850 francs.
850?
And that's not all.
What for?
He thought you might need it.
He thought...
I didn't ask for anything.
How did he guess?
Guess what?
That I wanted to leave.
What about him?
He won't be needing it.
Really?
He's not bothered. So if it will help you...
Michel Kraus.
Height: 5'8.
Medium-sized nose, brown hair.
Funny how all men look alike on paper.
You'll have to change the picture.
That's easily done.
And fix the stamp and the signature.
That's easy too.
If no one has come for this in a year and a day, it's yours.
Thanks.
I'm no good with words, so...
Come on.
Don't forget your paint box.
Your name's Michel Kraus and you're an artist.
Yes.
That's right.
goodbye. - goodbye.
When do you sail?
Tomorrow at five.
For Venezuela?
Yes.
Pretty, isn't it?
The ships, the sea, the sailors...
Everything's pretty to an artist.
I've been watching you. It's easy to spot a painter's eye.
I was almost a painter myself.
I had paint in my blood.
Then I did a medical degree. Utter madness.
You're looking at the doctor in spite of himself!
Dr. Mollet, doctor on board the Louisiana.
Michel Kraus.
Will you have a drink with me?
I'm in a hurry.
I have a lot to do too.
I sail tomorrow but I still have time for a drink.
You sail tomorrow?
For Venezuela.
Come along if you like. She's a good ship.
You'd be comfortable.
For a painter travel is a source of renewal.
Do you take passengers?
Seriously?
You'd really like to come?
Why not?
There's nothing keeping me here.
As long as it's not too expensive.
I know you artists aren't wealthy.
Come on.
Big decisions are best made over a glass of something.
Hi!
You look happy. good day?
You bet! Two litres of the best.
Where are you off to?
Hello.
What's it to be?
A room. - A room?
Right away.
What about my rum?
Coming right up.
Want something?
Yes, give me a shot.
Of what?
A small shot of rum.
In a big glass!
It's just a formality.
You artists are all bohemians.
My papers are in order. My passport...
Perfect. I'll arrange everything with the captain.
You can tell me if you like my watercolours.
Watercolours?
Are you a landscape painter?
I don't go in for theories.
You're not a cubist?
A cubist?
No.
Just as well, because I find cubism...
What do you paint?
In general... I paint things that are hidden behind things.
Very interesting.
For example, if I see a swimmer,
I think he's going to drown. So I paint a drowning man.
Your painting doesn't sound very cheerful.
As long as it's well painted.
Never mind the subject matter.
Good health!
Boss, another shot to keep these company.
Are you going to take that room or not?
Ah, yes, the room.
How much is it?
18 francs.
And what do I owe you?
18 francs.
I'll pay up, then.
What about the room?
The room?
Too late. good night.
And be on time. Ships don't wait for you.
Do you have much luggage?
Very little, just one suitcase.
One suitcase? - Yes.
You're leaving for Venezuela with one suitcase?
How wonderful!
Just as I imagine an artist to be.
No baggage, independence, freedom.
It's good to be free.
Yes, it is.
I'm sure you plan to return.
I mean...
Aren't you involved with anyone?
No.
No one.
Don't move.
One... two... three.
Thank you.
The journey's over so soon.
It would be wonderful if we could sail away, the two of us.
The two of us...
That reminds me. Wait here. I need another picture.
Another one?
Yes, I need another one.
To send to a girl?
No.
Really?
I said no, didn't I?
Do you take passport pictures?
There. Isn't that pretty?
Maybe, but he looks unhappy.
It would be sad to lose him.
I'm used to him now, and to you.
You're a funny girl.
Looking at you or listening to you... makes me want to cry.
That shooting is getting on my nerves.
Hungry?
I don't want a thing. I feel good.
You feel good with me?
You have no idea how good I feel with you.
I can breathe.
This must be what happiness feels like.
If I heard you say that to anyone else, I'd say it was silly.
But when you say it to me, it's strange but I like it.
You've got pretty eyes.
Kiss me.
Kiss me again.
I'll get the tickets.
There's a queue.
A queue?
What do you take me for?
Excuse me. We're with some ladies.
Six.
You've got a nerve!
Hands off!
We rule the roost here.
Don't make me laugh or my eye-liner will run.
I hate people like that.
People like what?
Shut up!
Find yourself another one.
Watch out for draughts.
My hat!
What's wrong, Lucien? Are you sick?
Watch the dog.
I warned you.
Come on, Nelly.
I'll kill him!
Zabel too. I'll shoot them both.
You do understand?
Of course I understand.
Life can be such a bitch.
It was deadly at Zabel's, stifling.
I'd have gone anywhere.
At the Petit Tabarin everyone danced and laughed.
Maurice was gentle with me and he said that he loved me.
I said I loved him too.
But it wasn't true.
No one really danced or laughed.
No one was in love. It was all make-believe.
Don't cry.
When you call me Nelly like that, it's as if I were still a little girl.
You haven't grown up all that much.
I have. I've grown up too fast and seen too much.
I'm damaged.
Damaged?
Don't be silly.
You're the sweetest girl I've ever met.
A pretty young girl who loves life is like a man making a bid for freedom.
The world is against them.
They get hunted down.
Living is hard.
Yes.
We're all alone.
At times we meet people we barely know and may never see again.
And they help us.
We don't know why.
It's strange.
People love one another.
No, they don't.
They don't have time for that.
I love you, Jean.
You talk like a child.
I really do love you. Don't leave me.
What will I do without you?
I'm not going back to Zabel's.
I can't live in constant fear.
Will you stay a few more days?
Who said I was leaving?
Seeing you in civvies, I suddenly thought...
What difference does it make?
Maybe you'll take me with you?
Take you with me?
Don't you like me?
Keep me with you.
You're beautiful.
Remember?
What?
Last night you woke me and spoke very softly.
You said you loved me.
I said that?
You must have been dreaming.
Or you were.
Me?
Dreaming out loud.
I don't dream.
Everyone dreams.
What time is it?
I don't know.
Eleven?
The sunlight is lovely.
Why are you smiling?
I don't know.
I thought life was so sad and now...
I see that maybe I was wrong so I'm happy.
Really?
I have to tell you something.
It's not very nice.
What is it?
Breakfast.
Come in.
I brought the newspaper.
There's an amazing crime story.
The victim wasn't just anybody.
He's not very cheery.
How many sugars?
Two.
GRUESOME DISCOVERY
The mutilated body of a local man washed up on the quay
How dreadful!
What's wrong?
I was right to be afraid.
I knew it. I sensed something was going to happen.
How dreadful!
Well, well.
Don't cry.
I'm sure the scream I heard that night... It was him.
I knew I wasn't dreaming.
Don't cry, Nelly.
I didn't love him and he hurt me, but that's not a reason to kill him.
Why?
Do you know who did this?
I'm pretty sure I do.
Yes?
Sorry. I need the tray.
The hotel only has two.
We've got twelve rooms so it's not easy.
You weren't very hungry.
Can I take it?
Yes, and make it quick.
There's quite a crowd on the quay where they found him.
And there's more.
Apparently, they found a parcel of clothes belonging to a soldier.
They say he did it.
Maybe he did. Who knows?
No, it's not possible.
You can't get dragged into this.
This or something else.
I was about to say something when that idiot came in with the paper, but...
It's quite simple.
A ship is sailing for Venezuela at four and I plan to be on it.
You're leaving me.
You must think I'm a bastard.
Why?
Because I should have told you last night.
I saw how happy you were. You were laughing.
I wanted you so badly so I said nothing.
You were right not to.
But it wouldn't have changed anything.
Kiss me.
I can explain. It's not complicated.
I'm a wanted man.
I don't need to know.
You can trust me.
I'm not a bad man.
Of course you're not because I love you.
Anyway, what of it?
If you were bad, perhaps I'd love you just the same.
Were you sure you'd get away?
Everything was set. I thought my luck had changed.
They won't find me on the Louisiana.
My papers are in order.
Unless...
Unless what?
Unless your guardian Zabel...
He threatened me. He guessed everything.
If he talks, I'm done for.
He won't say anything.
Why?
I know what to say to shut him up.
Do you think I'm going to let you go back there?
I've got nothing to fear.
Anyway, what can you do?
Nothing.
You must go.
I've been happy with you.
If you're free, I'll still be happy, even if you are far away.
I'll never forget you, Nelly.
Really.
If I manage to get away, I'll send for you.
I'll come.
You're going, I'm going.
We were so happy together.
You have no idea how much I like you... how much I wanted you last night.
And now?
Now?
I want you like I did last night.
Morning, all.
Apparently, it was a soldier who did it.
How do you know?
That's what they're saying.
They!
Who's "they"?
Boss, I want a room.
At this time of day?
Now is as good a time as any. Besides, I'm sleepy.
I'll pay in advance.
It's too early. The rooms are all occupied.
I'll wait.
Want something?
I'm not thirsty, I'm sleepy.
Nelly, is that you?
Yes, it's me.
I'm glad you're back.
I've been so worried.
Have you seen the paper?
Yes.
Let that be a lesson to you. No more running away.
Don't worry. They won't bother you.
They don't know who killed poor Maurice.
Some say it was Lucien Lagardier.
Others say it was a soldier.
Maybe yours.
My poor child!
I don't want anyone bothering him.
We both know who did it. And I can prove it.
You have too much imagination.
You heard a scream and found a cufflink behind a crate and now you're imagining terrible things.
Be quiet. I'm telling you, I know.
I bet the police came here today. Did you mention Jean?
The police did come here today.
They were very polite.
But I did not mention Jean.
If they had searched for him, they would have found him with you.
I'm sure you spent the night with him.
In a hotel.
In a bed!
You can't scare me now, whatever happens.
I'll never be scared again!
I want you to let him leave.
How you've changed, Nelly!
Your eyes have never shone so brightly.
You've lost your baby face.
Is it because you love him?
So that's it.
Why do you all have to be in love?
Does anyone love me?
This is my home.
And my home is your home.
Thanks.
Looking at my watercolours?
The follies of my youth.
Don't judge them too harshly.
Give me your passport and I'll take care of everything.
Thanks. See you later.
You don't scare me any longer.
You horrify me!
Let me go. You disgust me!
Don't yell. No one can hear you.
I want you to listen.
I won't come near you.
I want you to know why I killed him.
I thought you liked his looks.
That's enough!
Maurice was a good-for-nothing.
I couldn't bear the idea of you and him...
That's enough!
I did it because I was jealous.
You've never experienced jealousy, you stupid child.
It's terrible to be in love, to love like Romeo when you resemble Bluebeard.
Be quiet!
I horrify you, do I?
At times I horrify myself.
But it doesn't stop me from living.
At times I'm even happy, when you're near me.
Leave me alone!
I like you even when you scream.
You're the only thing I love.
Everyone else can die.
Let go of her.
Let go of her, you bastard!
You won't get out of here alive.
Come on.
Watch out!
Do you think you can leave, just like that?
You must believe in miracles.
Or Santa Claus.
I'll kill you too!
You're the worst scum I've ever met!
I'll say she helped kill him.
You're disgusting!
You don't deserve to live.
You're rotten to the core. Rotten!
What a mess!
Come on. Let's go.
Why did you come back?
I was on board the ship and then I got off because...
I wanted to tell you I'd been happy in my life for once, thanks to you.
The ship hasn't sailed yet. You could still make it.
The ship?
Please, Jean, you must go.
Come on.
Kiss me.
Quickly.
There is no time to lose.
Quickly!
It's not possible.
You can't leave me alone. You can't die.
I love you so much.
What do we care if we were expelled? The war's gonna start, so we would've left anyhow.
War!
Isn't it exciting, Scarlett?
Those fool Yankees want a war.
We'll show them!
Fiddle-dee-dee.
War, war, war!
This war talk's spoiling all the fun at every party.
I get so bored I could scream.
Besides, there isn't going to be any war.
Not gonna be any war?
Of course there'll be a war.
If either of you boys says "war" once again.. ..I'll go in the house.
But, Scarlett!
Don't you want us to have a war?
Wait a minute, honey, please!
We're sorry.
Well.. But remember, I warned you.
I've got an idea! We'll talk about the Wilkes' barbecue at Twelve Oaks.
You're eating barbecue with us, aren't you?
I haven't thought about that yet. I'll think about that tomorrow.
We want all your waltzes. First Brent, then me, then Brent, and so on.
Promise?
Why, I'd just love to.
If only I didn't have every one of them taken already.
You can't do that to us!
We'll tell you a secret.
A secret?
Who by? You know Melanie Hamilton?
Ashley Wilkes' cousin? She's visiting..
That goody-goody!
Who wants to know about her?
Anyway, we heard.. They say..
Ashley Wilkes is gonna marry her. - Wilkeses always marry their cousins.
Do we get those waltzes?
Of course.
It can't be true! Ashley loves me!
Scarlett!
What's gotten into her?
Suppose we made her mad?
Where are you going without your shawl and the night air coming?
How come you didn't ask them gentlemen to supper?
You got no more manners than a field hand. After me and Miss Ellen done labored with you!
Come on in before you catch your death of dampness.
No!
I'm going to wait for Pa to come home.
Come on in here!
Come on!
Quitting time!
Who says it's quitting time?
I's the foreman. I say when it's quitting time at Tara. Quitting time!
Quitting time!
There's none in the county can touch you, and none in the state.
Pa!
How proud of yourself you are!
Well, Katie Scarlett O'Hara, so you've been spying on me. Like your sister, you'll tell your mother that I was jumping again.
You know I'm no tattletale like Suellen.
But after you broke your knee last year jumping that fence..
I'll not have me own daughter telling me what I shall jump and not jump.
It's my own neck, so it is.
All right, Pa, you jump what you please. - How are they at Twelve Oaks?
The Wilkeses?
In the stew you'd expect with a barbecue and talking nothing but war.
Bother the war! Was there anyone else there?
Their cousin Melanie and her brother, Charles.
Melanie Hamilton is a pale-faced, mealy-mouthed ninny!
Ashley Wilkes doesn't think so.
Ashley Wilkes couldn't like anyone like her.
What's your interest in Ashley and Miss Melanie?
Nothing. Let's go into the house.
Has he been trifling with you?
Has he asked you to marry him?
No. - Nor will he.
I had it in strict confidence from John Wilkes today.. ..Ashley's going to marry Melanie. It'll be announced tomorrow night at the ball.
I don't believe it!
Here! Where are you off to?
Scarlett!
What are you about?
Have you been running after a man who's not in love with you?
When you might have any other?
I haven't been running after him, it's just a surprise.
Now, don't be jerking your chin at me!
If Ashley wanted to marry you, I'd have misgivings.
I want my girl to be happy. You'd not be happy with him.
I would! I would!
What's the difference who you marry? So long as he's a Southerner.
And when I'm gone I'll leave Tara to you.
I don't want it. It doesn't mean anything..
Do you mean to tell me, Katie Scarlett O'Hara.. ..that land doesn't mean anything to you?
Land is the only thing in the world worth working for.. ..worth fighting for, worth dying for.
It's the only thing that lasts!
You talk like an Irishman.
It's proud I am that I'm Irish.
Don't you be forgetting.. ..that you're half Irish too.
To anyone with a drop of Irish blood in them.. ..the land they live on is like their mother.
But there now. You're just a child. It'll come to you, this love of the land.
There's no getting away from it if you're Irish.
Here she comes! Scarlett, Suellen, Carreen, your mama's home!
Acting like a wet nurse to them white-trash Slatterys.. ..instead of eating her supper.
Set up the fire!
Got no business wearing herself out..
Pork!
Take the lamp out on the porch. Wearing herself out.
Mr. Gerald, Miss Ellen's home! Waiting on them poor white trash.
Shut up, dog! Barking in the house!
Get up from there! Don't you hear Miss Ellen? Get out there and get her medicine chest!
We was worried about you, Miss Ellen.
It's all right, Pork.
Mrs. O'Hara, we finished plowing the creek bottom today. What do you want me to start on tomorrow?
Mr. Wilkerson, I've just come from Emmie Slattery's bedside.
Your child has been born.
My child, ma'am?
I'm sure I don't understand.
Has been born and mercifully has died. Good night, Mr. Wilkerson.
I fix your supper myself and you eats it.
Yes, after prayers, Mammy.
Mr. O'Hara, you must dismiss Jonas Wilkerson.
Dismiss him, Mrs. O'Hara?
He's the best overseer in the county.
He must go tomorrow morning, the first thing!
No. - Yes.
The Yankee Wilkerson and the white-trash Slattery girl?
We'll discuss it later, Mr. O'Hara.
Yes, Mrs. O'Hara.
Can't she wear my pink dress? I wanna wear Scarlett's green dress.
I don't like your tone, Suellen.
Your pink gown's lovely.
Can't I stay up for the ball?
You may wear my garnets.
Why can't I stay up for the ball tomorrow?
Scarlett. You look tired, my dear. I'm worried about you.
I'm all right, Mother.
Why can't I stay up for the ball?
I'm 13 now.
You may go to the barbecue.
I didn't want your tacky dress anyhow!
Hush up!
Prayers, girls.
..and to all the saints, that I have sinned in thought, word and deed..
..through my fault, through my fault, through my most grievous fault.
Therefore, I beseech thee, blessed Mary, ever virgin.. ..blessed Michael the Archangel.. ..blessed John the Baptist..
..the Holy Apostles, Peter and Paul, and all the saints.. ..pray to the Lord..
Ashley doesn't know I love him.
I'll tell him that I love him.. ..and then he can't marry.
Hear thee Almighty, most merciful Lord.. ..grant us pardon, absolution and remission of our sins. Amen.
Just hold on and suck in!
Mammy, here's Miss Scarlett's vittles.
Take it back to the kitchen. I won't eat a bite.
Yes'm, you is! You's gonna eat every mouthful.
No, I'm not!
Put on the dress. We're late already.
What my lamb gonna wear?
That.
No, you ain't! You can't show your bosom before 3:00!
I'm gonna speak to your ma!
If you say one word to mother, I won't eat a bite.
Well..
Keep your shawl on.
I ain't aiming for you to get freckled.. ..after the buttermilk I done put on you, bleaching them freckles.
Now, Miss Scarlett. You come on and be good and eat just a little, honey.
No! I'm going to have a good time today and eat at the barbecue.
If you don't care what folks says, I does!
You can always tell a lady by how she eats in front of folks like a bird.
I ain't aiming for you to go to John Wilkes' and gobble like a hog!
Fiddle-dee-dee!
Ashley told me he likes girls with a healthy appetite.
What gentlemens says and thinks is different things.
And I ain't noticed Mr. Ashley asking for to marry you.
Now don't eat too fast. Ain't no need a having it come right back up again.
Why is it a girl has to be so silly to catch a husband?
Scarlett O'Hara!
If you're not down here by the time I count 10..
..we'll go without you! - I'm coming, Pa!
One, two, three, four, five..
Oh, dear! My stays are so tight, I'll never get through the day without belching!
Well, John Wilkes. - It's a grand day for the barbecue.
So it seems, Gerald. Why isn't Mrs. O'Hara with you?
She's settling accounts with the overseer, but she'll be along tonight.
Welcome to Twelve Oaks, Mr. O'Hara.
Thank you kindly, India. Your daughter's getting prettier every day, John.
Here are the O'Hara girls. We must greet them.
I can't stand Scarlett. She throws herself at Ashley.
That's your brother's business. You must remember your duties as hostess.
Good morning, girls.
Good morning, Scarlett.
India Wilkes, what a lovely dress!
I just can't take my eyes off it.
Good morning, Miss Scarlett.
You look mighty fine this morning, Miss Scarlett.
It's a pleasure to see you, Miss Scarlett.
Ashley!
Scarlett, my dear!
I've been looking for you everywhere.
I've got something I must tell you. Can't we go someplace quiet?
Yes, I'd like to, but I have something to tell you too.
Something I hope you'll be glad to hear. Come say hello to my cousin Melanie first.
Oh, do we have to?
She's been looking forward to seeing you again.
Melanie!
Here's Scarlett.
Scarlett!
I'm so glad to see you again.
Melanie, what a surprise to run into you here. I hope you'll stay with us a few days.
I hope I shall stay long enough for us to become real friends.
I do want us to be.
We'll keep her here, won't we?
We'll make the biggest fuss over her!
If anybody can give a girl a good time, it's Ashley.
Our good times must seem silly to you. You're so serious.
Oh, Scarlett, you have so much life. I've always admired you. I wish I could be more like you.
You mustn't flatter me and say things you don't mean.
Nobody could accuse Melanie of being insincere. Could they, my dear?
She's not like you, is she, Ashley? He never means a word he says to any girl.
Why, Charles Hamilton, you handsome old thing, you!
But, Miss O'Hara, I..
Was it kind to bring your good-looking brother here to break my poor heart?
Now that Charles is your beau, she's after him like a hornet.
Charles, I want to eat barbecue with you. Don't go philandering with any other girl, because I'm mighty jealous.
I won't, Miss O'Hara. I couldn't!
I do declare, Frank Kennedy!
You look dashing with those new whiskers.
Thank you, thank you, Miss Scarlett.
Charles and Wade asked me to eat with them, but I told them I promised you.
You needn't be so amused. She's after your beau now.
That's mighty flattering of you, Miss Scarlett.
I'll see what I can do.
Why's your sister mad? You sparking her beau?
As if I couldn't do better than that old maid in britches.
Brent and Stuart, you handsome old things!
I didn't mean it. I'm mad at you!
What have we done?
You haven't been near me all day!
I wore this old dress for you.
I was counting on eating with you.
You are, Scarlett.
Of course you are, honey.
I never can make up my mind which of you is the handsomest.
I was awake all last night trying to figure it out.
Oh, shucks!
Cathleen, who's that?
Who?
That man looking at us and smiling. The nasty dark one.
Don't you know?
That's Rhett Butler. He's from Charleston. He has a most terrible reputation.
He looks as if he knows what I look like without my shimmy.
My dear, he isn't received.
He spends his time up North because his folks won't speak to him.
He was expelled from West Point, he's so fast. And there's that business about the girl he wouldn't marry.
Tell, tell!
He took her out buggy-riding in the late afternoon without a chaperon..
..and then he refused to marry her!
No, but she was ruined just the same.
Ashley..
Happy?
So happy.
You seem to belong here..
..as if it had all been imagined for you.
I like to feel that I belong to the things you love.
You love Twelve Oaks as I do.
Yes, Ashley. I love it as more than a house.
It's a whole world that wants only to be graceful and beautiful.
It's so unaware that it may not last forever.
You're afraid of what may happen if the war comes?
But we don't have to be afraid for us. No war can come into our world, Ashley.
Whatever comes, I'll love you.. ..just as I do now, until I die.
Isn't this better than a table?
A girl hasn't got but two sides to her at a table.
I'll get her dessert.
She said me!
Allow me, Miss O'Hara?
I think..
Hmm..
I think Charles Hamilton may get it.
Thank you, Miss O'Hara. Thank you!
Go get it, boy! Isn't he the luckiest..
Miss O'Hara.. ..I love you.
I don't guess I'm as hungry as I thought.
Why do I have to take a nap? I'm not tired.
Well-brought-up ladies takes naps at parties.
It's time you behave and act like you was Miss Ellen's daughter.
When we were in Saratoga, I didn't see Yankee girls taking naps.
And you won't see no Yankee girls at the ball, neither.
How was Ashley today? He didn't pay much attention to you.
You mind your own business!
You'll be lucky you don't lose whisker-face Kennedy.
You're sweet on Ashley, and his engagement's being announced tonight.
That's as much as you know.
You ought to behave yourself!
Acting like poor white-trash children! If you's old enough for parties, you should act like ladies!
Who cares?
We've borne enough insults from the Yankees.
We'll keep our slaves with or without their approval.
'Twas the sovereign right of Georgia to secede from the Union.
The South must assert herself by force of arms.
After we've fired on the Yankee rascals at Fort Sumter, we've got to fight. - There's no other way.
That's right!
Let the Yankees ask for peace.
The situation's very simple. The Yankees can't fight and we can.
There won't be a battle. They'll turn and run.
One of us can lick 20 Yanks.
We'll beat them in one battle. Gentlemen can always fight better than rabble.
Gentlemen always fight better.
What does the captain of our Troop say?
Well, gentlemen, if Georgia fights, I go with her.
I hope the Yankees let us leave the Union in peace.
Ashley, they've insulted us!
You can't mean you don't want war?
Most of the miseries of the world were caused by wars.
And when the wars were over, no one ever knew what they were about.
Now, gentlemen. Mr. Butler's been up North, I hear.
Don't you agree with us?
I think it's hard winning a war with words.
What do you mean, sir?
There's not a cannon factory in the whole South.
What difference does that make to a gentleman?
It'll make a great difference to a great many gentlemen, sir.
Are you hinting that the Yankees can lick us?
No, I'm not hinting. I'm saying plainly, the Yankees are better equipped than we.
They've got factories, shipyards, coal mines.. ..and a fleet to bottle up our harbors and starve us.
All we've got is cotton and slaves, and arrogance.
I refuse to listen to any renegade talk!
I'm sorry if the truth offends you.
Apologies aren't enough, sir.
I hear you were turned out of West Point, Mr. Rhett Butler.
And you aren't received in any family in Charleston.
Not even your own!
I apologize again for all my shortcomings.
Perhaps you won't mind if I look over your place?
I seem to be spoiling everybody's brandy and cigars.. ..and dreams of victory.
That's what you can expect from somebody like Rhett Butler.
You did everything but call him out.
He refused to fight.
Not quite there, Charles. - He refused to take advantage of you.
Take advantage of me?
He's one of the best shots in the country, as he's proved many times.
He's got steadier hands than yours.
Well, I'll show him! Please.
Don't go tweaking his nose anymore.
You may be needed for more important fighting.
If you'll excuse me, Mr. Butler's our guest. I think I'll just show him around.
Ashley!
Ashley..
Scarlett.
Who are you hiding from in here?
What are you up to?
Why aren't you upstairs, resting with the other girls?
What is this, Scarlett, a secret?
Oh, Ashley..
Ashley!
I love you.
Scarlett!
I love you, I do!
Isn't it enough that you gathered every other man's heart today?
You've always had mine. You cut your teeth on it.
Don't tease me now.
Have I your heart, my darling?
I love you, I love you!
You mustn't say such things. You'll hate me for hearing them.
I could never hate you, and I know you must care about me.
You do care, don't you?
Yes, I care.
Can't we go away and forget we ever said these things?
But how can we do that?
Don't you..? Don't you want to marry me?
I'm going to marry Melanie.
But you can't! Not if you care for me!
Oh, my dear, why must you make me say things that will hurt you?
How can I make you understand?
You're so young, you don't know what marriage means.
I know I love you, and I want to be your wife.
You don't love Melanie.
She's like me, Scarlett. She's my blood and we understand each other.
But you love me!
How could I help loving you?
You have all the passion for life that I lack.
That kind of love isn't enough for two people as different as we are.
Why not say it, you coward? You're afraid to marry me.
You'd marry that fool who can only say.. .."yes," "no" and raise a passel of mealy-mouthed brats!
You mustn't say that!
Who are you to tell me I mustn't?
You led me on! - You made me believe you'd marry me.
Scarlett, be fair! - I never at any time..
You did!
It's true, you did! I'll hate you till I die!
I can't think of anything bad enough to call you!
Has the war started?
Sir, you should have made your presence known.
In the middle of that beautiful love scene?
That wouldn't have been tactful, would it?
But don't worry. Your secret is safe with me.
Sir, you are no gentleman.
And you, miss, are no lady.
I don't hold that against you. Ladies never held any charm for me.
First you take advantage of me, then you insult me!
I meant it as a compliment.
I hope to see more of you, when you're free of the spell of Mr. Wilkes.
He doesn't strike me as good enough for a girl of your.. What was it? Your "passion for living."
How dare you! You aren't fit to wipe his boots!
And you were going to hate him for the rest of your life.
She certainly made a fool of herself running after all the men.
That's not fair, India. She's so attractive, men naturally flock to her.
Melanie, you're just too good to be true.
Didn't you see her going after Charles?
And she knows Charles belongs to me.
You're wrong, India.
Scarlett's just high-spirited and vivacious.
Men flirt with girls like that, but they don't marry them.
I think you're being very mean to her.
Miss O'Hara!
Miss O'Hara!
Mr. Lincoln's called volunteers to fight against us!
Don't you men think about anything important?
But it's war! Everybody's going off to enlist. I'm going too!
Everybody?
Miss O'Hara, will you be sorry?
I'll cry into my pillow every night.
Miss O'Hara, I told you I loved you.
You're the most beautiful girl in the world, and the sweetest, the dearest.
I couldn't hope that you could love me.
I'm so clumsy and stupid and not nearly good enough for you.
But if you could think of marrying me, I'd do anything in the world for you. Just anything, I promise.
What did you say?
Miss O'Hara, I said, "Would you marry me?"
Yes, Mr. Hamilton, I will.
You will?
You'll marry me? You'll wait for me?
I don't think I'd want to wait.
You'll marry me before I go?
Oh, Miss O'Hara! Scarlett.
When may I speak to your father?
The sooner the better.
I'll go now, I can't wait. Will you excuse me, dear?
Dear!
Mr. O'Hara! Mr. O'Hara!
It'll be a week before they call me.
A week till they take you away from me!
Oh, Ashley.
I thought of you at our wedding yesterday.. ..and I hoped yours would be as beautiful.
And it was!
Was it?
Now we're really and truly sisters.
Charles!
Melanie.
Don't cry, darling.
The war will be over in a few weeks, and I'll be coming back to you.
Miss Scarlett!
I don't care! I'm too young to be a widow.
Miss Scarlett!
Why, I'd just go around scaring people in that thing.
You shouldn't be around people. You's in mourning!
For what?
I don't feel anything.
Why should I have to pretend and pretend?
What is it?
Oh, poor baby! What is it?
My life is over! - Nothing will ever happen to me anymore!
Darling..
Oh, Mother, I know you think I'm horrible. But I just can't bear going around in black.
It's bad enough not being able to go to parties. But looking this way too?
I don't think you're at all horrible.
It's only natural you want to look young and be young when you are young.
Oh, baby! How would you like to visit somewhere? Savannah, perhaps?
What would I do in Savannah?
Well, Atlanta then. There's lots going on there.
And you can stay with Melanie and her Aunt Pittypat.
Melanie?
Yes. Yes, I could, couldn't I?
Oh, Mother, you're sweeter than anybody in the world!
You'd like it, really?
All right, then. Now stop your crying and smile.
You can take Prissy with you.
Start packing Miss Scarlett's things, Mammy.
I'll go write the necessary letters.
Atlanta!
Savannah would be better for you. You'll get in trouble in Atlanta.
What are you talking about?
You know what I's talking about. I'm talking about Mr. Ashley Wilkes.
He'll come to Atlanta for his leave and you waiting for him just like a spider!
He belongs to Miss Melanie..
Go pack my things like Mother said!
They're all whispering, and I know it's about her!
What's it matter, Pittypat?
Scarlett's living under my roof, so they think I'm responsible for her.
And for a widow to appear in public at a social gathering..
..every time I think of it, I feel faint.
You know Scarlett came here only to help raise money for the Cause.
It was splendid of her to make the sacrifice.
Anyone hearing you talk would think she came to dance instead of sell things.
Ladies and gentlemen, I have important news! Glorious news!
Another triumph for our magnificent men in arms!
General Lee has completely whipped the enemy.. ..and swept the Yankee army northward from Virginia!
And now, a happy surprise for all of us.
We have with us tonight, that most daring of all blockade runners.. ..whose fleet schooners, slipping past the Yankee guns..
..have brought us here the very woolens and laces we wear tonight. I refer, ladies and gentlemen, to that will-o'-the-wisp of the bounding main.
None other than our friend from Charleston.. ..Captain Rhett Butler!
Permit me.
Captain Butler, such a pleasure to see you again. I met you last at my husband's home.
That's kind of you to remember, Mrs. Wilkes.
Did you meet Captain Butler at Twelve Oaks, Scarlett?
Yes, I.. I think so.
Only for a moment. It was in the library. You had broken something.
Yes, Captain Butler, I remember you.
Ladies, the Confederacy asks for your jewelry on behalf of our noble Cause.
We aren't wearing any. We're in mourning.
Wait.
On behalf of Mrs. Wilkes and Mrs. Hamilton.
Thank you, Captain Butler.
Just a moment, please.
But it's your wedding ring, ma'am.
It may help my husband more off my finger.
That was a very beautiful thing to do.
Here. You can have mine too. For the Cause.
And you, Mrs. Hamilton. I know just how much that means to you.
Melanie?
Dr. Meade?
I need your approval.. ..for something we want to do that's rather shocking.
Will you excuse us?
I'll say one thing. The war makes the most peculiar widows.
I wish you'd go away! If you had any raising, you'd know I'd never want to see you again!
Now, why be silly? You've no reason for hating me.
I'll carry your guilty secret to my grave.
I'd be very unpatriotic to hate a great hero of the war.
I declare, I was surprised you turned out to be a noble character.
I can't bear to take advantage of your little-girl ideas. I'm neither noble nor heroic.
But you are a blockade runner?
For profit, and profit only.
You don't believe in the Cause?
Rhett Butler is the only cause I know. The rest doesn't mean much to me.
And now, ladies and gentlemen.. ..I have a startling surprise for the benefit of the hospital.
Gentlemen, if you wish to lead the reel with the lady of your choice.. ..you must bid for her!
Caroline Meade, how can you let your husband conduct this slave auction!
Darlene Merriwether, how dare you criticize me!
Melanie told the doctor that if it's for the Cause, it's quite all right.
She did?
Oh, dear! Oh, dear!
Where are my smelling salts?
I think I shall faint.
Don't you dare faint, Pittypat! If Melanie says it's all right, it is all right.
Come, gentlemen, do I hear your bids? Make your offers!
Don't be bashful, gentlemen!
Twenty dollars!
Twenty dollars for Miss Maybelle Merriwether!
Twenty-five dollars for Miss Fanny Elsing!
Only $25 to give your..
One hundred and fifty dollars in gold.
For what lady, sir?
For Mrs. Charles Hamilton.
For whom, sir?
Mrs. Charles Hamilton.
Mrs. Hamilton is in mourning. But I'm sure any of our Atlanta belles would be proud to..
Dr. Meade, I said Mrs. Charles Hamilton.
She will not consider it, sir.
Oh, yes, I will!
Choose your partners for the Virginia reel!
We've shocked the Confederacy.
It's like blockade running, isn't it?
It's worse. I expect a very fancy profit out of it.
I don't care what you expect. I'm gonna dance and dance!
Tonight I wouldn't mind dancing with Abe Lincoln himself!
Another dance and my reputation will be lost forever.
With enough courage you can do without a reputation.
Oh, you do talk scandalous!
You do waltz divinely, Captain Butler.
Don't start flirting with me. I'm not one of your plantation beaus.
I want more than flirting from you.
What do you want?
I'll tell you, Scarlett O'Hara, if you'll take that Southern belle simper off your face.
Someday I want you to say to me the words I heard you say to Ashley Wilkes.
I love you."
That's something you'll never hear from me as long as you live.
How sweet.
How kind. He is a thoughtful gentleman.
Why doesn't he say something about my sacrifice?
Oh, the darling thing! Oh, Rhett, it's lovely, lovely!
You didn't really bring it all the way from Paris just for me.
Yes, I thought it was about time I got you out of that fake mourning.
Next trip I'll bring you some green silk for a frock to match it.
Oh, Rhett.
It's my duty to our.. ..brave boys at the front to keep our girls at home looking pretty.
It's so long since I had anything new!
How do I look?
Awful! Just awful! Why?
What's the matter?
This war's stopped being a joke when a girl doesn't know the latest fashion.
Oh, Rhett! Let me do it.
But, Rhett, I don't know how I'd dare wear it!
You will, though.
And another thing, those pantalets! I don't know a woman in Paris who wears pantalets anymore.
What do they..?
You shouldn't talk about such things.
You don't mind my knowing about them, just my talking about them.
I can't go on accepting these gifts, though you're awfully kind.
I'm not kind. I'm tempting you.
I never give without expecting something in return. I always get paid.
I won't marry you to pay for the bonnet.
Don't flatter yourself.
I'm not a marrying man.
Well, I won't kiss you for it either.
Open your eyes and look at me.
No, I don't think I will kiss you.
Although you need kissing, badly. That's what's wrong with you.
You should be kissed, and often. And by someone who knows how.
And I suppose you think you're the proper person!
I might be, if the right moment ever came.
You're a conceited, black-hearted varmint! I don't know why I let you come and see me.
I'll tell you why, Scarlett.
I'm the only man over 16 and under 60 who's around to show you a good time.
But cheer up. The war can't last much longer.
Really, Rhett?
Why?
There's a battle going on now that ought to fix things..
..one way or the other. - Oh, Rhett. Is Ashley in it?
So you haven't gotten the wooden-headed Mr. Wilkes out of your mind. - Yes, I suppose he's in it.
But tell me, where is it?
Some little town in Pennsylvania called Gettysburg.
Casualty lists! Casualty lists!
Here you is. They was fighting for them so, it got tore in half.
Scarlett, you look. The W's at the end.
Wellman, Wendel, White, Whitman, Wilkens, Williams, Woolsey, Wortman..
Scarlett, you've passed him!
He isn't there! He isn't there!
Ashley's safe, he isn't listed!
Oh, he's safe. He's safe!
Scarlett, you're so sweet to worry about Ashley like this for me.
I must go to her.
Don't, my dear. Not here.
Let's go home.
Dr. Meade, not..?
Yes, our boy Darcy.
I was making these mittens for him. He won't need them now.
Well, I'm gonna enlist. I'll show them! I'll kill those Yankees!
You hush your mouth. You think it'll help your mother to have you shot too? It's silly!
It's a black day, Scarlett. Haven't had bad news, have you?
Ashley's safe.
I'm glad, for Mrs. Wilkes' sake.
There are so many others.
Any of your friends?
About every family in the county. - The Tarleton boys, both of them.
Yes. Look at them. All these poor tragic people.
The South's sinking to its knees. It'll never rise again.
The Cause. The cause of living in the past is dying right in front of us.
I never heard you talk like that.
I'm angry. Waste always makes me angry and that's what this is, sheer waste!
But don't you be downcast. Ashley's still alive to come home to the women who love him.
Both of them.
You're here!
Oh, you're here! You're really here at last!
Oh, my dear, I've waited so long!
Melanie, my dear, my darling wife!
But we're forgetting Scarlett.
Scarlett, dear.
Why, is this any way to greet a returning warrior?
Ashley, I.. I..
Merry Christmas, Ashley.
Come on, old gentleman, come on.
We's ate all your wives. We's ate all your little chicks. You got nobody to worry your head about leaving.
Come on. Now you just stand still so you.. ..can be Christmas for the white folks.
Now, hold on! Hold on!
Don't go getting so uppity. Even if you is the last chicken in Atlanta.
Let's not talk about the war.
Let's talk Twelve Oaks and Tara and times before there was a war.
Could we have the wine?
Why did you say there wasn't enough?
There's plenty.
It's the very last of my father's fine Madeira. He got it from his uncle Admiral Will Hamilton of Savannah..
..who married his cousin Jessica Carroll of Carrolton..
..who was his second cousin and akin to the Wilkeses too.
I saved it to wish Ashley a merry Christmas.
But you mustn't drink it all at once, because it is the last.
I meant it, my dear. It was a lovely Christmas gift. Only generals have tunics like this.
I'm so happy you like it.
Where did you get the cloth?
It was sent by a Charleston lady.
I nursed her son while he was in the hospital before he died and..
You will take good care of it, won't you? You won't let it get torn. Promise me.
You mustn't worry. I'll bring it back to you without any holes in it.
Good night, my dear.
Good night, Scarlett, darling.
Uncle Peter, is it time for Mr. Ashley to leave?
Pretty quick now, Miss Scarlett.
Melanie isn't going to the depot? She hasn't changed her mind?
No, ma'am, she's laying down. She's so upset, Mr. Wilkes told her she can't even come downstairs.
Ashley..
Ashley, let me go to the depot with you.
Scarlett, I'd rather remember you as you are now. Not shivering at the depot.
All right. Ashley, I've got a present for you too!
Why, Scarlett, it's beautiful!
Tie it on me, my dear.
While Melly was making a new tunic, I made this to go with it.
You made it yourself?
Well, then I shall value it all the more.
You know there's nothing I wouldn't do for you.
There's something you can do for me.
What is it?
Will you look after Melanie for me?
She's so frail and gentle, and she loves you so much.
If I were killed..
You mustn't say that! It's bad luck. Say a prayer, quickly.
You say one for me.
We shall need all our prayers. Now the end is coming.
The end?
The end of the war..
..and the end of our world, Scarlett.
But you don't think the Yankees are beating us?
Oh, Scarlett, my men are barefooted now! And the snow in Virginia's deep.
When I see them, and I see the Yankees coming and coming.. ..always more and more!
When the end does come, I shall be far away.
It'll be a comfort to me to know that she has you. You will promise, won't you?
Yes.
Is that all, Ashley?
All except.. goodbye.
Oh, Ashley, I can't let you go!
You must be brave.
You must! - No, no! How else can I bear going?
Oh, Scarlett! You're so fine and strong and beautiful.
Not just your sweet face, my dear..
Ashley, kiss me. Kiss me goodbye.
Ashley.
No, Scarlett.
No! - Oh, Ashley, I love you. I've always loved you.
I only married Charles just to hurt you.
Ashley, tell me you love me. I'll live on it the rest of my life!
Goodbye.
When the war's over, Ashley.
When the war's over.
And there's a place back home..
..where a wild plum tree comes to flower in the springtime..
..down by the creek, you know.
Yes, I know, I know.
When we were little, my brother Jeff and I used to..
I told you about my brother Jeff, didn't I, ma'am?
I know I did. He.. We don't know where Jeff is now, ma'am.
Since Bull Run, we haven't heard anything and..
Please, we must have your temperature now. Just take this in your mouth and not talk anymore. Not just now.
Melanie, I'm so tired. I've got to go home. Aren't you tired, Melanie?
No, I'm not tired, Scarlett.
This might be Ashley.. ..and only strangers here to comfort him.
No, I'm not tired, Scarlett.
They could all be.. ..Ashley.
I've been waiting one solid hour to speak to you, Mrs. Wilkes.
Go on, you trash.
Don't you be pestering these ladies.
Don't talk to her.
It's all right. Who are you?
My name's Belle Watling. But that don't matter. You think I got no business here.
Tell me what you want to see me about.
First time I come here, I says, "Belle, you're a nurse." They didn't want my kind of nursing.
They was more than likely right.
Then I tried giving them money. My money wasn't good enough either! The old peahens!
I know a gentleman who says you're a human being. If you are, which they ain't, you'll take my money for the hospital.
What are you doing here?
Haven't you been told twice already?
This time I'm conversing with Mrs. Wilkes! You might as well take my money.
It's good money, even if it is mine.
I'm sure you're very generous.
I'm a Confederate, like everybody else.
Of course you are!
Some folks here wouldn't feel that way.
But maybe they ain't as good Christians as you.
Look, Mrs. Meade, it's a great deal of money.
Ten, 20, 30, 50!
And it's not our paper money, it's gold!
Let me see that handkerchief.
R.B.!
And she's driving away in Rhett Butler's carriage!
Oh, if I just wasn't a lady, what wouldn't I tell that varmint!
The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want."
He maketh me to lie down in green pastures."
He restoreth my soul." "He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for His name's sake."
Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death.." ".. I will fear no evil, for Thou art with me."
Thy rod and Thy staff, they comfort me."
Yankees! Oh, Dr. Meade, they're getting closer.
They'll never get into Atlanta. Never get through old Peg Leg Hood.
Give me something for the pain!
Give me something for the pain!
Sorry, son, we haven't got anything to give you.
These animals is driving me crazy!
What luck!
You got my jack.
Give me an ace and I'll start another war.
And I'll bid the moon.
..that I never see you and my Pa again.
This leg's got to come off.
No, don't! Leave me alone!
I'm sorry, soldier.
We're all out of chloroform.
We'll operate without it.
No, no, you won't! You can't do it. I won't let you do it!
Tell Dr. Wilson to take this leg off. It's gangrene.
No! Oh!
I haven't seen my family in three days. I'm going home for half an hour.
Orderly, give me a lift!
Nurse, you can free this bed.
Miss Scarlett!
Why, Frank Kennedy.
Miss Suellen. Is she well?
When did they bring you in?
Are you bad hurt?
Suellen. Is she..?
She's all right.
Dr. Wilson needs you in the operating room. He's gonna take off that leg.
I'll be back.
No! You leave me alone!
Don't!
I can't stand it! No, don't!
Don't cut!
Don't! Don't!
Please!
Where's the nurse?
Dr. Wilson's waiting.
Let him wait! I'm going home! I've done enough!
I don't want any more men dying and screaming.
Big Sam!
Big Sam! Big Sam!
Almighty Moses! It's Miss Scarlett!
Big Sam!
Big Sam. Sam, Elijah, Prophet, Apostle. I'm so glad to see you.
Tell me about Tara, about my mother. She didn't write me.
She gone got sick. - Sick?
Just a little bit sick, that's all.
Your pa went wild when they wouldn't let him fight.
He had fits when they took us to dig the ditch for the soldiers.
Your ma said the Confederacy needs it. We's digging for the South.
Was there a doctor?
We've got to march.
Don't worry, we'll stop them Yankees.
Goodbye, Big Sam. Goodbye, boys. If you get sick or hurt, let me know.
Goodbye, Miss Scarlett. Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Scarlett! Scarlett!
Whoa. Climb into this buggy. This is no day for walking.
Oh, Rhett. Drive me to Aunt Pitty's, please.
Panic's a pretty sight, isn't it?
Just another of Sherman's calling cards. He'll pay us a visit soon.
I gotta get out of here before the Yankees come!
Leave your work at the hospital?
Or have you had enough of death and lice and men chopped up?
I suppose you weren't meant for sick men.
Don't talk like that. I'm so scared! I wish I could get out of here.
Let's get out together.
No use letting the South come down around your ears.
There are too many nice places to go and visit.
Mexico, London, Paris..
With you?
Yes, ma'am. With a man who understands and admires you for what you are.
I figure we belong together, being the same sort.
I've been waiting for you to grow up and get Ashley out of your heart.
Well, I hear Mrs. Wilkes is going to have a baby in another month or so.
It'll be hard loving a man with a wife and baby clinging to him.
Well, here we are.
Are you going with me or are you getting out?
I hate and despise you, Rhett Butler. I'll hate and despise you till I die!
Oh, no, you won't, Scarlett.
Miss Scarlett! Miss Scarlett!
Folks is all going to Macon, and folks is running away!
I can't bear those cannonballs right in my ears!
I faint every time I hear one.
Uncle Peter, look out for that trunk.
You aren't leaving?
I may be a coward.. ..but oh, dear!
Yankees in Georgia!
How did they ever get in?
I'm going too. Prissy, go pack my things.
Wait, I won't be a minute.
Do you really think you ought to?
Scarlett!
What is this?
You ain't planning on running away?
Don't try to stop me. I'm never going back to that hospital.
I've had enough of smelling death, of rot and death.
I'm going home! I want my mother. My mother needs me.
Listen to me! You must stay here.
Without a chaperon?
It simply isn't..
Good heavens, this is war, not a garden party!
Melanie needs you. - Oh, bother Melanie!
She's ill already.
She shouldn't even be having a baby.
Can't we take her along?
Want her to be jounced over rough roads and have the baby ahead of time?
It isn't my baby.
You take care of her! We haven't enough doctors to look after a sick woman.
You've got to stay.
What for?
I don't know anything about babies being born.
I knows! I knows! I knows how to do it.
I's done it lots and lots. Let me, doctor. Let me.
Good. I'll rely on you to help us.
Ashley's fighting in the field. Fighting for the Cause. He may never come back.
Scarlett, we owe him a well-born child.
If you're coming, Scarlett, hurry!
I promised Ashley something..
Then you'll stay?
Good. Go along, Miss Pittypat. Scarlett's staying.
Go on, Uncle Peter. I don't know what to do.
It's like the end of the world! Uncle Peter, my smelling salt!
Melanie, Melanie! It's all your fault!
I hate you! I hate you! And I hate your baby!
If only I hadn't promised Ashley. If only I hadn't promised him!
Stop! Stop! Stop!
Are the Yankees coming?
The army's pulling out.
Pulling out and leaving us to the Yankees?
Not leaving, evacuating.
Before Sherman cuts the McDonough road.
It can't be true!
What'll I do?
Better refugee south, right quick.
Prissy! Prissy! Go pack my things and Melanie's too.
The Yankees are coming!
Scarlett!
Scarlett!
Melly, we're going to..
Melly..
I'm sorry to be such a bother, Scarlett.
It began at daybreak.
But the Yankees are coming.
Poor Scarlett. You'd be at Tara now with your mother, wouldn't you? If it weren't for me.
Oh, Scarlett, darling. You've been so good to me. No sister could have been sweeter.
I've been lying here thinking.. ..if I should die.. ..will you take my baby?
Fiddle-dee-dee, Melly. Aren't things bad enough without you talking about dying?
I'll send for Dr. Meade.
Not yet, Scarlett. I couldn't let Dr. Meade sit here for hours.. ..while all those poor, wounded boys..
Prissy!
Prissy, Prissy! Come here, quick!
Go get Dr. Meade. Run!
The baby.
Don't stand there like a scared goat.
Hurry, hurry! I'll sell you south, I will. I swear I will!
Where's that Prissy?
This room's like an oven already and it isn't noon yet.
Don't worry, Melly.
Mother says it always seems like the doctor will never come.
If I don't take a strap to that Prissy!
Oh, Melly.. Know what I heard about Maybelle Merriwether? You remember that funny-looking beau of hers?
The one with the uniform like ladies' red flannels?
You don't have to keep on talking for my sake. I know how worried you are.
Oh, Melly.. I'll just go and fetch you some cooler water.
You're slow as molasses in January. Where's Dr. Meade?
I never seen him, Miss Scarlett.
What?
He ain't at the hospital. A man told me that the doctor's down at the car shed.. ..with the wounded soldiers..
Well, why didn't you go after him?
Miss Scarlett, I's scared to go down there at the car shed.
There's folks dying down there. And I's scared of dead folks!
Go sit by Miss Melly.
And don't you be upsetting her or I'll whip the hide off you.
Have you seen..?
Move aside, lady, please.
Dr. Meade?
Dr. Meade. Dr. Meade, at last!
Thank heaven you're here. I need every pair of hands.
Now, come, child, wake up. We got work to do.
But Melly's having her baby. You've got to come with me!
Are you crazy?
I can't leave these men for a baby.
They're dying! Hundreds! Get a woman to help.
But there isn't anybody. Dr. Meade, she might die. Die?
Look at them, bleeding to death in front of my eyes!
No chloroform. No bandages. Nothing!
Run along and don't bother me.
Don't worry, child. There's nothing to bringing a baby.
Bring the stretchers in here.
Dr. Meade?
Yeah, I'm coming.
Is the doctor come?
No, he can't come.
Oh, Miss Scarlett, Miss Melly bad off.
He can't come. There's nobody to come.
You've got to manage without the doctor. I'll help you.
Oh, Lordy, Miss Scarlett!
Well, what is it?
Lordy, we's got to have a doctor! I don't know nothing about birthing babies!
What do you mean?
I don't know..
You told me you knew everything!
I don't know why I lied!
Ma ain't never let me around when folks was having them.
Scarlett!
Scarlett!
Miss Scarlett!
Stop it!
Go light a fire on the stove. Boil water in the kettle.
Get me a ball of twine, clean towels and the scissors.
Don't tell me you can't find them! Go get them and get them quick!
Scarlett!
Scarlett!
Scarlett!
Coming, Melly. Coming!
You better go before the Yankees get here.
You know I won't leave you.
It's no use.
Don't be a goose, Melly. Hold on to me. - Hold on to me!
Talk to me, Scarlett. Please, talk to me.
Don't try to be brave. Yell! There's nobody to hear.
Ma says if you puts a knife under the bed, it cuts the pain.
Captain Butler!
Captain Butler!
Captain Butler!
Who do you want?
Captain Butler.
He's upstairs. Belle Watling's giving a party.
Captain Butler!
Oh, Captain Butler!
What's all the rumpus about?
I's got a message for Captain Butler, Mrs. Watling.
Captain Butler, you come out here in the streets to me!
What is it, Prissy?
Miss Scarlett done sent me for you.
Miss Melly, she done had her baby today.
A fine baby boy.
And Miss Scarlett and me, we brung it.
Are you telling me Scarlett..?
It was mostly me, Captain Butler. Only Miss Scarlett, she helped me a little.
But I don't expect no doctor could have done no better.
Only, Miss Melly, she feel kind of poorly now it's all over.
Yes, I can believe that.
And the Yankees is coming. And Miss Scarlett, she says..
Captain Butler, the Yankees is here! Please come and bring your carriage for us right away!
I'm sorry, but the army took my horse and carriage.
You better come upstairs. I'll see what I can do.
Oh, no, Captain Butler. Ma would wear me out with a cornstalk if I was to go into Mrs. Watling's.
Any of you beauties know where I can steal a horse for a good cause?
Whoa!
Is that you, Rhett?
We's here, Miss Scarlett!
I knew you'd come.
Nice weather we're having.
Prissy tells me you're..
If you make any jokes now, I'll kill you!
Don't tell me you're frightened?
I'm scared to death! If you had sense, you'd be scared too.
Oh, the Yankees!
No, not yet. That's what's left of our army blowing up the ammunition.
We gotta get out of here!
At your service. Where are you going?
Home, to Tara.
They've been fighting around Tara.
You're going to parade through there with a sick woman, a baby and a darkie?
Do you intend leaving them?
They're going with me, and you can't stop me!
It's dangerous jouncing Mrs. Wilkes over open country.
I want my mother! I want to go home to Tara!
Tara's probably been burned. The woods are full of stragglers. The least they'll do is take the horse.
It's not much, but I had trouble stealing it.
I'm going home if I have to walk every step of the way!
I'll kill you if you try to stop me! I will, I will! I will, I will!
All right, darling, all right. Now you shall go home.
I guess anybody who did what you've done today can take care of Sherman.
Stop crying.
Now blow your nose like a good little girl.
What're you doing?
I'm packing!
Well, stop it and come and get the baby!
Melly? - Melly?
Mrs. Wilkes? - We're taking you to Tara.
Tara?
It's the only way, Melly.
They'll burn the house over our heads if we stay.
It's all right, Melly.
My baby.
My poor baby.
Can you put your arms around my neck?
Never mind.
Ashley, Charles!
What's she want?
Ashley's picture and Charles' sword.
Get them.
What's that?
Our gallant lads set fire to the warehouses.
Enough ammunition in boxcars to blow us to Tara.
We have to get across the tracks.
Not that way!
We have to. McDonough road's the only one the Yankees haven't cut yet.
Wait, I forgot to lock the front door!
What are you laughing at?
At you, locking the Yankees out.
Oh, dear! I wish they'd hurry.
I wouldn't be in such a hurry to see them go.
With them goes the last semblance of law and order.
Scavengers aren't wasting any time.
Better get out of here fast.
There's a horse!
Give us that horse!
Down the alley! Cut him off!
Give me that horse!
Oh, Miss Scarlett!
Haven't left much to take.
We'll make a dash for it before the fire reaches that ammunition.
Come on!
Throw me your shawl.
You'll like it better if you don't see anything.
Take a good look, my dear.
It's a historic moment. Tell your grandchildren how you watched the Old South disappear one night.
They were gonna lick the Yankees in a month. The poor gallant fools.
They make me sick. Getting us all into this by swaggering and boasting.
That's the way I felt once about their "swaggering and boasting."
I'm so glad you aren't with the army.
You can be proud. Proud that you've been smarter than all of them.
I'm not so proud.
Why did you stop?
This is the turn to Tara. Let the horse breathe a bit.
Mrs. Wilkes.
Miss Melly done fainted way back, Captain Butler.
She's better off. She couldn't stand the pain if she were conscious.
Scarlett, are you still determined to do this crazy thing?
Oh, yes, yes. I know we can get through, Rhett.
Not we, my dear, you. I'm leaving you here.
You're what?
Rhett, where are you going?
I'm going to join the army.
You're joking. - I could kill you for scaring me so.
I'm very serious, Scarlett.
I'm going to join up with our brave lads in gray.
But they're running away.
They'll turn and make a last stand.
When they do, I'll be with them. - I'm a little late, but better late..
You must be joking!
Selfish to the end, aren't you?
Thinking of your own hide, never a thought for the Cause.
How could you do this to me?
And why should you go now that it's all over, and I need you? - Why? Why?
Why? I've always had a weakness for lost causes, once they're really lost.
Or maybe.. Maybe I'm ashamed of myself. Who knows?
You should die of shame to leave me alone and helpless!
You? Helpless?
Heaven help the Yankees if they capture you.
Now climb down here. - I want to say goodbye.
No!
Climb down!
Rhett, please don't go!
You can't leave me, please. I'll never forgive you!
I'm not asking you to forgive me. I'll never forgive myself.
If a bullet gets me, I'll laugh at myself for being an idiot.
There's one thing I do know, and that is I love you, Scarlett.
In spite of you and me and the world going to pieces, I love you.
Because we're alike. Bad lots, both of us.
Selfish and shrewd, but able to look things in the eye and call them by name.
Don't hold me like that!
Scarlett.. Look at me.
I love you more than I've ever loved any woman.
And I've waited longer for you than any woman.
Let me alone!
A soldier of the South loves you. Wants your arms around him.
Wants to carry the memory of your kisses into battle.
Never mind about loving me.
You're a woman sending a soldier to his death with a beautiful memory.
Scarlett, kiss me. Kiss me once.
You low-down, cowardly, nasty thing, you!
They were right. Everybody was right.
You aren't a gentleman.
A minor point at such a moment.
Here. If anyone lays a hand on that nag, shoot him. But don't make a mistake and shoot the nag.
Go on! I want you to go. I hope a cannonball blows you into a million pieces..!
Never mind the rest. I follow your general idea.
And when I'm dead on the altar of my country, I hope your conscience irks you.
Goodbye, Scarlett.
Come on, you. We're going home.
Oh, my poor baby.
Don't worry. Mother will take care of him when we get home.
Miss Scarlett, I's powerful hungry. - We's got to have something to eat.
Hush up!
We're nearly at Twelve Oaks. We'll stop there. Go on!
Oh, Ashley. Ashley, I'm glad you're not here to see this.
The Yankees.
The dirty Yankees!
Prissy! Come tie up this cow.
We don't need no cow, Miss Scarlett. We'll be home soon, and I's scared of cows.
Tie her onto the back of the wagon with your petticoat.
We need milk for the baby, and we don't know what we'll find at home.
Melly, we're home! We're at Tara. Hurry!
Miss Scarlett, it's dead!
I can't see the house. Is it there? I can't see the house.
Have they burned it?
It's all right!
It's all right! They haven't burned it.
It's still there!
Mother!
Mother, I'm home!
Mother!
Mother, I'm home!
Mother, let me in. It's me.
Oh, Pa!
I'm home. I'm home.
Katie? Katie Scarlett!
Mammy!
Mammy, I'm home.
Honey child..
Mammy, I'm so.. Where's Mother?
Why.. ..Miss Suellen, Miss Carreen, they was sick with the typhoid.
They had it bad, but they's doing all right now. - Just weak, like little kittens.
But where's Mother?
Well.. Miss Ellen. She went down to nurse that Emmie Slattery..
Then last night, she..
Mother?
Mother?
Mother?
Mother?
Miss Scarlett, honey.
If there's anything I can do, Miss Scarlett..
What did you do with Melly?
Don't worry your pretty head. I done slapped her in bed, along with the baby.
You better put that cow into the barn.
There ain't no barn no more. - Yankees burned it for firewood.
This was their headquarters.
They camped all around.
Yankees in Tara?
Yes'm, and they stole most everything they didn't burn.
All the clothes and all the rugs, and even Miss Ellen's rosaries.
I'm starving. Get me something to eat.
There ain't nothing to eat, honey. They took it all.
All the chickens? Everything?
They took them first. What they didn't eat, they carried off.
Don't tell me any more about what "they" did!
What's this, Pa?
Whiskey?
Yes, daughter.
Katie Scarlett, that's enough.
Your not knowing spirits, you'll make yourself tipsy.
I hope it makes me drunk. I'd like to be drunk.
Oh, Pa..
What are those papers?
Bonds.
They're all we've saved, all we have left. Bonds.
But what kind of bonds, Pa?
Why, Confederate bonds, of course.
Confederate bonds. What good are they to anybody?
I'll not have you talking like that.
Oh, Pa, what are we going to do with no money.. ..and nothing to eat?
We must ask your mother. That's it.
We must ask Mrs. O'Hara.
Ask Mother? - Yes.
Mrs. O'Hara will know what's to be done.
Now don't be bothering me. Go out for a ride. I'm busy.
Oh, Pa.. Don't worry about anything.
Katie Scarlett's home. You needn't worry.
What'll we do with nothing to feed those sick folks and that child?
I don't know, Mammy. I don't know.
We ain't got nothing but radishes in the garden.
Miss Scarlett, Miss Suellen and Miss Carreen.. ..they's fussing to be sponged off.
Where are the other servants?
Only just me and Pork left. The others went to war or runned away.
I can't take care of that baby and sick folkses too!
I's only got two hands.
Who's gonna milk that cow, Miss Scarlett?
We's houseworkers.
As God is my witness.. As God is my witness, they're not going to lick me.
I'm going to live through this, and when it's all over.. ..I'll never be hungry again.
No, nor any of my folk.
If I have to lie, steal, cheat, or kill..
..as God is my witness, I'll never be hungry again!
My back's near broken.
Look at my hands! Mother said you could always tell a lady by her hands.
I guess things like hands and ladies don't matter so much anymore.
Rest, Sue. You're not well yet. I can pick cotton for both of us.
Scarlett's hateful!
Making us work in the fields..
Too bad about that. Get back to work.
I can't do everything at Tara myself.
What do I care about Tara? I hate Tara!
Don't you ever dare say you hate Tara again!
It's the same as hating Pa and Ma.
There's something I must speak to you about.
What is it?
I don't like the way you're treating Prissy and Mammy.
You must be firm with inferiors, but gentle with them.
Especially darkies. I know.
But I'm not asking them to do what I don't do myself.
Nevertheless, I don't like it. I shall speak to Mrs. O'Hara about it.
What are you doing out of bed?
You're all working so hard. I can't just lie in bed.
Go upstairs. You're as weak as a newborn colt.
Please, let me.
Stop being noble.
I don't need you making yourself sick so you'll never be any use.
Oh, I didn't think of it that way.
Who's there? Halt or I'll shoot!
You all alone, little lady?
You ain't very friendly, are you?
You got anything else besides these earbobs?
You Yankees have been here before.
Regular little spitfire, ain't you?
What do you got hidden in your hand?
Scarlett, you killed him.
I'm glad you killed him.
Scarlett, what happened? What is it, Scarlett?
What is it?
Don't be scared!
Your sister was cleaning a revolver and it went off and scared her.
Thank goodness! - We got enough to frighten us.
Tell Katie Scarlett she must be more careful.
What a cool liar you are, Melly.
We gotta get him out of here and bury him. If the Yankees find him here..
I didn't see anyone else. I think he must be a deserter.
Even so, we've gotta hide him.
They might hear about it, and then they'd come and get you.
I could bury him in the arbor where the ground is soft..
..but how will I get him out of here?
We'll both take a leg and drag him.
You couldn't drag a cat.
Scarlett.. Would it be dishonest if we went through his haversack?
I'm ashamed I didn't think of that myself.
You take the haversack. I'll search his pockets.
You look. I'm feeling a little weak.
I think it's full of money.
Melly, look. Just look!
Ten, 20, 30..
Don't stop to count it now.
We haven't got time!
Do you realize this means we can eat?
Look in his other pockets.
Hurry, hurry! We've got to get him out of here.
If he bleeds across the yard, we can't hide it.
Give me your nightgown. I'll wad it round his head.
Don't be silly, I won't look at you.
If I had on pantalets, I'd use them.
Thank heavens I'm not that modest.
Now go back to bed. You'll be dead if you don't.
I'll clean up my mess when I've buried him.
No, I'll clean it up.
Well, I guess I've done murder.
I won't think about that now. I'll think about that tomorrow.
Katie Scarlett!
It's over! It's over!
It's all over, the war. Lee surrendered!
It's not possible.
Why did we ever fight?
Ashley will be coming home.
Yes, Ashley will be coming home.
We'll plant more cotton. Cotton ought to go sky-high next year.
The flag that makes you free
So we sing the chorus From Atlanta to the sea
While we were marching through Georgia
Get out of the road, rebel!
Have you room for a dying man?
Not for any Southern scum, alive or dead. Get out of the way!
I reckon he'd rather try and walk it, at that.
Jump, you gray-backed beggars!
Acts like they won the war.
You come on, give me them pants, Mr. Kennedy. Come on!
Scrub yourself with that lye soap, 'fore I scrub you myself.
I'm gonna put these britches in the boiling pot.
The whole army's got the same troubles.. ..crawling clothes and dysentery.
It's humiliating how you're treating him.
You'd be a sight more humiliated if Mr. Kennedy's lice gets on you.
Oh, come on, Beau! We must leave this gentleman alone because he's tired and he's hungry.
I don't mind, ma'am. Good to see a youngster again. Nice little fella.
Another two years, and we could've had him in Cobb's Legion.
Were you in Cobb's Legion?
Yes, ma'am.
Why, then, you must know my husband, Major Wilkes?
Oh, yes, ma'am. He was captured at Spotsylvania, I think.
Captured?
Oh, thank heaven! Then he isn't..
My poor Ashley, in a Yankee prison.
Melanie?
Yes, Scarlett, I'm coming. Come along, Beau.
I'll watch out for him. We're good friends.
Thank you.
I slave day and night just so we can have enough food..
..and you give it away to scarecrows.
I'd sooner have a plague of locusts.
Don't scold me, Scarlett.
I've just heard that Ashley was taken prisoner.
Ashley a prisoner?
Yes. And maybe if he's alive and well, he's on some Northern road right now.
Maybe a Northern woman is giving him some of her dinner..
..and helping my beloved to come back home to me.
I hope so, Melly.
Miss Scarlett?
I want to take up something with your Pa, but he doesn't seem to..
Perhaps I can help you. I'm head of the house now.
Well, I.. I.. Miss Scarlett, I was aiming to ask for Suellen.
Are you telling me you haven't asked for her after all these years?
The truth is, I'm so much older than she is.. ..and now I haven't a cent to my name.
Who has, nowadays?
Miss Scarlett, if true love carries any weight with you.. ..you can be sure your sister will be rich in that.
I'd go and get myself a little business, if we're engaged. - As soon as I'm on my feet again..
All right, Frank. I'm sure I can speak for Pa. You go ask her now.
Thank you. Thank you, Miss Scarlett.
Excuse me, Mrs. Wilkes. Excuse me.
What seems to be the trouble with Mr. Kennedy?
More trouble than he guesses.
He's finally asked for Suellen's hand.
Oh, I'm so glad.
It's a pity he can't marry her now. It'd be one less mouth to feed.
Oh, another one!
Hope this one isn't hungry.
He'll be hungry.
I'll tell Prissy to get an extra plate..
Ashley!
Ashley!
Miss Scarlett! Don't spoil it.
Turn me loose, you fool. Turn me loose! It's Ashley!
He's her husband, ain't he?
Miss Scarlett?
High time you got back.
Did you get the horse shod?
Yes'm, he's shod.
Fine thing, horses get shoes and humans can't. Here, stir this soap.
Miss Scarlett, ma'am? I gotta know how much money have you got left. In gold.
Ten dollars. Why?
That won't be enough. What are you talking about?
Well, I see'd that old no-count white-trash Wilkerson.. ..that used to be Mr. Gerald's overseer here.
He's a regular Yankee now, and he was making a brag..
..that his Carpetbagger friends run the taxes way up sky-high on Tara.
How much more we got to pay?
I hear the taxman say $300.
Three hundred..!
It might just as well be 3 million.
But we gotta raise it, that's all.
Yes'm.
How?
I'll go ask Mr. Ashley.
He ain't got no $300.
Well, I can ask him if I want to, can't I?
Asking ain't getting.
Ashley..
They say Abe Lincoln got his start splitting rails.
Just think what heights I may climb to, once I get the knack.
Ashley, the Yankees want $300 more in taxes.
What shall we do?
Ashley, what's to become of us?
What becomes of people when their civilization breaks up?
Those with brains and courage come through all right. Those that haven't are winnowed out.
For heaven's sake.. ..don't talk nonsense when it's us being winnowed out!
You're right, Scarlett.
Here I am talking tommyrot about civilization.. ..while your Tara is in danger.
You've come to me for help, and I've none to give.
Oh, Scarlett, I'm a coward.
You, Ashley? A coward?
What are you afraid of?
Mostly of life becoming too real for me, I suppose.
Not that I mind splitting rails.
But I do mind very much losing the beauty of that life I loved.
If the war hadn't come, I'd have spent my life happily buried at Twelve Oaks. But the war did come.
I saw my boyhood friends blown to bits. I saw men crumple up in agony when I shot them.
And now I find myself in a world which for me is worse than death.
A world in which there's no place for me.
I can't make you understand. You don't know the meaning of fear.
You never mind facing realities.
You never want to escape from them as I do.
Escape?
Ashley, you're wrong. I do want to escape too.
I'm so very tired of it all.
I've struggled for food and for money.
I've weeded, hoed and picked cotton till I can't stand it.
I tell you, the South is dead. It's dead!
The Yankees and Carpetbaggers have it and left nothing for us.
Oh, Ashley.. Let's run away.
We'd go to Mexico. They want officers in the Mexican army. We'd be happy.
I'd work for you. I'd do anything for you!
You don't love Melanie.
You said you loved me at Twelve Oaks.
And anyway, Melanie can't..
Dr. Meade said she can't have more children. I could give you..
Can't we ever forget Twelve Oaks?
You think I could ever forget?
Have you?
Can you honestly say you don't love me?
No, I don't love you.
It's a lie!
Even so, do you think I'd leave Melanie and the baby?
You couldn't leave your father and the girls.
I'm sick of them. I'm tired of them!
Yes, you're sick and tired. That's why you're talking this way.
You've carried the load for all of us. From now on, I'll be more help to you. I promise.
There's only one way you can help me.
Take me away. There's nothing to keep us here.
Nothing? Nothing except honor.
Please, Scarlett. Please, dear. You mustn't cry.
You mustn't. Please, my brave dear, you mustn't.
You do love me! You do love me!
No, don't, don't.
You love me. We won't do this.
I tell you, we won't do it!
It won't happen again. I'll take Melanie and go.
Say it. You love me.
All right, I'll say it. I love your courage and stubbornness so much that I could forget..
..the best wife a man ever had.
But I'm not going to forget her!
Then there's nothing left for me.
Nothing to fight for. Nothing to live for.
Yes, there is something. Something you love better than me.. ..though you may not know it.
Tara.
Yes. I still have this.
You needn't go.
I won't have you all starve, simply because I threw myself at your head.
It won't happen again.
It's Emmie Slattery.
Yes'm, it's me.
Stop!
You haven't forgotten your old overseer, have you?
Emmie's Mrs. Wilkerson now.
Get off those steps, you wench!
Get off this land!
You can't speak that way to my wife.
Wife?
High time you made her your wife.
Who baptized your brats after you killed my mother?
We came out here to pay a call. A friendly call, and talk business with old friends.
Friends? When were we ever friends?
Still high and mighty, ain't you? Well, I know all about you.
Your father's turned idiot.
You can't pay your taxes, and I come to offer to buy the place from you. To make you a right good offer.
Emmie wants to live here.
Get off this place, you dirty Yankee!
You'll see who's running things when you're sold out for taxes.
I'll buy this place and I'll live in it! But I'll wait for the sheriff's sale.
That's all of Tara you'll ever get!
You'll be sorry for that.
We'll be back!
I'll show you who the owner of Tara is!
Pa, come back!
Pa, come back!
Yankee coward!
Lordy, Miss Scarlett, that's Mr. Gerald's watch!
You take it. It's for you. Pa'd want you to have it.
You ain't got no business parting from this watch now.
You needs all your valuables to sell for that tax money.
Do you think I'd sell Pa's watch?
And don't cry.
I can stand everybody's tears but yours.
Oh, Mammy, Mammy!
You've been brave so long. You just gotta go on being brave.
Think about your Pa like he used to be.
I can't think about Pa. I can't think of anything but that $300.
Ain't no good thinking about that. Ain't nobody got that much money.
Nobody but Yankees and Scalawags got that much money now.
Rhett.
Who that?
A Yankee?
Oh, Mammy, I'm so thin and pale.. ..and I haven't any clothes.
Go and get Ma's old box of dress patterns.
What you up to?
You'll make me a new dress.
Not with Miss Ellen's portières!
Great balls of fire! They're my portières now.
I'm going to Atlanta for $300, and I've got to look like a queen.
Who's going with you?
I'll go alone.
That's what you think!
I's going with you and that new dress.
Mammy, darling.
No use to try to sweet talk me.
I knows you since I put diapers on you.
I said I's going with you, and going I is!
Kings in trade, eh? Too good for me, major.
It's a pity the war wasn't a poker game.
You'd done better than Grant, with far less effort.
What is it?
There's a lady to see Captain Butler. Says she's his sister.
Another sister?
This is a jail not a harem, captain.
No, she ain't one of those. She's got her mammy with her.
She has?
I'd like to see this one, major. Without her mammy.
Let's see, my losses for the afternoon come to what?
Three hundred and forty?
My debts do mount up, don't they, major?
All right, corporal, show Captain Butler's "sister" to his cell.
Thank you, major. Excuse me, gentlemen.
It's hard to be strict with a man who loses money so pleasantly.
Rhett!
Scarlett! My dear little sister!
It's all right, corporal. My sister has brought me no files or saws.
Can I really kiss you?
On the forehead, like a good brother.
No, thanks. I'll wait and hope for better things.
I was so distressed when I heard you were in jail. I couldn't sleep for thinking.
It's not true they'll hang you?
Would you be sorry?
Oh, Rhett.
Well, don't worry yet.
They trumped up a charge, but they really want my money.
They think I made off with the Confederate treasury.
Well, did you?
What a leading question.
Let's not talk about things like money.
How good of you to come and see me. And how pretty you look!
How you do run on, teasing a country girl like me.
Thank heavens you're not in rags. I'm tired of women in rags.
Turn around.
You look good enough to eat, and prosperous.
I've been doing very well.
Everyone's well at Tara, only.. ..I got so bored, I thought I'd treat myself to a visit to town.
You're heartless, but that's part of your charm.
You've got more charm than the law allows.
I didn't come to talk silliness about me.
I was so miserable at the thought of you in trouble.
I was mad at you when you left me on the road to Tara. - And I still haven't forgiven you.
Don't say that.
Well, I must admit I might not be alive now, only for you.
When I think of myself with anything I could possibly hope for..
..not a care in the world, and you here in this horrid jail. And not even a human jail, Rhett, a horse jail!
Listen to me trying to make jokes.. ..when I really want to cry.
In a minute I shall cry.
Scarlett.. Can it be possible that..?
Can what be possible, Rhett?
That you've grown a woman's heart? A real woman's heart.
I have, Rhett. I know I have.
It's worth being in jail just to hear you say that.
It's well worth it.
You can drop the moonlight and magnolia. Things have been going well at Tara?
What've you done with your hands?
I went riding without my gloves..
You've been working like a field hand!
Why did you lie, and what are you up to?
I almost believed you cared.
But I do care!
Let's get down to the truth.
You want something enough.. ..to put on quite a show in your velvets.
What is it?
I want $300 to pay the taxes on Tara. I lied when I said everything was all right.
Things are as bad as they possibly could be. And you've got millions.
What collateral do you have?
My earbobs. - Not interested.
Mortgage on Tara.
What would I do with a farm?
I'd pay you out of next year's cotton.
Not good enough.
You once said you loved me.
If you still love me..
You haven't forgotten, I'm not a marrying man.
No, I haven't forgotten.
You're not worth $300. You'll never mean anything but misery to any man.
I don't care what you say, only give me the money.
I won't let Tara go! I can't while there's a breath left in my body.
Oh, Rhett, won't you please give me the money?
I couldn't if I wanted to.
My funds are in Liverpool, not Atlanta.
If I drew a draft, they'd be on me like a duck on a June bug.
So you see, my dear, you've abased yourself to no purpose.
Here, here. Stop it!
You want the Yankees to see you like this?
Take your hands off me, you skunk!
You knew what I wanted.
You knew you wouldn't lend me the money and you let me go on!
I enjoyed hearing what you had to say.
Cheer up. Come to my hanging, I'll put you in my will.
I'll come to your hanging!
I'm just afraid they won't hang you in time to pay the taxes on Tara!
Tell him Belle Watling.
Where you been? I thought you deserted Captain Butler.
I keep myself occupied.
Who that?
I ain't never see'd hair that color before in my life.
You know a dyed-haired woman?
Wish I knew that one. She'd get my money for me.
Whatever they done to you in there..
..they didn't do no more than you deserve for visiting white trash.
Fresh and green.
Right off the farm.
What you doing tonight, Susie?
That's a Georgia peach!
Nothing like that in Ohio.
You know what we'll do?
What?
We're gonna give every one of you 40 acres and a mule.
And a mule?
Forty acres and a mule!
Gee!
Because we're your friend.
And you're gonna become voters and vote like your friends do!
What's your hurry?
What's come over this town?
Yankees have come over it. Same as they've come over all of them.
Get out of the way here!
Get away! Go on.
It can't be Miss Scarlett!
Frank Kennedy!
And Mammy.
It's good to see home folks.
I didn't know you were here.
I didn't know you were.
Didn't Suellen tell you about my store?
Did she? I don't remember.
This?
Won't you come in, look around a bit?
I don't suppose it looks like much to a lady.. ..but I can't help being proud of it.
You're not making money?
Well, I can't complain.
In fact, I'm mighty encouraged. Folks tell me I'm just a born merchant.
Won't be long before Miss Suellen and I can marry.
Are you doing as well as all that?
Yes, I am.
I'm no millionaire yet.. ..but I've cleared $1000 already.
And lumber too.
That's only a sideline.
A sideline, Frank?
With all the good Georgia pine around Atlanta, and all this building?
Well, all that takes money, Miss Scarlett.. ..and I gotta think about buying a home.
Why would you want a home?
For Suellen to set up housekeeping.
Here in Atlanta.
You'd want to bring her to Atlanta.
There wouldn't be much help in that for Tara.
I don't know what you mean.
I don't mean a thing.
How'd you like to drive me to my Aunt Pitty's?
Nothing'd give me more pleasure.
You better stay to supper. Aunt Pitty'd be agreeable, and I'd like a long visit.
You act on me just like a tonic, Miss Scarlett.
And will you tell me all the news.. ..of Miss Suellen?
What's the matter?
Miss Suellen's not ill, is she?
Oh, no, no. I thought surely she had written you.
I guess she was ashamed to write you. She should be ashamed.
How awful to have such a mean sister.
You must tell me. Don't leave me on tenterhooks.
Well, she's going to marry one of the county boys next month.
She got tired of waiting, was afraid she'd be an old maid and..
Oh, I'm sorry to be the one to tell you.
It's cold, and I left my muff at home. Would you mind if I put my hand in your pocket?
But, Melanie, you don't realize what she's done!
She's gone and married my Mr. Kennedy!
He's my beau and she's married him!
She did it to save Tara.
I hate Tara!
I hate Scarlett!
She's the only thing I hate worse than Tara!
It's all my fault.
I should've committed robbery to get that tax money for you.
I couldn't let you do anything like that. Anyway, it's done now.
Yes, it's done now.
You won't let me do anything dishonorable.. ..yet you'd sell yourself in marriage to a man you didn't love.
You won't have to worry about my helplessness anymore.
What do you mean?
I'm going to New York.
I've arranged for a position in a bank.
But you can't do that.
I counted on you to help me start a lumber business and.. I counted on you.
I don't know anything about the lumber business.
You know as much as you do about banking.. ..and I'd give you half the business.
That's generous of you, Scarlett.
But it isn't that.
If I go to Atlanta and take help from you again.. ..I'd bury any hope of ever standing alone.
Oh, is that all? You could gradually buy the business, and then it would be your own and..
No, Scarlett.
Ashley!
Ashley!
Scarlett? Scarlett, what is it?
Ashley's so mean and hateful!
What have you done?
She wanted me to go to Atlanta.
To help me start my lumber business. And he won't help me!
How unchivalrous of you.
Why, think, Ashley, think! If it hadn't been for Scarlett, I'd have died in Atlanta..
..and maybe we wouldn't have little Beau.
When I think of her picking cotton and plowing.. ..just to keep food in our mouths, I could just..
Oh, my darling.
All right, Melanie. I'll go to Atlanta.
I can't fight you both.
Come on, lift them feet!
There's your new mill hands, Mrs. Kennedy. The pick of all the best jails in Georgia.
They look thin and weak.
Halt!
They're the best you can lease.
If you'll give Johnnie Gallegher a free hand.. ..you'll get what you want out of them.
All right, you're the foreman.
Just keep the mill running and deliver my lumber when I want it.
Johnnie Gallegher's your man, miss. But remember.. ..no questions and no interference.
That's a bargain. Start in the morning.
Come on, get a move on there!
But this isn't right, and you know it.
Bad enough to be a businesswoman..
Why do you complain?
You wouldn't own a mill if I didn't take over.
But I didn't want the mill.
We couldn't buy it if you hadn't pressed our friends for their debts.
Isn't that right, Ashley?
Are you running a charitable institution?
Go back to the store, and go home and take your medicine.
Sugar, don't you think..? Great balls of fire!
Don't bother me.
And don't call me "sugar." All right.
All right.
Good night, Ashley.
My, my! She can get mad quicker than any woman I ever saw.
I don't like to interfere..
..but I wish you'd let me hire darkies and not use convicts. We could do better.
Darkies' pay would break us. Convicts are cheap. If we give Gallegher a free hand..
A free hand? That means he'll starve and whip them.
Didn't you see them?
Some are sick.
How you do run on. If I let you alone, you'd give them chicken..
..and tuck them in with quilts.
I won't make money out of the enforced labor and misery of others.
You didn't mind owning slaves.
That was different. We didn't treat them that way.
I'd have freed them when father died.. ..if the war hadn't already freed them.
Oh, I'm sorry, Ashley. Do you forget what it's like without money?
Money is the most important thing in the world. I don't intend to be without it again.
I'll make enough the only way I know how so the Yankees can't take Tara.
We're not the only Southerners who've suffered.
Look at all our friends. They're keeping their honor and kindness.
And they're starving.
I've no use for fools who won't help themselves.
I know what they say about me. I don't care.
I'll befriend Carpetbaggers and beat them at their own game. And you'll beat them with me.
That's it. Pull it a little over to that side.
Afternoon, Mrs. Kennedy.
Good afternoon.
Business is certainly growing.
It certainly is.
You're doing business with the people.. ..who robbed us, tortured us and left us to starve.
All that's past. I intend to make the best of things, even if they are Yankee things.
And do you know that Dr. Meade actually saw her.. - ..peddling lumber to Yankees herself?
That isn't all.
It's shocking what she's doing to my brother.
She's even taken to driving her own buggy.
My dear Mrs. Kennedy.
My very dear Mrs. Kennedy!
I don't see how you have the gall to face me!
You could've had my millions if you'd just waited a while.
Oh, how fickle is woman!
What is it you want?
I have things to do.
Will you satisfy my curiosity on a point which has always bothered me?
Well, what is it?
Tell me, do you never shrink from marrying men you don't love?
How'd you get out of jail?
Why didn't they hang you?
Oh, that! There's nothing much that money won't buy.
I observe it's even bought you the honorable Mr. Wilkes.
So you still hate Ashley Wilkes. I believe you're jealous of him.
You still think you're the belle of the county, the cutest trick in shoe leather.
That every man is in love with you. - Let me by.
Don't be angry. Tell me, where are you going?
I'm going out to the mill.
Through Shantytown alone?
It's dangerous to drive alone through all that riffraff.
Don't worry about me.
I can shoot straight, if I don't have to shoot too far.
What a woman!
Give me a quarter.
Let go of my horse!
Hold this horse.
Let go! - Give me that gun.
Help!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Miss Scarlett!
Wait! Miss Scarlett, wait!
Miss Scarlett! Miss Scarlett!
It's Sam! - Big Sam?
Miss Scarlett, wait!
Sam! Sam!
Is you hurt, Miss Scarlett?
Did they hurt you?
Don't you cry. Big Sam will get you out of this in a jiffy.
Horse, make tracks!
Get to Tara as quick as you can and stay there.
I will. I's had enough of them Carpetbaggers.
Thank you, Mr. Frank. Goodbye, Miss Scarlett.
Goodbye, Sam. Thank you.
Change your dress and go over to Miss Melly's. I've got to go to a political meeting.
How can you go to a political meeting after what I've been through?
You're more scared than hurt.
Nobody cares about me. You all act as though it were nothing at all.
The men talk about protecting our women..
..and then after what happened to me, Frank went to a political meeting.
And if it won't pain you too much, India Wilkes.. ..tell me why you're staring at me.
Has my face gone green?
It won't pain me. What happened today was just what you deserved.
With any justice, you'd have gotten worse.
India, hush up.
Let her talk. She's always hated me.
Ever since I took Charles away, though she won't admit it.
If she thought anybody'd notice, she'd walk the street naked.
I do hate you! You've done all you could to lower the prestige of decent people.
Now you've endangered the lives of our men.. ..because they've got to..
India!
We'd better not say any more, or one of us will be saying too much.
What's going on that I don't know about?
Somebody's coming up the walk. Somebody that ain't Mr. Ashley.
Will you hand me the pistol, Mrs. Meade?
Whoever it is.. ..we know nothing.
Where have they gone?
Tell me. It's life or death.
Don't tell him. He's a Yankee spy. Quickly.
There may be time.
How'd you know?
I played poker with Yankees.
They knew there'd be trouble. They sent the cavalry out.
Your men are walking into a trap.
Don't tell him. He's trying to trap you.
Out the Decatur road. The old Sullivan plantation. They're meeting in the cellar.
I'll do what I can.
What's this about?
If you don't tell me, I'll go crazy.
We thought it best not to tell you.
The men have gone to clean out the woods where you were attacked.
It's what many of our Southern men have had to do to protect us.
And if they're captured, they'll be hanged. And it will be your fault.
Another word and you leave, India. Scarlett did what she had to do.
Our men are doing what they think they have to do.
Frank.. ..and Ashley.
Oh, it isn't possible.
There's horses, Miss Melly. Here they come.
We're sewing, we're sewing!
Open the door.
Good evening, Mrs. Kennedy.
Who is Mrs. Wilkes? I am Mrs. Wilkes.
I should like to speak to Mr. Wilkes.
He's not here.
Are you sure?
Don't you doubt Miss Melly's word!
I meant no disrespect, Mrs. Wilkes.
If you give me your word, I won't search the house.
Mr. Wilkes is at a political meeting at Mr. Kennedy's store.
He's not at the store. There's no meeting tonight, no political meeting.
We'll wait outside till he and his friends return.
Surround the house. Put a man on each door and window.
Keep on with your sewing, ladies.
And I'll read aloud.
The Personal History and Experience of David Copperfield."
Chapter One." "I am born."
To begin my life with the beginning of my life, I record that I was born.."
Chapter Nine. I have a memorable birthday."
I pass over all that happened at school.." "..until the anniversary of my birthday came round in March."
Except that Steerforth was more to be admired than ever, I remember nothing."
He was going away at the end of the half-year.."
..if not sooner, and was more spirited and independent than before."
But beyond this, I remember nothing."
The great.."
I remember nothing."
Melly, they're drunk!
Leave this to me, Scarlett. And, please, say nothing.
You stupid fool!
Shh!
Quiet!
Will you shut up, for the love of..
Hello, Melly.
So you've got my husband intoxicated again.
Well, bring him in.
I'm sorry, your husband's under arrest.
If you arrest all the drunks in Atlanta, you must arrest a good many Yankees.
Bring him in, Captain Butler, if you can walk yourself.
Wait. - I wanna tell you a story.
Listen, doctor, I..
Put him down in that chair.
Now, captain, please leave my house.. ..and try to remember not to come here again.
That's fine thanks I get for bringing him home.. ..and not leaving him in this shameful condition.
Now, boys, all together..
Dr. Meade! I'm astonished at you!
Oh, Ashley! How can you do this to me?
I ain't so very drunk, Melly.
Take him to the bedroom. Lay him out on the bed.
Don't touch him. He's under arrest.
Now, Tom. What do you want to arrest him for?
I've seen him drunker.
I've seen you drunker. And you've seen me..
He can lie in the gutter for all I care. I'm not a policeman.
He led a raid on that Shantytown where Mrs. Kennedy got into trouble.
A lot of shanties were burned. A couple of men were killed.
It's time you rebels learned you can't take the law into your own hands.
What are you laughing at?
This isn't your night to teach that lesson. These two have been with me tonight. Yes, sir.
With you, Rhett?
Where?
I don't like to say in the presence of ladies.
You'd better say.
Come out on the porch and I'll tell you.
Speak out. I think I have a right to know where my husband's been.
Well, ma'am..
..we dropped in on a friend of mine.. ..and the captain's.
A Mrs. Belle Watling. We played cards and drank champagne, and, well..
Now you've done it. Did you have to show me up in front of my wife?
Now, I hope you're satisfied.
These ladies won't be speaking with their husbands.
Well, Rhett, I had no idea. Look here, will you take an oath that they were with you tonight at Belle's?
Ask Belle if you don't believe me. She'll tell you.
Will you give me your word, as a gentleman?
As a gentleman?
Why, certainly, Tom.
Well, if I've made a mistake, I'm sorry. I hope you'll forgive me, Mrs. Wilkes.
If you'll leave us in peace.
Well, I say I'm sorry. Well, I am sorry.
Come on, sergeant.
Lock that door. Pull down the shades.
Ashley!
He's all right. It's only in the shoulder. Get him on the bed where I can dress the wound.
I think I can walk.
It's not worth the effort. Which way?
In here.
Mammy, I want hot water. And lint for bandages.
What can I use for a probe? If I only had my bag.
Were you really there?
What did it look like?
Does she have cut-glass chandeliers, plush curtains and dozens of mirrors?
Good heavens, Mrs. Meade, remember yourself.
Captain Butler, tell me what happened, all that happened.
I was too late. When I got to the Sullivan place, there had already been a skirmish.
I found Mr. Wilkes wounded, and Dr. Meade was with him.
I had to prove they'd been somewhere, anyplace but where they were. - So I took them to Belle's.
And she took them in?
She's by way of being an old friend of mine.
Oh, I'm sorry..
I'm sorry I couldn't think up a more dignified alibi.
This isn't the first time you've come between me and disaster.
It isn't likely that I'd question any device of yours.
And now I'll go and see what Dr. Meade needs.
Oh, Ashley..
Ashley..
Have you no interest in what's become of your own husband?
Did Frank go with you to Belle Watling's?
No.
Well, where is he?
He's lying out on Decatur Road..
..shot through the head. He's dead.
Who is it?
It's Mrs. Watling.
Oh, Mrs. Watling. Won't you come in the house?
Oh, no, I couldn't do that, Mrs. Wilkes. You come in and sit a minute with me.
How can I thank you enough for what you did for us?
I got your note saying you would call on me and thank me. Why, Mrs. Wilkes, you must have lost your mind.
I came as soon as it was dark to say you mustn't think of any such thing.
Why, I'm.. Well, you're..
It wouldn't be fitting at all.
It wouldn't be fitting for me to thank a woman who saved my husband's life?
Mrs. Wilkes, there ain't never been a lady nice to me like you was.
I mean, about the money for the hospital. I don't forget a kindness.
I thought about you being widowed with a little boy.. ..if Mr. Wilkes got hung.
He's a nice little boy, your boy is, Mrs. Wilkes.
I got a boy myself, so I..
You have? Does he live..?
Oh, no, he ain't here in Atlanta. He ain't never been here.
He's off at school.
I ain't seen him since he was little.
Anyways, if it had been that Mrs. Kennedy's husband by hisself.. ..I wouldn't have lifted a finger, no matter what Rhett said.
She's a mighty cold woman.. ..prancing about Atlanta by herself.
She killed her husband same as if she shot him.
You mustn't say unkind things about my sister-in-law.
Please don't freeze me, Mrs. Wilkes. I forgot how you liked her.
She just ain't in the same class with you, and I can't help it if I think so.
Well, anyways, I gotta be going.
I'm scared somebody'll recognize this carriage if I stay any longer.
That wouldn't do you no good.
And, Mrs. Wilkes, if you ever see me on the street.. ..you don't have to speak to me. I'll understand.
I should be proud to speak to you. Proud to be under obligation to you.
I hope we meet again.
Oh, no. That wouldn't be fitting. - Good night, Mrs. Wilkes.
Good night, Mrs. Watling.
And you're wrong about Mrs. Kennedy. She's brokenhearted about her husband.
Great balls of fire!
It's Rhett.
Captain Butler's here. I told him you was prostrate with grief.
Tell him I'll be right down, Mammy.
She says she's coming.
I don't know why she's coming, but she's coming.
You don't like me, Mammy. Don't you argue with me.
You don't. You really don't.
It's no good, Scarlett.
What?
The cologne.
I don't know what you mean.
I mean you've been drinking. Brandy. Quite a lot.
Well, what if I have?
Is that any of your affair?
Don't drink alone. People always find out, and it ruins a reputation.
What is it?
This is more than losing old Frank.
Oh, Rhett, I'm so afraid.
I don't believe it. You've never been afraid.
I'm afraid now. I'm afraid of dying and going to hell.
You look pretty healthy. And maybe there isn't any hell.
Oh, there is. I know there is. I was raised on it.
Far be it from me to question the teachings of childhood.
Tell me what you've done that hell yawns before you.
I ought never to have married Frank.
He was Suellen's beau, and he loved her, not me.
And I made him miserable, and I killed him.
Yes, I did. I killed him. Rhett, for the first time..
Dry your eyes.
If you had it all to do over again, you'd do no differently.
You're like the thief who isn't sorry he stole.. ..but he's terribly sorry he's going to jail.
I'm glad Mother's dead.
I'm glad she's dead so she can't see me.
I always wanted to be like her, calm and kind..
..and sadly, I've turned out disappointing.
You know, Scarlett, I think you're on the verge of a crying jag.
So I'll change the subject and say what I came to say.
Say it, then, and get out!
What is it?
I can't go on any longer without you.
You really are the most ill-bred man to come here at a time..
I made up my mind you were the only woman for me.. ..the first day I saw you.
Now you have a mill and Frank's money.. ..and won't come to me as you did to the jail.
So I see I shall have to marry you.
I never heard of such bad taste.
Would you be convinced if I fell to my knees?
Turn me loose and get out.
Forgive me for startling you with my impetuous sentiments.. ..my dear Scarlett.. I mean, my dear Mrs. Kennedy.
But you must have noticed that for some time.. ..the friendship I've felt for you has ripened into a deeper feeling.
A feeling more beautiful, more pure, more sacred..
Dare I name it? Can it be love?
Get up off your knees. I don't like your common jokes.
This is an honorable proposal of marriage.. ..made at what I consider a most opportune moment.
I can't go all my life waiting to catch you between husbands.
You're coarse and you're conceited.
And I think this conversation's gone far enough.
Besides, I shall never marry again.
Oh, yes, you will. And you'll marry me.
You? You?
I don't love you.
And I don't like being married.
Ever think of marrying just for fun?
Marriage, fun?
Fiddle-dee-dee! Fun for men, you mean.
Do you want them to hear you?
You've been married to a boy and an old man.
Why not try a husband of the right age, with a way with women?
You're a fool, Rhett Butler.. ..when you know I shall always love another man.
Stop it. You hear me? Stop it.
No more of that talk.
Don't. I shall faint.
I want you to faint. This is what you're meant for.
None of those fools have kissed you like this.
Your Charles or your Frank or your stupid Ashley.
Say you're going to marry me. Say yes. Say yes.
Yes.
Are you sure you meant it?
You don't want to take it back?
No.
Look at me, and try to tell me the truth. Did you say yes because of my money?
Well, yes, partly.
Partly?
Well, you know, Rhett, money does help. - And, of course, I am fond of you.
Fond of me?
If I said I was madly in love with you, you'd know I was lying.
You say we have a lot in common..
Yes, you're right, my dear.
I'm not in love any more than you are.
Heaven help the man who ever really loves you.
What kind of ring would you like?
A diamond ring, and do buy a great big one.
You'll have the biggest and most vulgar ring in Atlanta.
I'll take you to New Orleans for the most expensive honeymoon.
That'd be heavenly.
I'll buy your trousseau for you too.
How wonderful.. ..but you won't tell anybody, will you?
Still the little hypocrite.
Won't you kiss me goodbye?
You've had enough kissing for one afternoon.
You're impossible. You can go.
I don't care if you never come back.
But I will come back.
What are you thinking about, Scarlett?
I'm thinking about how rich we are.
I can keep the lumber business too?
Yes, of course you can, if it amuses you.
Now that you're so rich, you can tell everybody to go to the devil.
But you were the main one I wanted to go to the devil.
Don't scrape the plate. I'm sure there's more in the kitchen.
Oh, Rhett, can I have a chocolate one stuffed with meringue?
If you don't stop being a glutton, you'll get as fat as Mammy. And I'll divorce you.
It'd be nice if you bought something for Mammy.
Why should I buy her a present when she called us both mules?
Mules? Why mules?
She said we could give ourselves air and get slicked up like racehorses..
..but we were just mules in horse harness and we didn't fool anybody.
I never heard anything more true. Mammy's a smart old soul.
And one of the few people I know whose respect I'd like to have.
I won't give her a thing.
Then I'll take her a petticoat.
My mammy said when she went to heaven.. ..she wanted a red taffeta petticoat so stiff that it'd stand by itself..
..and so rustley the Lord would say it's made of angels' wings.
She won't take it from you. She'd rather die than wear it.
That may be. But I'm making the gesture just the same.
Wake up. Wake up!
You were having another nightmare.
Oh, Rhett. Rhett, I was so cold and hungry and so tired.
I couldn't find it. I ran through the mist and I couldn't find it.
Find what, honey?
I don't know.
I always dream the same dream, and I never know. It seems to be hidden in the mist.
Darling..
Oh, Rhett, do you think I'll ever dream that I found it, and that I'm safe?
Dreams don't work that way.
But when you get used to being safe and warm.. ..you'll stop dreaming that dream.
And, Scarlett, I'm going to see that you are safe.
Rhett, would you do something for me if I asked you?
You know I would.
Will you take me away from here?
Don't you like New Orleans?
I love New Orleans.. ..but I want to go home and visit Tara.
Will you take me to Tara?
Yes, Scarlett. Of course I will. We'll go tomorrow.
You get your strength from this red earth of Tara.
You're part of it and it's part of you.
I'd give anything to have Tara the way it was before the war.
Would you? Go ahead and make it that way.
Spend whatever you want. Make it as fine a plantation as it ever was.
Oh, Rhett! Rhett, you are good to me.
Can we still have our big new house in Atlanta? Yes.
And it can be as ornate as you want.
Marble terraces, stained-glass windows.
Won't everyone be jealous!
I want everybody who's been mean to me to be pea-green with envy.
I don't care. Scarlett's hateful..
..building that new house just to show off! And even taking our servants!
Oh, darling, you mustn't think unkindly of her. She's made it possible for us to keep Tara, always.
Yes, and what good is Tara?
She's had three husbands, and I'll be an old maid!
Great Jehoshaphat! Great Jehoshaphat!
Lordy, we sure is rich now.
That's ridiculous!
I'm entitled to at least see what my own child looks like.
You control yourself. You'll be seeing it for a long time.
I'd like to apologize about its not being a boy.
Oh, hush your mouth. Who wants a boy?
Boys aren't any use. Don't you think I'm proof of that?
Have a drink of sherry.
Mammy, she is beautiful, isn't she?
She sure is.
You ever see a prettier one?
Miss Scarlett was mighty near that pretty when she come, but not quite.
Have another glass.
Mammy? What's that rustling noise I hear?
Lordy, that ain't nothing but my red silk petticoat you done give me.
Nothing but your petticoat?
I don't believe it. Pull up your skirt.
Mr. Rhett, you is bad. Yea, Lordy!
You sure took a long enough time about wearing it.
Yes, sir. Too long.
No more mule in horse's harness?
Mister Rhett, Miss Scarlett was bad telling you about that. You ain't holding that against old Mammy, is you?
I don't hold it against you. I just wanted to know. Have another glass.
Here, take the whole bottle.
Dr. Meade says you can go in now, Captain Butler.
This sure is a happy day to me. I done diapered three generations of this family's girls.
And it sure is a happy day.
Oh, yes, Mammy. The happiest days are when babies come. I wish..
Oh, Mammy, she's beautiful. What do you suppose they'll name her?
Miss Scarlett done told me if it was a girl.. ..she was going to name it Eugenia Victoria.
Yes, she's a beautiful baby. The most beautiful baby ever.
Do you know that this is your birthday?
That you're a week old today?
Yes, I'm going to buy her a pony, the likes of which.. ..this town has never seen.
Yes, I'm going to send her to the best schools in Charleston.
Yes, and her will be received by the best families in the South.
And when it comes time for her to marry.. ..well, she'll be a little princess.
Certainly making a fool of yourself.
Why shouldn't I?
She's the first person who's ever completely belonged to me.
Great balls of fire!
I had the baby, didn't I?
It's Melanie. May I come in?
Come in.
Yes, come in and look at my daughter's beautiful blue eyes.
Most babies have blue eyes when they're born.
Don't tell him anything. He knows everything about babies.
Nevertheless, her eyes are blue and they'll stay blue.
As blue as the Bonnie Blue flag.
That's it. That's what we'll call her. "Bonnie Blue Butler."
Try again, Mammy.
Twenty inches.
Twenty inches. I've grown as big as Aunt Pitty. You simply gotta make it 181/2 again.
You done had a baby. And you ain't never gonna be no 181/2 inches again.
There ain't nothing to do about it.
There is something to do about it. I'm just not going to get old and fat before my time.
I just won't have any more babies.
I heard Mr. Rhett say that he'd be wanting a son next year.
Tell Captain Butler I decided not to go out. I'll have supper in my room.
I got your message. I'll have them bring my supper up here too.
No objections to that, I hope?
No. Yes. Uh..
Rhett..
Yes?
You see.. Well, I've decided..
Well, I hope I don't have any more children.
My pet, as I told you before Bonnie was born..
..it's immaterial to me whether you have one child or 20.
No, but you know what I.. Do you know what I mean?
I do. And do you know I can divorce you for this?
You're low enough to think of that.
If you had any chivalry in you, or were nice.. Look at Ashley Wilkes.
Melanie can't have any more children and he..
You've been to the lumber office this afternoon.
What has that got to do with it?
Quite the little gentleman, Ashley. Pray, go on, Mrs. Butler.
It's no use. You wouldn't understand.
You know, I'm sorry for you, Scarlett.
Sorry for me?
Yes, sorry for you because you throw away happiness with both hands..
..and reach out for something that'll never make you happy.
I don't know what you're talking about.
If you were free and Melly were dead and you had your precious Ashley..
You'd never know him, never even understand his mind..
..any more than you understand anything, except money.
Never mind about that. I want..
You may keep your sanctity. It'll work no hardship on me.
You don't care?
The world is full of many things and people.. ..and I shan't be lonely.
I will find comfort elsewhere.
Well, that's fine.
But I warn you, in case you change your mind, I intend to lock my door.
Why bother? If I wanted to come in, no lock could keep me out.
I knew most women were cheats.. ..hypocritical and hard, but this one..
It ain't no use. - What do you mean?
I mean you're poisoned with her.
I don't care what she's done to you. You're still in love with her.
It pleasures me none to say it.
Maybe so, but I'm through with her.
You've gotta think of the child. Child's worth 10 of the mother.
You're a shrewd woman, Belle. And a very nice one.
Yes, Rhett?
I was just thinking of the difference between you and..
You're both hardheaded businesswomen, and successful. But you've got a heart, Belle.
And you're honest.
Goodbye, Rhett. Goodbye, Belle.
She'll be a wonderful horsewoman. Look at those hands. And that seat!
Oh, fiddle-dee-dee! Why we have to wheel a baby when we have servants..
Good morning, Mrs. Merriwether.
Captain Butler.
Good morning, Scarlett.
Making fools of ourselves in front of these buffaloes.
If you'd thought of your position, you wouldn't have to.
But as it is, we're going to cultivate every female dragon of the Old Guard..
Good morning, Mrs. Whiting.
Captain Butler.
Good morning, Scarlett.
So the millionaire speculator is turning respectable.
Money can't buy what I want for Bonnie. I'll admit I've been at fault too.
Bonnie will have a place among decent people.
Even if we both have to crawl on our bellies to every fat old cat..
Good morning, Mrs. Meade.
Good morning, Captain Butler.
Good morning, Scarlett.
Mrs. Merriwether, I have great regard for your knowledge. - Could you give me some advice?
Why, certainly.
My Bonnie sucks her thumb. I can't stop her.
You should make her stop! It'll ruin the shape of her mouth.
I know, I know. She has such a beautiful mouth too. - I tried putting soap on her nails.
Soap? Bah! Put quinine on her thumb and she'll stop sucking it quick enough.
Quinine! I never would have thought of it. I can't thank you enough.
You've taken a great load off my mind. Good morning.
Good morning, Dolly.
Wasn't that Captain Butler?
Good morning, Caroline. I was just thinking..
..there's a great deal of good in a man who would love a child so much.
But of course there is.
Fanny Elsing told Dr. Meade that Captain Butler finally admitted..
..that he was honored for his services at the Battle of Franklin.
No, and did I tell you that Captain Butler made..
..a stupendous contribution to the Association for the Beautification.. - ..of the Graves of the Glorious Dead?
No!
My grandbaby, Napoleon Picard, is giving a party for Bonnie next week.
Why, Dolly Merriwether, it was my idea to give a party for Bonnie.
Why, Caroline Meade, how can you say a thing like that?
Watch Daddy put your pony over it, Bonnie. Now, watch!
Daddy, let me! Let me!
All right, darling. Put her on, Pork.
Up we go! Oh, there!
Lordy mercy! There he goes again.
Grip tightly with your legs. Lean forward and go with him.
Hold your reins properly in a firm hand.
That was fine. I knew you'd do it.
When you're older, I'll take you to Kentucky and Virginia.
You'll be the best horsewoman in the South. Give your daddy a kiss.
Mr. Rhett? Mr. Rhett!
Mr. Rhett!
Did you see her?
Wasn't she wonderful?
Mr. Rhett, I done told you and told you.. ..it just ain't fitting' for a girl to ride astraddle with her dress flying up.
All right. I'll teach her to ride sidesaddle.
And I'll buy her a blue velvet riding habit. She'll love that.
A nice black broadcloth is what little girls wear.
Oh, now, Mammy, be reasonable.
Well, I don't think it's fitting', but..
It ain't fitting', it just ain't fitting'.
It ain't fitting'.
Why, Scarlett, what are you doing downtown at this time of day?
Well, Ashley, I just..
Why aren't you helping Melly with my surprise birthday party?
Why, Ashley Wilkes, you aren't supposed to know anything about that.
Melly'd be so disappointed if you weren't surprised.
I won't let on.
I'll be the most surprised man in Atlanta.
As long as you're here, let me show you the books..
..so you can see how bad a businessman I am.
Don't let's fool with any books today.
When I'm wearing a new bonnet.. ..all the figures I ever knew go right out of my head.
Figures are well lost when the bonnet's as pretty as that.
Scarlett, you know, you get prettier all the time.
You haven't changed a bit since our last barbecue at Twelve Oaks.. ..where you sat under a tree surrounded by dozens of beaus.
That girl doesn't exist anymore.
Nothing's turned out as I expected, Ashley. Nothing.
Yes, we've traveled a long road since the old days, haven't we?
Oh, the lazy days.. ..the warm, still, country twilight..
..the high, soft Negro laughter from the quarters..
..the golden warmth and security of those days.
Don't look back, Ashley. Don't look back.
It drags at your heart till..
..you can't do anything but look back.
I didn't mean to make you sad, my dear.
I never want you to be anything but completely happy.
Oh, Ashley!
Who is it?
Only your husband.
Come in.
Am I actually being invited into the sanctuary?
You're not ready for Melanie's party.
I've got a headache, Rhett. You go without me and make my excuses to Melanie.
What a white-livered little coward you are!
You're going to that party and you'll have to hurry.
Has India dared..? - Yes, India has.
Everyone in town knows the story.
Kill them for spreading lies.
I don't kill people who tell the truth.
No time to argue. I won't go!
I can't go until this misunderstanding clears up.
You won't cheat Melly out of publicly ordering you out of her house.
There was nothing wrong. India hates me so.
I can't go.
If you don't show your face tonight, you'll never be able to again.
I don't care, but you won't ruin Bonnie's chances.
You're going to that party, for her sake. Get dressed.
Wear that. Nothing modest or matronly will do for this occasion.
And put on plenty of rouge. I want you to look your part tonight.
For he's a jolly good fellow For he's a jolly good fellow For he's a jolly good fellow
Which nobody can deny Which nobody can deny Which nobody can deny
Good night, Scarlett.
But, Rhett..
You're going into the arena alone. The lions are hungry.
Don't leave me. Don't.
You're not afraid?
What a lovely dress, darling.
India wasn't able to come. Will you be an angel?
I do need you to help me receive my guests.
Mrs. Meade.. ..here's our darling Scarlett.
Good evening.
Good evening.
Ashley, aren't you going to get our Scarlett a glass of punch?
Did you have a good time at Miss Melly's party? Yes.
Now, Mammy, be sure and leave word. If Captain Butler asks for me when he comes back, I'm asleep.
Yes'm.
Come in, Mrs. Butler.
Come here.
Sit down.
No reason you shouldn't have a nightcap, even if I am here.
I didn't want a drink. I heard a noise..
You heard nothing of the kind.
You wouldn't have come if you thought I was here.
You must need a drink badly. - I do not.
Take it.
Don't give yourself airs.
I know you drink on the quiet, and I know how much you drink.
Do you think I care if you like your brandy?
You're drunk and I'm going to bed.
I'm very drunk.. ..and I intend getting still drunker before the evening's over.
But you're not going to bed. Not yet.
Sit down.
So she stood by you, did she?
How's it feel to have the woman you've wronged cloak your sins?
You're wondering if she knows all about you and Ashley.
You're wondering if she did it just to save face.
You're thinking she's a fool for doing it, even if it saved your hide..
I will not listen.
Yes, you'll listen.
Miss Melly's a fool, but not the kind you think.
She has too much honor to conceive of dishonor in anyone she loves.
And she loves you. Though just why she does, I'm sure I don't know.
If you weren't so drunk and insulting, I could explain everything.
As it is, though..
You get out of that chair once more..
Of course, the comic figure in all this is the long-suffering Mr. Wilkes.
Mr. Wilkes, who can't be mentally faithful to his wife.. ..and won't be unfaithful to her technically.
Why doesn't he make up his mind?
Rhett, you..
Observe my hands, my dear.
I could tear you to pieces with them.
And I'd do it if it'd take Ashley out of your mind forever.
But it wouldn't.
So I'll remove him from your mind forever, this way.
I'll put my hands so. One on each side of your head.
And I'll smash your skull between them like a walnut.
And that'll block him out.
Take your hands off me, you drunken fool!
You know, I've always admired your spirit, my dear.
Never more than now, when you're cornered.
I'm not cornered. You'll never corner me or frighten me.
You've lived in dirt so long, you can't understand anything else.
You're jealous of something you can't understand. Good night.
Jealous, am I?
Yes, I suppose I am.
Even though I know you've been faithful to me all along.
How do I know?
Because I know Ashley Wilkes and his honorable breed. They're gentlemen.
That's more than I can say for you or for me. We're not gentlemen.
And we have no honor, have we?
It's not that easy, Scarlett.
You turn me out while you chase Ashley, while you dream of Ashley.
This is one night you're not turning me out.
How are you feeling this morning?
Well, this misery in my back.. ..ain't so good.
You act mighty happy this morning.
I am, Mammy. I am.
Oh, she wept with delight When he gave her a smile
And trembled with fear at his frown
Hello.
I, um.. I'd like to extend my apology for my conduct of last night.
Oh, but, Rhett.
I was very drunk.. ..and quite swept off my feet by your charms.
You needn't bother to apologize. Nothing you do surprises me.
I've been thinking, and I believe it would be better for both of us..
..if we admitted we made a mistake and got a divorce.
A divorce? - Yes.
There's no point in holding on to each other.
I'll provide for you. You've plenty of grounds. Just give me Bonnie, and you can say what you please.
Thank you, but I wouldn't dream of disgracing the family with a divorce.
You'd disgrace it if Ashley were free.
Makes my head spin to think how quickly you'd divorce me.
Wouldn't you?
Answer me. Wouldn't you?
Please go now and leave me alone.
I'm going. That's what I came to tell you.
I'm going on a very extended trip to London. - And I'm leaving today.
I'm taking Bonnie with me. Please get her duds packed right away.
You'll never take my child out of this house.
She's my child too.
You're mistaken if you think I'm leaving her here..
..with a mother who doesn't consider her reputation.
You're a fine one to talk.
You think I'll let her out when you'll have her around people like Belle?
If you were a man, I'd break your neck for that.
I'll thank you to shut your mouth.
As for you giving yourself airs about motherhood.. ..a cat's a better mother than you are.
Have her things packed for me in an hour, or I warn you..
..I've always thought a lashing with a whip would benefit you immensely.
Excuse me, Mr. Rhett.
Hello, Uncle Rhett.
Hello, Beau.
Daddy, where have you been?
I've been waiting for you all morning.
I've been hunting for a rabbit skin to wrap my little Bonnie in.
Give your best sweetheart a kiss.
Bonnie, I'm going to take you on a long trip to fairyland.
Where? Where?
I'll show you the Tower of London, where the little princes were.. ..and London Bridge.
London Bridge?
Will it be falling down?
Well, it will if you want it to, darling.
Daddy, dark!
Dark!
Bonnie!
Bonnie!
It's all right, Bonnie.
Who put out that light? Nurse!
Daddy, dark!
Yes, yes, yes..
What's the matter with my Bonnie? A bear!
Oh, a bear?
A big bear?
Dreadful big! And he sat on my chest!
I'll stay here and shoot him if he comes back.
Oh, good evening, Mr. Butler.
I told you never to leave this child alone in the dark.
Children are often afraid of the dark, but they get over it.
Let her scream for a night..
Let her scream?
Either you're a fool or an inhuman woman.
If you want her to grow up cowardly..
Cowardly? There isn't a cowardly bone in her body.
You're discharged.
As you say, sir.
Where's Mother?
Bonnie.. Aren't you happy here in London with me?
I wanna go home.
Miss Bonnie! And Captain Butler!
Miss Scarlett!
Hello, Mammy!
Honey child!
Miss Scarlett, they's back.
Bonnie! Bonnie, baby.
Darling baby!
You glad to be home?
Daddy gave me a kitten.
But London's a horrid place.
Where's my pony? I wanna go out and see my pony.
You go out and see your pony.
Where's my pony?
I want to go out and see my pony.
You run along with Mammy.
Come on, honey child. Mammy sure missed you, honey.
Mrs. Butler, I believe.
Mammy said you'd come back.
Only to bring Bonnie.
Apparently any mother, even a bad one, is better than none.
You mean you're going away again?
What perception, Mrs. Butler. Right away.
In fact, I left my bags at the station.
You're looking pale. Is there a shortage of rouge?
Or can this wanness mean you've been missing me?
If I'm pale, it's your fault. Not because I've been missing you, but because..
Pray continue, Mrs. Butler.
It's because I'm going to have a baby.
Indeed.
And who's the happy father?
You know it's yours. I don't want it any more than you do.
No woman would want the child of a cad like you.
I wish it were anybody's child but yours!
Well, cheer up. Maybe you'll have an accident.
Is she better?
Has she asked for me?
Don't you understand? She's delirious.
Rhett..
I want Rhett!
What's the matter, honey?
Did you call somebody, child?
It's no use. It's no use!
Dr. Meade's left.
Scarlett's dead.
Oh, no, she's much better. Really she is.
There, there, Captain Butler, you're beside yourself.
She'll very soon be well again.
I promise you. She never wanted this baby.
Not want a baby? Why, every woman wants a baby.
You do, but she doesn't. Not my children.
She told me she didn't want any more.
I wanted to hurt her because she'd hurt me. And I did.
You mustn't tell me these things. It's not fair to..
I didn't know about this baby until she fell.
If I'd only known, I'd have come straight home.
Well, of course you would.
And then when she told me there on the steps, what did I do? What did I say?
I laughed and I said.. But you didn't mean it.
I know you didn't mean it.
But I did mean it. I was crazy with jealousy.
She's never cared for me. I tried to make her care, but I couldn't.
You're so wrong. Scarlett loves you a great deal.
Much more than she knows.
If that were true, I'd wait forever. If she'd only forgive me.
She will. You must be patient.
No, it's not possible. If you only knew who she really loved..
You wouldn't believe it.
Surely you haven't listened to idle gossip.
No, Captain Butler. I wouldn't believe it.
There, there. Scarlett's going to get well, and there can be other babies.
She couldn't even if she wanted to.
But of course she could! I'm going to.
No, Miss Melly, you mustn't risk it. It's too dangerous.
Children are life renewing itself, Captain Butler.
And when life does that, danger seems very unimportant.
I've never before known anyone who was really brave.
I pray God things go well with you, Miss Melly.
And I want to thank you for all you've done for me and for Scarlett.
From my heart, I thank you.
Miss Scarlett's feeling a heap better today, Mr. Rhett.
I've come to ask your forgiveness.. ..hoping our life together has another chance.
Our life together?
When did we ever have a life together?
Yes, you're right. But I'm sure if we could only try again, we could be happy.
What is there to make us happy now?
Well, there's Bonnie.. ..and I love you, Scarlett.
When did you discover that?
I've always loved you, but you've never given me a chance to show it.
And just what do you want me to do?
To begin with, give up the mill, Scarlett.
We'll go away. We'll take Bonnie and have another honeymoon.
Give up the mill?
It's making more money than ever.
I know, but we don't need it. Sell it.
Or give it to Ashley. Melanie's been such a friend to us. Melanie!
If you'd only think more about me!
I am thinking of you.
And I'm thinking that, well.. ..maybe the mill's taking you away from me and Bonnie.
I know what you're thinking. Don't bring Bonnie into it.
You're taking her away from me.
But she loves you.
You've made her love you and not me. She's so spoiled now, that..
Mommy, Daddy!
Watch me.
We're watching, darling.
You're mighty pretty, precious.
So are you.
I'm going to jump. Watch me, Daddy.
I don't think you ought to do much jumping yet. You just learned to ride sidesaddle.
I will so jump. I can jump better than ever, because I've grown. I moved the bar higher.
Don't let her do it, Rhett.
No, Bonnie, you can't. If you fall off, don't cry and blame me!
Rhett, stop her.
Bonnie!
Bonnie!
She's just like Pa.
Just like Pa..!
Bonnie! Bonnie!
Bonnie!
Bonnie!
Lordy, Miss Melly. I sure is glad you's come.
Oh, Mammy, this house won't seem the same without Bonnie.
How's Miss Scarlett bearing up?
Miss Melly, this here's done broke her heart. I didn't fetch you on Miss Scarlett's account.
What that child got to stand, the good Lord give her strength to stand.
It's Mr. Rhett I's worried about.
He done lost his mind these last couple of days.
Oh, no, Mammy, no.
I ain't never seen no man, black or white, set such store on any child.
When Dr. Meade say her neck broke.. ..Mr. Rhett grabbed his gun and run out and shoot that poor pony.
And for a minute, I think he gonna shoot hisself.
Oh, poor Captain Butler.
Miss Scarlett called him a murderer for teaching that child to jump.
She said, "You give me my baby what you killed." And then he say Miss Scarlett ain't never cared nothing about Miss Bonnie.
It like to turn my blood cold, the things they say to one another.
Stop, Mammy, don't tell me any more.
And then that night.. ..Mr. Rhett, he locked hisself in the nursery with Miss Bonnie.
He wouldn't open the door when Miss Scarlett beat on it and hollered.
And that's where he's been for two whole days.
Oh, Mammy!
This evening, Miss Scarlett shouted through the door and said: "The funeral's set for tomorrow."
He says, "You try that, and I kills you tomorrow."
Do you think I's gonna put my child in the dark when she's so scared of it?"
Oh, Mammy, Mammy! - He has lost his mind!
Yes'm, that's the God's truth. He ain't gonna let us bury that child. You gotta help us.
Oh, but I can't intrude.
If you can't help us, who can?
Mr. Rhett always set great store by your opinion.
Please, Miss Melly.
I'll do what I can, Mammy.
Get away from that door and leave us alone.
It's Mrs. Wilkes, Captain Butler. Please let me in.
I've come to see Bonnie.
Oh, Lord, please help Mr. Rhett in this hour of his grief.
I want you to make a good deal of strong coffee.. ..and bring it up to Captain Butler.
I'll go and see Miss Scarlett. But..
Captain Butler's willing for the funeral to take place tomorrow morning.
Hallelujah!
I expect the angels fights on your side, Miss Melly.
Miss Melly!
Miss Melly!
Miss Melly! Miss Melly. Miss Melly.
Send for Dr. Meade, Mammy. And try.. Try to get me home.
Miss Melly! Miss Melly!
Where is my mother going away to? And why can't I go along, please?
We can't always go along, Beau, as much as we may want to.
You're going back to bed now.
Oh, Rhett, she can't be dying. She can't be.
She hasn't your strength. She's never had any. - She's never had anything but heart.
You knew that too?
Why do I have to go back to bed? It's morning.
It isn't really morning yet.
You may come in now, Scarlett.
Dr. Meade, please let me see her.
I've been waiting here two days. I've got to tell her that I was wrong about something.
She knows you were wrong. She wants to see Scarlett.
Miss Melly's going to die in peace.
Don't ease your conscience.. ..telling her things that make no difference now. You understand?
It's me, Melly.
Promise me?
Anything.
Look after my little son.
I gave him to you once before. Remember?
The day he was born.
Please, Melly, don't talk this way. I know you'll get well.
Promise me.. college.
Yes, and Europe, and a pony. Whatever he wants, but.. ..oh, Melly, do try.
Ashley..
Ashley and you..
What about Ashley, Melly?
Look after him for me..
..just as you looked after me.. ..for him.
I will, Melly.
Look after him.. ..but never let him know.
Good night.
Promise?
What else, Melly?
Captain Butler. - Be kind to him.
Rhett?
He loves you so.
Yes, Melly.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
You ladies may come in now.
Ashley!
I don't know where the mate to this is.
She must've put it away.
Stop it! Hold me. I'm so frightened!
Scarlett, what can I do? I can't live without her.
Everything I ever had is going with her.
Oh, Ashley..
You really love her, don't you?
She's the only dream I ever had that didn't die in the face of reality.
Dreams. Always dreams with you. Never common sense.
Scarlett, if you knew what I've gone through!
Ashley, you should've told me years ago that you loved her and not me.
And not left me dangling with your talk of honor.
But you had to wait till now, now when Melly's dying..
..to show me that I could never mean any more to you.. ..than this Watling woman does to Rhett.
And I've loved something that doesn't really exist.
But somehow.. ..I don't care.
Somehow, it doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter one bit.
Oh, Ashley.. Ashley, forgive me. Don't cry.
She mustn't see you've been crying.
Ashley!
Melly!
Rhett! Rhett!
Rhett, where are you?
Rhett, wait for me!
Rhett, wait for me!
Rhett!
Rhett!
Rhett!
Rhett!
Rhett!
Come in.
Rhett..
Melanie, she's..?
Well, God rest her.
She was the only completely kind person I ever knew.
A great lady. A very great lady.
So she's dead. That makes it nice for you, doesn't it?
How can you say such a thing?
You know how I loved her, really.
No, I don't know that I do. It's to your credit that you could appreciate her.
Of course I appreciated her. She thought of everybody except herself.
Why, her last words were about you.
What did she say?
She said, "Be kind to Captain Butler.." "..he loves you so."
Did she say anything else?
She said.. She asked me to look after Ashley too.
It's convenient to have the first wife's permission, isn't it?
What do you mean?
What are you doing?
I'm leaving you, my dear.
All you need now is a divorce, and your dreams of Ashley can come true.
Oh, no! No, you're wrong. Terribly wrong.
I don't want a divorce. Oh, Rhett, when I knew tonight, when I knew I loved you..
..I ran home to tell you. Oh, darling, darling!
Please don't go on with this. Leave us some dignity out of our marriage.
Spare us this last. This last?
Do listen to me!
I must have loved you for years, only..
..I was such a fool, I didn't know it. Please believe me.
You must care.
Melly said you did.
I believe you. And what about Ashley Wilkes?
I never really loved Ashley.
You certainly gave a good imitation of it, up to this morning.
No, Scarlett. I've tried everything.
If you'd met me halfway, even when I came back from London.
I was so glad to see you. I was, Rhett, but you were so nasty.
Then when you were sick, and it was all my fault.
I hoped that you'd call for me. But you didn't.
I wanted you.
I wanted you desperately.. ..but I didn't think you wanted me.
It seems we've been at cross purposes, doesn't it?
But it's no use now.
As long as there was Bonnie, there was a chance we might be happy.
I liked to think that Bonnie was you, a little girl again.
Before the war and poverty had done things to you. She was so like you.
And I could pet her and spoil her, as I wanted to spoil you.
But when she went, she took everything.
Rhett, please don't say that. I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry for everything.
My darling, you're such a child.
You think that by saying, "I'm sorry," all the past can be corrected.
Here, take my handkerchief.
Never, in any crisis of your life, have I known you to have a handkerchief.
Rhett! Rhett, where are you going?
I'm going to Charleston, back where I belong.
Please. Please take me with you.
I'm through with everything here.
I want peace. I want to see if somewhere..
..there isn't something left in life of charm and grace.
You know what I'm talking about?
No!
I only know that I love you!
That's your misfortune.
Oh, Rhett!
Rhett!
Rhett! If you go, where shall I go? What shall I do?
Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn.
I can't let him go. I can't!
There must be some way to bring him back.
Oh, I can't think about this now. I'll go crazy if I do.
I'll think about it tomorrow.
But I must think about it! I must think about it.
What is there to do?
What is there that matters?
You mean to tell me, Scarlett, Tara doesn't mean anything?
Land's the only thing that matters. It's the only thing that lasts.
Something you love more than me, though you may not know it. Tara.
It's this from which you get your strength, the red earth of Tara.
Land's the only thing that matters. The only thing that lasts.
Something you love more than me, though you may not know it.
..from which you get your strength. Tara.
Land's the only thing that matters.
Something you love more.
..the red earth of Tara.
Tara!
Tara!
Tara!
Tara!
Home.
I'll go home.
And I'll think of some way to get him back.
After all, tomorrow is another day!
A MAN HAS KILLED ANOTHER. NOW, BARRICADED IN HIS ROOM,
HE RECALLS THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT LED HIM TO MURDER.
You want details?
Shut your filthy trap!
Look where it all got you.
What about you?
What's that? Did someone fall?
Did someone –
Someone fell!
Is anyone there?
I don't know!
A blind man got killed.
No, it was suicide. Poor guy. It's not easy being blind.
Someone fell.
Why did he shoot?
And who's the dead man?
I've never seen him before.
We just found him on the stairs.
Shall we go up?
Police.
Leave me the hell alone. Police!
If you don't open up right now – No, I won't open up!
I don't wanna see you.
Leave me alone. Just leave me alone.
I never want to see anyone ever again.
Open up or –
Beat it or I'll shoot!
What the heck's going on, François?
What kind of man is this François?
An alcoholic? An alcoholic?
There's no finer man in the building.
No offense, Mr. Gerbois.
None taken. François is a good fellow.
I told you that Gerbois was a bad sort.
Back inside.
Everyone out of the hallway.
Where are you going, ma'am?
I can't stay in this hotbed of crime.
You're in no danger.
That's what you say.
Oh, my spoons!
Don't get in the way, ma'am.
My spoons! - To hell with your spoons!
Come with me.
Yes, your spoons.
I know.
How would they understand?
Talking to yourself now? You're in sad shape.
To celebrate my name day? You mean your name is François?
Did you figure that out all by yourself?
It wasn't hard. My name is Françoise.
No kidding. Then we're both celebrating today.
So who are they for?
Not us.
I'm supposed to deliver them, but I got lost. Delivering them to whom?
A customer of ours. Madame Legardier.
You really did get lost.
She's the assistant manager's wife. You won't find her around here.
I'll show you where to find her.
See that hangar?
Turn left just past that.
Keep going and you'll see a pretty house with a garden.
You'll put down roots!
You look cute holding those. Like a little tree.
Did our work catch your eye? Nice job, huh?
Well, a job is freedom.
You couldn't dream of a healthier life. We drink milk all day long.
Want some? No, thanks.
I don't much care for milk.
Me neither, but you gotta drink it.
I drink milk too.
He'll drink milk when cows eat grapes.
To your health.
You work around here?
Where?
For the Briquets.
The Briquets?
The florists.
Are they your parents?
I have no parents. I was an orphan.
Incredible. I was an orphan too.
That's funny!
Both named after St. Francis, and neither has any family.
And today happens to be our name day.
I told you: This is one healthy place.
Your breath's so fresh.
Come out for a stroll?
Not tonight.
Why not? Come in, but don't make noise.
Everyone's asleep. I can come in?
You won't bite?
I'm not that wild.
What do you think about when you kiss me?
You know very well, so why ask?
François, we haven't known each other long enough.
What do you mean? It's been three weeks. That's 21 days.
That's almost a month, and a month's a long time. Especially when I like you so much.
We should get married and throw a party.
Married? You can be so silly sometimes.
We'd have kids.
A whole slew of kids – and send 'em all to an orphanage.
I'm just kidding. I really am crazy about you.
It's funny, the two of us here, and everyone else asleep.
As if the whole world had died.
You know, that wouldn't be so bad – you and me the only two left alive.
That would be nice... maybe.
They say lovers are more alive than other people.
You think that's true?
No idea.
You shouldn't smoke. It makes you cough.
It's the sand at the factory.
All done.
Pretty, isn't it?
I'm going to attach it to my dress.
Your manners are a bit rusty.
You don't leave guests waiting in the kitchen.
And I don't like being left alone.
I'm coming in, ready or not.
You making yourself pretty for me? You've got a nice place.
The bed... is kinda narrow.
That's a picture of me.
Several, in fact. Nice to see you've got me stuck there.
A familiar face in a strange house makes you feel more at home.
Who's this?
That's Bolop.
I've had him since I was a kid.
He looks like you.
There is a resemblance.
One eye is happy while the other is a bit sad.
You're right.
One of my eyes is happy, the other sad.
How'd you notice that?
Funny.
You collect postcards?
Monte Carlo. Villefranche-sur-Mer.
Nice.
The English Promenade" in Nice. I've heard it's really swell there.
For ten francs you can sit and watch the English walk by.
Why do you laugh? The Riviera is beautiful. You been there?
There are huge red rocks, and the ocean, and casinos all along the shore.
Casinos. There's always sunshine and flowers, even in winter.
Mimosas. Casinos and mimosas. You make me laugh.
That's all just a pipe dream. Maybe so. But some days are so sad here.
That's because you live alone.
If you lived with me, you'd see.
You're sweet. Of course I am. Are you kidding?
When I get a few francs I'll buy you a bike, and when the weather's nice at Easter, we'll go pick lilacs, okay?
It's nothing.
Listen.
How about I spend the night?
I'll leave early in the morning. No one will see me.
Not tonight. - Why? Don't you like me?
Yes, but I promised to meet someone.
At this hour?
They let you go out this late?
Everyone's asleep.
It's just me looking after the house anyway.
So much for looking after it. - You're not jealous, are you?
Of course not.
I'm free. We're both free.
Well, then... good night.
Let me know when you feel like seeing me again.
Very funny.
Serves you right.
Waltz for us.
I swear... women are fools, and I'm the queen of the bunch.
Three years with a guy like that – you gotta have bats in your belfry.
Are you done airing your dirty laundry?
My dirty laundry?
You walk up and unload the whole story.
What am I supposed to do about it? Don't be mad. I was just thinking out loud.
I'm so happy tonight.
You can't imagine.
You couldn't know, of course, but that man has a silver tongue.
And the way he moves his hands when he talks.
The words just trip off his tongue.
He can tell you anything and you believe it.
What's wrong?
You could say something nice.
Something tender. You want me to say you're pretty?
I can't tell under all that makeup.
I always take it off before I go to bed.
A woman who's suddenly regained her freedom doesn't often run into a man she likes.
Are your eyes blue?
It's very soothing.
What are you doing?
You gonna just walk away?
Listen...
I can't see you home.
I have to see someone.
Listen, Clara,
I love a good joke, but not at my expense.
Walking off the job like that!
The job?
You make me laugh.
There's no more job.
No more dogs, no more trips.
I'm getting off your bicycle built for two.
We're leaving tomorrow. Easy there. The lady's with me.
For the moment. - Not at all. We're gonna stay together forever, right?
Ship schedules.
It's all so sad, Mr. Gerbois.
He greeted me so nicely on his way in earlier.
He even pet the cat.
The cat.
I wonder what he's doing now all alone up there.
It can't be pleasant. - No, I'm sure it's not.
And with this cold spell.
Where am I gonna sleep?
I can't afford a hotel.
He's pushed an armoire against the door!
That's all we needed.
What? I said is there an armoire in that room?
Of course there is.
Is it large?
Just a regular armoire.
You alone?
Come on, it's Sunday.
The Department of Tears is closed.
I'm in the mood for love.
For a brute like you.
I'm a nice brute, aren't I?
Sure, you're a nice brute... who drops in when he feels like it, now and then, like a tourist seeing the sights.
At least I don't bring a lot of baggage.
My point exactly.
You should have brought your things over here. You've known all along that wasn't our deal.
I know.
You made no promises.
I made no demands.
But still – - Still what?
I get bored at night.
Don't you sleep? - Yes.
Well, then?
I have nightmares.
I dream you're not there.
I wake up with a start... to find you're really not there, which doesn't help matters.
If that's what you call a night of love –
A night of love. You're crazy.
That stuff's for books, or for guys with nothing to do, and even then, who knows?
When you bust your back all day, the night's for getting some sleep.
Whereas daytime... that's another matter.
Sunday mornings, for instance.
Isn't it a little bright in here? The winter sun is gentle.
I prefer a bit of shadow.
Would you look at that!
What is it? - Come look.
What's he up to? No good, I'm sure.
I'm sure he's come to see you. Me?
He's here about the girl. I told you not to bring her up again.
He's taking forever.
What's he doing?
Now there's a pretty sight.
That's right.
I listen through keyholes.
I'm not a slave to petty conventions.
Strange how people who seem so upright are the very ones terrified someone might be listening.
Yes, I've always been very intelligent.
Is that my fault?
I hope I'm not disturbing you terribly.
You seem so happy together.
Oh, I'm not jealous. I'm a nomad.
Here one day, gone the next. It's all the same to me.
And it warms my heart to see this budding happiness.
What are you doing here? I don't know.
I was just passing by.
It's funny.
I'm like a ghost from the past.
Want to see the dogs?
How quickly women forget.
Poor little creatures.
Not women. I meant the dogs.
Enough about the dogs. Or did you think we'd jump through hoops too?
For a smart guy, you sure don't get to the point. What do you want? - He wants to talk to you!
And you want to talk to him too. Leave and he'll follow you.
It'll be easier on both of you. And me too.
I don't want to hear what either of you has to say.
You know, Clara, I was really hurt when you left.
Is that right? You're getting old.
That's right.
You coming? - All right, all right.
Go on in.
Here? - Yeah.
For example, you're still seeing the girl.
Fine, be rude.
That's what I said.
I've put up with your little affair with Clara.
I could have fought it. I had my ways. But I let it go...
because I'm broad-minded.
Too bad your head's too small for your broad mind.
You can't keep things straight. First it's Françoise, now it's Clara.
You're all mixed up.
You're tired.
Listen, Clara's free to do as she wishes.
There's something you should know.
What's that?
If I've shown an interest in that girl... it's because she's... my daughter.
Strange as it may seem, it's a fact.
Françoise is my daughter.
Cognac with water and a white Bordeaux.
She's an orphan. You think orphans don't have parents?
I'll be honest with you.
I'm just a pitiful man... and like every man, I have my faults.
But deep down I'm no worse than any other man.
I admit that.
And there's no point blaming her mother.
We had that child when I was young.
I didn't know what I was doing. "A youthful indiscretion."
A lark.
But you get older... and you realize it wasn't a lark... but a terrible mistake.
And that eats at you.
Idiotic as it may sound, it's called "remorse."
I could think of nothing else. I searched everywhere. You can't imagine how I searched.
I checked and rechecked all the facts.
And when I saw her... she was the spitting image of her mother.
Her mother was a real beauty, my friend.
Those same eyes, gray one moment, green the next.
That's some story.
Yes... it's some story.
It's a small world, my friend.
Fate leads you down separate paths, but the world turns and you meet again.
So you see, it's my duty to get involved. Your duty!
It's completely understandable.
And frankly...
I don't think she can be happy with you.
There's no other word. Her father.
Her father's a real piece of work.
Puts his daughter in storage, then tiptoes back 20 years later, tears in his eyes.
And for what? To lecture me.
That's really rich.
Listen here. I have one thing to say.
I was raised in an orphanage too, and if my folks showed up now to play patty-cake, I'd let 'em have it.
And why the hell should I care anyway? I love Françoise.
You hear me? And there's nothing you can do about it.
You love her?
Does she love you?
Think about it, my friend.
I have a right to know where you two stand. A right?
You're getting on my nerves.
What are your intentions?
Stop and think a minute.
Surely you don't mean to –
I'm responsible for her.
You don't have a good job. You have no future. Your work's killing you.
Admit it:
Your job's a health hazard! What's that?
What did you say? You're lucky you're her father.
Listen to me.
You're gonna get up and walk out of here quietly.
Make yourself real scarce.
You got that?
We'd be happy together.
But you know... there is something bothering me.
Or someone, I should say.
Don't act surprised. You know who I mean. That again?
You still jealous?
No, it's not jealousy, now that I know who he is, but you could have told me.
That he's your father.
He's not my father. - He's not? - No.
He has this little habit of telling stories.
Well, that's some story.
What about everything he told me?
The guy's crazy. What's he after?
And why do you keep seeing him?
I already told you.
He's always been very kind to me.
He's the only one who was ever kind to me before you came along.
Ah, right. The postcards.
He's traveled a lot and knows so many things.
He's never traveled. He doesn't know a thing.
He's a lunatic, a liar.
I can't stand him. Going on and on about "my little girl."
I tell you, guys like that –
If you'd like, I'll never see him again.
You mean it?
Then I promise never to see Clara again.
But how can you stand a guy who lies like that? Everyone lies. I've lied a time or two.
If I said otherwise, I'd be lying.
I don't like liars. Oh, I'm not a real liar.
Of course not. That's why I love you.
It's nice here.
Remember what you said?
I love you, you know.
You have a beautiful body, and you're fragile like a small animal.
That first time I saw you holding those flowers, I suddenly wanted to be happy.
Sometimes when I'm alone, I think about love too.
I'm happy and I feel like laughing.
Now I hear your words, and it feels nice. My heart gets all tight, and I feel like crying.
I don't understand complicated things.
I don't like to suffer.
You think I do?
We'll be happy together. You'll see.
I was never really happy before, but I was alone and it didn't matter.
I had nothing but problems, big and small.
I took the train one day wearing my new cap, and bam – out the window.
And all the rest of it.
Work, no work.
Is there a job I haven't done? All different, all the same.
Spray painting, lead painting. Lead painting's no good, just like the sand gun.
When I couldn't fight it anymore, I just gave in. Things went from bad to worse, but I got used to it.
You know, like waiting for a streetcar in the rain. You try to get on. Ding!
It's full. Second car, third car – ding, ding!
You're left standing in the rain like a sucker.
Anyway... But now we're together.
Everything's gonna change. Will you keep me all to yourself?
Of course.
Do you love me?
Here.
There's nothing to say, nothing to explain.
I knew the moment you walked in looking like your pet canary just died.
Good thing we weren't in love. Imagine parting if you were in love. That would be awful.
You mad at me?
What for? I've been very happy.
Sure, I wish it could have lasted, but I lived here while you lived across the street.
We were too far apart. Don't make that face.
I'm not making a face. Yes, you are.
You'd think I was the one dumping you.
You're too delicate, too sensitive.
Men!
What are you gonna do now?
I'll find another gig. I know people in the business.
But he was a real terror with the seals. So I left him for Valentin.
He was a smooth one, Valentin.
He could train a dog in three days. You know how?
He'd shave a spot on its paw and burn the skin there with a red-hot iron.
To make him perform, he'd crack the whip on that spot.
Enough about that creep. He's crazy.
No, he's not crazy.
He's just rotten, like a piece of old fruit.
And he knows it.
So he takes it out on others... like he took it out on me. Anyway, no use complaining.
You were a breath of fresh air.
A little rest cure. Listen, Clara, I never meant to hurt you.
I hope you'll have fond memories of me, because I'll never forget you.
I'd forget you in a heartbeat if I could.
You and your memories.
Think I can make love to memories?
I'll give you a little memory of my own.
A present to remind you of me.
Here. - Where'd you get this?
From Valentin. Surprised?
I took 'em just so he'd have to buy more.
Step right up, ladies and gentlemen!
They're pretty.
Look here.
Pretty as can be.
He gives one to each of his conquests.
Your little friend has one too, doesn't she?
I'm not some freak! What are you waiting for?
Ah, you think I'm gonna jump!
A killer!
Now there's something to gossip about!
Sure, I'm a killer, but killers are a dime a dozen!
They're everywhere!
Everyone kills!
They just do it quietly, so you don't see. It's like sand – it gets deep inside you!
Beat it, all of you!
Go home and read your newspapers!
They'll print the whole thing!
And you'll believe it, 'cause the papers know their stuff!
Now beat it before you catch cold!
Leave me alone, you hear me?
I'm not asking for anything! Now leave me alone!
He's shouting!
Look at her!
François! I'm tired!
There's no hope for me now!
Being bullheaded won't get you anywhere!
Not everyone who kills dies for it.
The police'll work something out.
There's a job opening, boys! A nice little position with overtime!
What are you waiting for?
You couldn't ask for more!
Come down, François! Things will work out! François?
Don't know the guy! He doesn't exist anymore!
Now go away!
Leave me the hell alone! François, we know you!
You're a good man!
Don't be bullheaded!
We'll stand by you! Come down!
What do we do?
We have orders to wait.
Where are you going?
She's hurt!
This isn't a hospital!
I said beat it.
Not until you've heard me out. I've heard enough. Now scram.
Françoise refuses to see me.
So?
I won't stand for this.
I know it's your doing. Then why ask?
I'm not like other men.
You can't hide anything from me. - You're a lucky man.
Lucky?
Oh, sure. The cuckold.
The laughingstock.
A real lucky devil.
You and Clara must have had a good laugh!
I'm not proud. I demand to know what's going on with Françoise.
Don't start that again.
I'm fed up with the indignant father bit.
I was about to go to bed. I slaved all day and I'm tired.
It's simple: I set the alarm, I sleep, the alarm rings and it all starts over.
So now get out! Go on! Scram!
You think I care? A normal human being would – but you're not a human being.
Oh, I'm not?
So I told a little fib the other day.
You shocked? You disgust me.
I do exactly as I please.
And I won't stand –
Will you stand still, for chrissake?
You're like a rat!
Now stand still, for God's sake!
Fine. I'm standing still.
It's funny.
I thought manual laborers had steady nerves.
You're nervous... because you're worried.
And you're worried because some things are beyond you.
Women are complicated, huh? Young ladies are such a mystery.
Shut up or I'll shut you up!
You think you scare me? That's a laugh!
Go ahead and laugh now!
How about I throw you out the window for a good laugh?
Stop it!
Let me go! - I'll let you go, all right! But it's too bad.
I always get dizzy.
Clara's right. I'm getting old.
I should know.
I came up here to do just that.
Well?
See?
I meant to kill you.
The idea came to me just like that. I get a lot of great ideas... but I never see them through.
A loser. - That's right.
I could burst into tears any minute.
But I used to be quite a man.
If you'd known me when I was young, you'd have liked me.
I swear, everyone liked me. I'm sure you were just as rotten as you are now.
Rotten?
Rotten.
It has its advantages.
You're not the rotten type. You're honest, simple, confident.
Isn't that right? Confidence is a beautiful thing. And so is this.
A nice little piece of jewelry.
A fine present for a young girl. What are you trying to say?
And what are you trying to find out?
Shut up. Forget it.
Just shut up. Look what you did.
Funny how simple people have such surprising ideas about women. Love.
Romance.
Sure, women love you.
Women don't love me.
But they find me attractive. And that's everything, you know.
So, since she found me attractive... me and the young girl, we –
How could I resist? I adore youth. That caught your interest, huh?
You want details?
Shut your filthy trap!
Look where it all got you now.
What about you?
Teargas.
Where is he?
Where have they taken him?
François...
I love you.
Keep still.
Maybe I was wrong to tell him I loved him.
He changed. He wasn't the same after that.
Always having to explain.
You understand, François? We love each other. I have faith.
Don't knock so loud.
She's burning with fever.
What is it?
They're gonna use gas.
Gas? They can't! They're gonna suffocate him?
No, it's teargas.
Teargas? It'll burn his eyes, make him cough.
It'll be rough for a minute.
What does Clara matter?
He doesn't love Clara.
There's nothing to say. It's not his fault if he doesn't love her.
I'm the one you love, François. You mustn't get excited.
I can't get up. I can't get up.
Remember what you said?
How we'd go pick lilacs at Easter.
Senator Samuel Foley dead."
Died here at Saint Vincent's.
At the bedside was political sidekick Senator Joseph Paine."
Long distance?
Joseph Paine speaking. I want the governor's residence, Jackson City.
Hello? Oh, Joe!
Oh, no!
Couldn't have happened at a worse time.
Call Jim Taylor. Tell him I'm on a plane for home.
Yes, Joe, yes. Right away.
What is it?
Sam Foley's dead.
Great saints!
Of all times, Foley had to go and die on us.
Who are you calling?
Taylor, my dear.
What's up, Happy?
Sam Foley died tonight.
That's too bad.
Well, don't get excited. Is Paine coming?
Yes, Jim. Yes, Jim.
He'd drop dead if you ever said no.
No, my dear, this is no time for jokes.
I've got to appoint a new senator.
The governor will see all committees.
Tell him I won't wait any longer.
Yes, Mr. Edwards.
Probably got Taylor in there, telling him what to do.
Tell them to wait. I'll see them immediately.
I've got to see those citizens, I can't put them off.
They'll want something to say about who takes Foley's place.
Ten to one they've got a man.
Relax, Happy.
Stop having kittens.
Go and tell Jim Taylor and Joe Paine I give them one minute to make up their minds.
You go tell Jim Taylor.
I will tell him.
It's high time I told Jim Taylor a thing or two.
If you and Joe gab any longer about this appointment I'll see those committees.
You'll see them when we're finished.
Yes, Jim. But hurry, will you?
Yes, we'll hurry. We'll hurry.
That's telling him, Happy, old boy.
Jim, with this Willet Creek Dam coming up the man who takes Foley's place can't ask any questions or talk out of turn.
Got to be absolutely sure.
That's why I say Horace Miller.
He'll take orders all right.
Suppose we don't try to go through with this dam.
Suppose we postpone it until next session of Congress.
Or drop it altogether.
That'd be a crime, Joe.
After all the work we put in on it?
Getting it buried in this Deficiency Bill as nicely as you please.
Having it approved. It's rolling along.
Like taking candy from a baby.
Is it worth the risk of a scandal, with a new man in the Senate?
Worth the risk?
What's the matter with you?
Where you're concerned, I wouldn't take the slightest risk especially with your great reputation in the Senate.
Here, look.
Look at the campaign I started for you in all my papers.
A little obscure, isn't it?
I don't know. Maybe.
But after all, you're the logical man from the West for the national ticket.
At the convention, anything can happen.
Jim, if what you say is possible why not do as I say and drop things like this dam?
We can't do it, Joe.
We've been quietly buying all the land around that dam and holding it in dummy names.
If we drop it now, it'll bring about an investigation.
It'll show that we're going to sell it to the state under phony names.
The smartest thing for us to do is to push this dam through and get it over with.
All right, appoint Miller. If you're sure he'll take orders.
Don't worry. He'll take orders.
Come on.
Just a minute. Just one more minute!
We've got your man.
Horace Miller. - Horace Miller?
A born stooge!
Horace will perform like a trained seal.
What did I tell you?
If I throw a party man like Miller...
For reasons I can't go into, it's got to be him.
Do you understand?
Now make out your ticket.
Come on.
But I've got to see those angry committees first.
Work for harmony. Harmony!
In considering candidates who might have the high qualifications of U.S. senator one name shone out like a beacon the Honorable Horace Miller.
A party man. He's Taylor's stooge!
Please!
New Citizens Committee won't stand for this!
So they named their own candidate, eh?
Who?
You won't like him.
Come on, who?
Henry Hill.
Henry Hill, that crackpot?
You should've killed that so fast...
I couldn't.
Those men were...
Never mind.
You forget about them.
That bunch is out for blood. If I...
I said forget about them.
Horace Miller goes to the Senate, and that settles it.
I won't send Horace Miller.
You won't?
No, I won't.
I won't let you callously wreck my whole political future.
Your political future?
I bought it for you as a present.
I can grab it back so fast it'll make your head swim.
You've got a nerve to sit and worry about your future when we're in a spot like this.
The man is Miller.
Hello, Dad.
What's the matter?
Is it getting you down?
Is what getting me down?
You're in a deuce of a pickle.
Looks like Henry Hill or else.
It's Horace Miller or else.
Peter!
I wouldn't appoint a twerp like Miller, Taylor or no Taylor.
May I ask what Taylor has to do with this?
He's still running the show, ain't he?
I won't have conversation of this sort carried on at dinner.
Why don't you listen to them for a change?
No doubt they can make this appointment for me with ease.
That's easy. Jefferson Smith.
I beg your pardon?
Jefferson Smith. He's the only senator to have.
He ought to be President.
I like Jeff Smith.
Me too.
You too? Now everybody's been heard from.
Forgive my ignorance, but I don't know him from a hole in the ground.
Gosh, head of the Boy Rangers!
Oh, a boy?
No, Dad. Jeff's a man. Jeff Smith.
Biggest expert we got in wild game...
Right now he's the greatest hero we ever had.
It's all over the headlines.
Didn't you see about the forest fire all around Sweetwater?
I did. What about it?
Jeff put that out himself.
Himself?
If you really want a senator...
I do not want a senator.
I do not want any more nonsense.
He's the greatest American we got.
He can tell you what George Washington said, by heart.
And Stuff has the swellest stuff in it.
What "stuff"?
Boys' Stuff. The name of Jeff's paper. He prints it.
It's great. Everybody reads it.
All the kids in the state. A million of them. Let me read...
I'm in no mood to listen to childish prattle.
Prattle?
You're all wet.
You couldn't do better.
Better than what?
Jeff for senator.
Emma, if you please!
Want to get out of a pickle, don't you?
Always looking for votes, aren't you?
Here's 50,000 kids, two folks each, and they vote.
If you want to do some good in this state...
If you're ever going to stand up like a man...
That settles it!
I won't be belittled by my own children in my own home.
All my nerves are strained to the breaking point!
Oh, Shubert. - Henry Hill...
Horace Miller...
Miller? Hill?
Hill?
Miller?
Heads, Hill.
Tails, Miller.
That's good enough for me.
Good evening.
Is Jefferson Smith at home?
Won't you step in?
A Boy Ranger to the U.S. Senate?
Listen.
The simpleton of all times. A big-eyed patriot.
Knows Lincoln and Washington by heart.
Stands at attention in the governor's presence.
Collects stray boys and cats.
He does what?
You know, a perfect man.
Never in politics in his life.
Wouldn't know what it's all about in 2 years, let alone 2 months.
The important thing this was the genius of the stroke it means votes.
The hero of 50,000 boys and 100,000 parents.
Look over those congratulations pouring in.
I tell you, gentlemen...
You made this appointment without asking me.
When lightning strikes...
You didn't ask me.
Oh, Jim!
Now wait a minute, Jim.
Happy may have hit on something here.
There, you see?
Do you really think you can handle him in Washington?
Do you think it's all right?
I think it's all right.
A young patriot recites Lincoln and Jefferson turned loose in our nation's capitol.
Yeah, I think it's all right.
Chick.
Turn the ballyhoo boys loose. It's the greatest appointment ever made.
Give a banquet and declare a holiday.
A star-spangled banquet!
And how did your governor confer that honor?
Did he give it to some wealthy citizen, merely to curry favor?
No! - No!
Did he give it to some unworthy political hireling?
No!
No! What did he do?
He went down among the people.
And there he found a nugget.
It is in that spirit that we're here tonight to acclaim and wish Godspeed to Senator Jefferson Smith.
Thank you.
I can't help feeling that there's been a big mistake somehow.
Of course, I never could see why we needed two senators from this state when we have a man like Joseph Harrison Paine representing us.
He doesn't remember me.
He knew my father very well.
Clayton Smith.
They went to school together.
Just to... sit here with him is a very great honor for me because I remember Dad used to tell me that Joe Paine was the finest man he ever knew.
Go on, get up. Take a bow!
I don't think I'll be much help to you down there in Washington, senator.
I'll do my best.
Although with all my might I can promise you one thing:
I'll do nothing to disgrace the office of United States Senate.
Senator Jefferson Smith the Boy Rangers are very proud to take this opportun...
Occasion!
We are happy to take this opportunity...
To present...
To resent this small token of our affection and esteem to the best...
Friend!
Heck. It's a briefcase, Jeff.
We all pitched in.
For to carry your laws when you get to Washington.
It isn't much, but if you insist, here's this week's.
Boys' Stuff. Why, printer's ink runs in your veins.
You're just like your father.
Thank you, sir.
Even to the hat.
Same old dreamer too.
One look at you and I can see him back at his roll-top desk, hat and all, getting out his paper.
Always kept his hat on so as to be ready to do battle.
Clayton Smith, editor and publisher.
And champion of lost causes.
Dad used to say the only causes worth fighting for were the lost causes.
You don't have to tell me.
We were a team, the two of us.
Struggling editor and the struggling lawyer.
The twin champions of lost causes, they called us.
Ma's told me about it a thousand times.
His last fight was his best, Jeff.
He and his little four-page paper against that mining syndicate.
All to defend the right of one small miner who stuck to his claim.
They tried everything.
Bribery intimidation.
And then...
Ma found him slumped over his desk that morning.
Shot in the back.
I was there.
I can see him.
At that old roll-top desk.
Still with his hat on.
Still with his hat on.
I know.
I suppose, Mr. Paine when a fellow bucks up against a big organization like that one man by himself can't get very far, can he?
No.
Washington, huh?
Yes, senator, for the fifth time. Washington.
I'd better see about my pigeons.
The porter has them.
Just a second. I'd better make sure.
Joe, my head's like a balloon.
Two whole days! I never knew there was so much American history.
They're all right.
That's fine. That ends that crisis.
Come along, senator.
Hello, Father!
I saw!
He's mine!
Oh, let me get to him.
Let me get to him.
Susan, this is...
I don't care to meet him till I get my money.
A dollar each, please, for the milk fund.
That's $5. - Yes.
You've got $5, haven't you?
Can't seem to find anything except keys.
Jeff, this is my daughter Susan and her friends.
Not the new senator?
He's marvelous.
What have you got there, senator?
They're pigeons.
To carry messages back to Ma.
It's just for fun.
The one that makes it home in the best time I'll enter in the Nationals.
Joe!
Hello, Chick.
Hello, Joe.
Carl, how are you?
Glad to see you, Bill.
Jeff, come here.
Meet Cook and Griffith, from State Headquarters.
Great pleasure.
You'll do the old state proud.
Welcome. The wildlife here is different from what you're used to.
They wear high heels.
We must see a lot of you and your little feathered friends.
Come on, Father. - Oh, yeah.
Chick.
I've got him. We'll be along.
Good luck, senator.
Goodbye.
Things sure happen fast around here.
You'll have to get yourself out of low gear.
Let's get these bags and livestock.
Okay, Chick.
Look, there it is!
Who? What?
The Capitol dome.
Yes, sir, big as life.
Been there a long time now.
Yes, sir.
This way, senator.
We thought we'd meet him in short pants with hatchets.
Taxi.
What's he bringing pigeons for?
What for?
Suppose there's a storm. The lines are down.
How you going to get messages back to Ma?
This way, senator.
Where is he?
Senator?
I told that Cookie to...
Let's find him.
Senator!
Senator Smith?
Positively not in the station.
What happened?
Did you look in the...?
Yeah.
I'll brain that guy.
Call Paine. Call Saunders.
Call the Marines. Call somebody!
Saunders?
McGann.
Has Smith showed up at his office there yet?
What do you mean, the slip?
What's so funny?
Nothing. Why don't you try a butterfly net?
If he does show up, Paine's waiting at the hotel with newspapermen.
Let him know right away. Understand?
I'll hang a light in the belfry. One if by land and two if by sea.
Diz?
What do you think?
Yeah.
Daniel Boone's lost. - No.
Lost in the wilds of Washington.
If your boyfriend's going to blaze trails, I'm going to the press club.
He might want us to put on short pants and go hiking.
You wouldn't want to miss the exercise.
When I think of exercise, I lie down until the feeling leaves me.
Wouldn't it be funny if he was lost?
The Boy Ranger?
Oh, he'll show up. He must have a compass with him.
Where would I go if I were a Boy Ranger?
Boy, am I tired. I'm all in!
Call all the hospitals. And get me a bed while you're at it!
Boss, will you hold this a minute?
Thank you, sir.
Here! Come back here!
that from these honored dead we take increased devotion that that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion that we here highly...
Resolve.
Resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain.
That this nation under God, shall have a new birth of...
Freedom.
Freedom.
And that government, of the people by the people, for the people shall not perish from the earth.
Why don't they try the police?
Call out some bloodhounds or Indian guides.
One place he knows is the Senate office. You stay there and wait.
All right, another half-hour.
Just one half-hour. Goodbye.
Oh, why don't I quit?
Eight to five, little boy blue's plastered.
When Foley died, why didn't I clear out?
How many times have I said I'm fed up with politics and I...
No, I let them talk me into staying.
Secretary to a leader of little squirts.
Why?
Because I need the job and a new suit of clothes.
Would you settle for a husband?
I sure would.
You know my old standing offer.
Diz Moore, poet of Washington correspondents.
Oh, that again.
I'd cherish you and I'd stay sober.
Diz, you're a wonderful egg.
I don't know, maybe if I saw you once with your hair combed or something...
I don't think even that would do it.
No point in combing my hair for nothing.
Honorary appointment."
Scratch this and you'll find they need a dope here for a couple of months.
Yes?
Yes!
What do you want?
Office of Jefferson Smith?
No.
The man downstairs said...
They sure must have picked the prize dummy...
Say, wait a minute!
That wouldn't be Daniel Boone?
Say, mister, what's your name?
Jefferson Smith.
Oh, yes, please, come right in, Mr. Smith. This way.
Come in. Now, hold everything. Stay there.
Helen!
Get me the Madison. Senator Paine.
Hurry up, will you?
Is anything the matter?
Oh, no. No.
My dear senator it may be customary out on the prairie to take leave of people and not show up for five hours...
I'm very sorry about that, Miss Sau...
You are Miss Saunders, aren't you?
Yes, and this is Mr. Moore, member of the press.
Mr. Moore, meet the senator.
I'm very happy to know you.
Well, I see you cut your way through that forest.
Senator Paine. We've got him!
Came in on his own power, and he's sober.
Next thing on the schedule, I'll have him over there.
Now... - I'm awfully sorry.
It wasn't until I was well along on the bus that...
Did you say bus?
It was one of those sightseers, you know?
And I've never been called absent-minded before but there it was, all of a sudden.
It was staring at me through the station doors.
There what was?
The dome. The Capitol dome.
As big as life, sparkling away under the old sun out there.
And I I just started to go toward it.
There was a bus outside and I just naturally got aboard.
Most natural thing in the world. - Yeah.
I don't think I've ever been so thrilled in my whole life.
And that Lincoln Memorial!
Gee whiz!
Why, Mr. Lincoln, there he is.
He's looking right straight at you as you come up those steps.
Just sitting there, like he was waiting for somebody to come along.
Yeah. Well, he's got nothing on me.
Oh, I'm sorry.
If you're ready, we'll go to the hotel.
Senator Paine's waiting for you.
This is my office?
No, you'll have a private office.
In there.
Private office?
In there?
Right in this door?
All right, now, senator...
Where is he?
Has he gone out again? - No, no.
He's in there.
I'll see you later.
I got to go out and drink this over.
Whose statue's that?
I wouldn't know, in the daytime.
You wouldn't? Oh, look!
Look at the Capitol dome! It's all lighted up.
You better relax, senator. You'll get yourself plum wore out.
Gee whiz! So many things happening all at once.
Miss Saunders, what time does the Senate...
Convene? - Convene. Convene.
Twelve noon.
Twelve noon, huh?
Oh, boy, that'll be something!
You know what I better do in the morning?
No, what had you better?
I think I better go out to Mount Vernon.
Be sort of a fine thing to do.
Visit Washington's home before walking into the Senate for the first time.
Think it's a good idea?
Wonderful! Puts you right in the mood.
What's that? What's that?
Movie houses.
Hi, Saunders.
I'm still asking myself, what is he:
Animal, vegetable or mineral?
Maybe an oyster.
When I think of myself playing straight for that phony, patriotic chatter. Me!
Carrying bibs for an infant with little flags in his fists.
I can't take it, Diz. I quit. I'm through.
Now take it easy. Simmer down. Here.
Take this.
Know what he's doing tomorrow before taking the Senate seat?
Going up to Mount Vernon to get in the mood.
A warm-up. - Who?
Your boss?
A nut! I knew there was a story in him. I smelled it!
Go chase an ambulance.
It's meat and drink to me. Let me at him five minutes.
I'll make it right with you.
What do you mean "right"?
I'll tell you what I'll do.
World Series. A pass!
In a month it'll be worth 15 bucks.
Well! - You're not talking to this guy.
What do you say?
Nothing. Beat it.
How would your pals like to get in on this?
Hey, I want a scoop.
Beat it!
That's out. Either it's lots of reporters and tickets, or...
Better call him before I change my mind.
Okay. I'll see you right here.
What are you going to do?
Get my whole fall outfit and quit this job in style.
You've got more sense than to put Nosey on to that guy.
That's it! - Open your eyes! Open your eyes!
Tell us about yourself.
I hear you got a boys' club, senator.
Any special ax to grind?
Ax? - You know.
Pet idea. Save the buffaloes, pension bill.
You must have one idea that would be good for the country.
Well, I have got one idea.
That's what we want.
For the last couple years, I've thought it would be a wonderful idea to have a national boys' camp in our state.
Boys' camp? Sure.
Very good!
If we could get poor kids off the streets out of the cities for a few months in the summer and let them learn something about nature American ideals...
Marvelous.
What would it cost the government?
Nothing. Nothing at all.
You see the government just lends us the money for the camp and then the boys pay it back by sending pennies, nickels, nothing more than a dime.
That's really something.
Oh, no, no. Government's got enough on its hands already...
The government's putting too much dough in too many places now, boys.
Well, now, senator, tell me what do you think of the girls in this town?
Down at the station, four of them kissed me when I got off the train.
Were they pretty?
Pretty?
That Miss Susan Paine is about the prettiest I ever saw.
Senator, you got a good eye!
How about some more pictures?
You're a nature lover can you handle sign language?
I could manage, if...
What about birdcalls? You know any?
Can you make a sound like an eagle?
How about a bobwhite?
Here's one. I'm the only one in the state...
His "First 'Whiff' of Washington"?
Do I actually see this?
What is it?
Did you want to see me?
What's this I hear about your quitting?
I'm not a nurse.
Stop being funny.
How'd this happen?
I haven't the slightest idea.
Yes, you have. How'd it happen?
I merely took him home.
I didn't tuck him in. That's McGann's job.
McGann just phoned. Smith's gone again. Do you know where?
He went to Mount Vernon to give himself a patriotic address.
That's fine.
Now you go back to Smith's office and get him to the Senate by 12:00.
Senator, I wasn't given a brain just to tell a Boy Ranger the time.
Don't be a fool.
If certain things happen you'll get one of the biggest jobs in Washington.
When I came here, my eyes were big blue question marks.
Now they're big green dollar marks.
Smart girl, eh?
Finish this job properly and you'll get a bonus.
I mean, keep Smith away from anything that smacks of politics.
Including Willet Creek Dam?
Including Willet Creek Dam.
Now go back to your work.
This is it, senator.
The United States Senate.
Come on.
Mr. Carson, Senator Smith.
How do you do?
How do you do, senator?
Page!
Glad to see you.
Thank you.
Show Senator Smith to his seat.
Yes, sir. Right this way, sir.
Well, goodbye.
Wish me luck.
Sure.
Bye. - Bye.
So that's the boy wonder?
I don't know what the Senate's coming to.
Hi, Diz.
Hello, Saunders.
Daryl, Sweeney. - Hi, Saunders.
I see you got Daniel Boone in all right.
Daniel in the lion's den.
Nice job you and the ambulance chasers did in the papers this morning.
Did you like it?
Great.
Here you are, Senator.
Not a bad desk, either.
Daniel Webster used to use it.
Daniel Webster sat here?
Holy mackerel!
Give you something to shoot at, if you figure on doing any talking.
I'm just going to sit and listen.
That's the way to get re-elected.
This is the calendar for the day.
You'll find this and a manual, in here.
Anything else you want, just snap for a page.
Where's the majority leader?
Majority leader?
Right over there. Senator Agnew.
That's Senator Barnes, the minority leader.
Where's the press gallery?
There, above the vice president's chair.
Those in the front row represent the big news services.
What's up there?
That's for guides and sightseers who come in for five minutes at a time to rest their feet.
That section is reserved for the senators' friends.
Front row, the empty one, is for the President and his guests.
I see.
Over the clock is the diplomatic section.
They and the pageboys are the only real class we have here.
Thanks so much.
I'll take your hat to the cloakroom.
I'd like to give you a Boy Ranger button.
Swell!
What's your name?
Richard Jones.
Thanks ever so much.
Good luck, senator. Keep your left up.
See you in the White House, Joe.
You're not kidding!
Jeff.
Hello, senator.
I was in committee.
That's all right, sir.
I see you had a little publicity.
Have you got your credentials?
Miss Saunders gave them to me.
Is that right?
That's fine.
When the vice president calls you I'll meet you in the center aisle.
Good luck.
This is Daniel Webster's desk. Did you know that?
He won't mind.
Well.
The Senate will come to order.
Chaplain will pray.
Oh, God, our Heavenly Father in these critical days when our beloved country labors with such grave problems look upon us and give us the strength to be just and merciful so we may best serve our people and our fellow men everywhere.
Amen.
Clerk will read...
Mr. President I ask unanimous consent the reading of the journal be dispensed with.
Is there objection?
Journal stands approved.
Mr. President.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
Clerk will call the roll.
Mr. Agnew.
Here.
Mr. Albert.
Here.
Mr. Alfred.
Here.
88 senators have answered to their names, all as present.
Mr. President.
Senator Paine.
I present the credentials of Honorable Jefferson Smith who has just been appointed by the governor of my state.
The designate is present.
I ask that the oath of office be administered at this time.
The senator designate will present himself.
The oath will be administered.
Mr. President I rise to a question of order.
I seek to ascertain if the gentleman about to be sworn in is aware of the responsibilities of his office.
I refer to his shameless performance for the newspapers.
A versatile performance, I grant you and one that his party, no doubt, will applaud.
But one that brings his rank to the level of a sideshow entertainer and reflects on the sincerity, if not the sanity of the highest body of lawmakers in the land.
I seek to learn if this is the gentleman's conception of the nature of his office.
I don't understand.
The designate has no voice here until taking the oath of office.
Mr. President, I will answer the gentleman.
My colleague was innocent in this matter.
He was completely misquoted.
I know Jefferson Smith, and I will personally vouch for him.
He has the greatest respect for his office and for these gentleman.
Mr. President.
The swearing in of the senator designate is the order of business.
The gentleman will raise his right hand.
Do you swear to support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic and that you will bear true faith and allegiance to the same?
That you take this obligation freely without mental reservation or purpose of evasion and that you will faithfully discharge the duties of this office so help you God?
I do.
Senator, you can talk all you want to now.
Meet the majority leader. He'll be a good friend to you.
How do you do, sir?
Any friend of Joe's is a friend of mine.
Don't worry about the others, they're just senators.
Mr. President.
Senator MacPherson.
The shameless way the Deficiency Bill has been delayed is nothing short of criminal.
Government agencies are in desperate need of these funds.
The prime business of this body is the immediate passage...
Hello, Nosey. Who let you in here?
Why aren't you chasing ambulances?
Smith's punching everybody he meets. I just got away.
Tarzan!
Boys, meet Senator Smith.
You act like something's on your mind.
Why don't you tell the people the truth?
The truth?
He wants the truth!
The man wants the truth.
'What is the truth?
' said jesting Pilate and would not stay for an answer."
How do you want it? Dished out or in a bottle?
People pick up their papers, and what do they read?
This morning they read that a clown arrived in Washington parading like a member of the Senate.
If you thought as much about being honest as you do about being smart...
We're the only ones who can be honest in what we tell the voters.
We don't have to be re-elected, like politicians.
We tell them when phonies and crackpots come here to make their laws.
If you want the truth, why are you in the Senate?
What do you know about making laws?
Or what the people need?
I don't pretend to know.
Then what are you doing in the Senate?
What's he doing?
Why, honorary appointment!
When the country needs men who know and have courage as it never did before.
He's going to decorate a chair and get honored.
But he'll vote! Just like his colleague tells him to.
Like a Christmas tiger, he'll nod his head and vote "Yes!"
You're not a senator.
You're an honorary stooge. You ought to be shown up.
Have a drink, senator?
It'll taste better than the truth.
Hey, senator.
Don't let it get you down.
A hundred years from now, nobody'll know the difference.
The point is, sir, they're right.
I'm just sitting in the Senate, decorating a chair.
If I'm going to vote, I ought to study the bills that are coming up.
The bills?
Yes, sir. Otherwise, I'm just a Christmas tiger, like they said.
These bills are put together by legal minds after long study.
I can't understand half of them myself, and I was a lawyer.
Come on. Forget it. When the time comes, I'll advise you how to vote.
I know you will. That's the point.
There's no reason for me to be here.
Didn't you say something about wanting to create a national boys' camp?
You were in earnest, weren't you?
Yes, I was.
Why don't you do it? There's a job for you.
Get a bill started. Present it to Congress.
It will be great experience.
Senator Paine, I've been aching to mention it to you.
If I could do that one thing while I'm here, I'd feel...
What's to stop you? Saunders will help you.
Well, I'll do it. I will!
I knew if anyone could help me, you could.
Thank you again for your time. Good night.
Where are you running off to?
I'm anxious to get back to the office.
The man on the front page!
He just dropped in for a minute.
How do you do, senator?
How do you do, Miss Paine?
I'm on my way to the office.
How are the pigeons?
They're fine.
I miss the dear little things.
I released one this morning with a letter.
He flew right straight up in the air to get his bearings.
He went around the Capitol dome, then headed west, like a bat out of...
Just like a rifle shot.
I suppose by about this time he's probably over Kentucky.
Isn't that wonderful, Father?
And was the letter to your girl?
No, I don't have a girl.
Don't you think I'd better hold this for you?
No, I think I'd better go.
Good night.
Doggone!
It's all right, sir.
That's all right, my boy. Don't bother.
Gee, I'm sorry.
Good night.
Good night, Jeff.
Good night.
Oh, Father!
Dear me! - At the expense of some of the furniture you've made another conquest.
Not old Honest Abe!
And with Honest Abe's ideals.
A rare man these days, Susan.
We're going ahead with it.
Ahead with what?
My bill for a national boys' camp. Where's my briefcase?
Do I understand that you're going to present a bill?
Senator Paine and I decided...
Senator Paine decided with you?
I should have been the one to think of it.
My dear senator, have you the faintest idea how to get a bill passed?
No. You're going to help me.
If I were triplets I could.
Senator Paine said you'd help me.
What do we have to have?
Look, do you mind if I give you a rough idea what you're up against?
No, go ahead.
Well, a senator has a bill in mind, like your camp, right?
Right.
Fine. What does he do?
He has to sit down and write it.
The why, when, where, how and everything else.
That takes time.
But this one is so simple.
Oh, I see. This one's simple.
And with your help...
Oh, I'm helping.
Simple, and I'm helping, so we knock it off in record time, say three or four days.
Oh, a day.
A day?
Yes, just tonight.
Tonight.
I don't want to complain but in civilized countries there's an institution called "dinner."
I'm sort of hungry myself.
Couldn't we have some stuff brought in on trays, like big executives?
Oh, sure.
Dinner comes in on trays.
We light into this...
And we finish the bill before morning.
It's dawn.
Your bill is ready. You introduce it.
How?
You get to your feet, take a breath, and start spouting.
Not too loud. A couple of the senators might want to sleep.
A curly-headed pageboy takes it to the desk where a clerk reads it, refers it to a committee...
Committee, huh? Why?
Committee.
Committees. Small groups of senators have to sift a bill down study it, and report to the Senate.
Can't take a bill nobody ever heard of and discuss it among 96 men.
I see that.
Good. Now, where are we?
Some committee's got it.
Days are going by, senator.
Days, weeks!
Finally, they think it's quite a bill.
It goes to the House of Representatives for a vote but waits its turn on the calendar.
Calendar?
That's the order of business.
Your bill has to stand back in line unless the steering committee...
Steering committee?
Do you really think we're getting anywhere?
Tell me, what's the steering committee?
Committee of the majority party leaders.
They decide when a bill is important enough to be at the head of the list.
Well, this is.
Pardon me. This is.
Where are we now?
Over in the House.
Oh, yeah. House.
More amendments, more changes, and the bill goes back to the Senate.
The Senate doesn't like what the House did; they make more changes.
The House doesn't like those changes. Stymied.
So?
So they appoint men from each House to go into a huddle called a conference, and they battle it out.
Finally, if your bill is still alive after all this vivisection it comes to a vote.
Yes, sir! The big day finally arrives and Congress adjourns.
Catching on, senator?
Shall we start right away or order dinner first?
Pardon me?
I said, shall we start...
Oh, sure.
Why not?
Do you mind if I take the time to go get a pencil?
Go right ahead!
Thank you very much.
Go right ahead. And lots of paper too.
Now, the... Doggone it!
Now, the... Doggone it!
Ever have so much to say about something, you just couldn't say it?
Try sitting down.
I did. I got right back up.
Let's get down to particulars.
How big is this thing? Where is it?
How many boys will it accommodate?
You've got to have all that in it, you know?
Yeah. And something else, Miss Saunders.
The spirit of it. The idea.
How do you say it?
That's what's got to be in it. - What?
The Capitol dome.
On paper?
I want to make that come to life for every boy in this land.
Yes, and all lighted up like that too.
You see, boys forget what their country means by just reading "the land of the free" in history books.
They get to be men and forget even more.
Liberty is too precious a thing to be buried in books, Miss Saunders.
Men should hold it up in front of them every single day of their lives and say I'm free to think and to speak.
My ancestors couldn't.
I can and my children will.
Boys ought to grow up remembering that.
And that steering committee, they've got to see it like that.
I know Senator Paine will do all he can to help me, because...
He's a wonderful man, isn't he?
He knew my father real well.
He did?
We need a lot more like him. His kind of character, his ideals.
Let's get on with this.
Oh, yes.
This camp's out in your state?
About 200 of the most beautiful acres that ever were.
Ever been out in that country?
No.
I've been over every single foot of it. You have to see it yourself.
I don't know.
The prairies, and wind leaning on the tall grass lazy streams down in the meadows angry little midgets of water up in the mountains.
Cattle moving down the slope, against the sun.
Campfires and snowdrifts...
Everybody ought to have some of that, sometime in his life.
My dad had the right idea.
He had it all worked out.
He used to say to me, "Son don't miss the wonders that surround you.
Because every tree, every rock, every anthill, every star is filled with the wonders of nature."
He used to say to me:
Did you ever notice how grateful you are to see daylight after coming through a long, dark tunnel?"
Well," he'd say, "always try to see life around you as if you just came out of a tunnel."
Where did you come from?
I guess I've always lived in a tunnel.
You mean here?
Baltimore. Pure city dweller.
Have you always had to work?
Since I was about 16.
Sixteen?
I take it your parents couldn't...
No, Father was a doctor.
He thought more of ethics than he did of collections.
Speaks well for Father, but it wasn't so...
Now, look, we'd better get back to this.
Hasn't been easy, has it?
No complaints.
For a woman, you've done awfully well.
Have I?
I've never known anyone as capable and intelligent...
I don't know where I'd be in this bill if it wasn't for your help.
I don't know where you are with it.
Oh, yeah. Oh, yes. Now.
Gee whiz, we've got to get going with this.
All right, now, let's see.
Everybody calls you just plain "Saunders." Why can't I?
Go right ahead.
Saunders.
That's much better.
Hello, Saunders." "Good morning, Saunders."
How's the bill coming, Saunders?"
Terrible, thank you.
Anyway, I got that "Saunders" business straightened out.
All right, now! I...
What's your first name?
Why?
Everybody calls you just "Saunders."
I also answer to whistles.
You've got a first name?
Yes, but we just better forget about it.
All right, all right.
I was just curious.
A picture popped into my mind of a pump without a handle or something.
Of course, I know what it is.
No, it isn't.
Abigail?
No.
Letitia?
No.
Lena?
No. Now, stop it. - You might as well tell me.
I've got a lot more.
All right. You win.
It's Clarissa.
Clarissa.
All right, Saunders, let's go!
Now, Susan's an awfully pretty name, isn't it?
Susan? Susan Paine?
Oh, it's beautiful.
She's a beautiful woman, isn't she?
Isn't she a beautiful girl? I think she's about the most beautiful...
We've got to get started on this, or we'll never get it finished.
Get set, because I'm going to talk much faster than you can write.
Okay. You ready?
Yup.
The location of this camp.
About 200 acres situated in Ambrose County, Terry Canyon.
Running a quarter mile on either side of Willet Creek.
What? - Willet Creek.
W-l-L-L-E-T.
It's a little stream.
In Terry Canyon?
You don't know it, do you?
No.
You've never been there, you said.
You've discussed this with Senator Paine, haven't you?
No, no. Why?
Nothing. It doesn't matter.
There's no reason to talk it over with him.
A quarter of a mile on either side of Willet Creek."
And the land to be bought by the contribution of the boys the money to be loaned to us by the United States.
Excuse me. Pardon me.
What did you get me out of bed for?
Sit tight. The show's about to commence.
Mind telling me what's going on? - Certainly.
There's the principal actor in our little play.
Don Quixote" Smith, Man With Bill.
Here, one of the supporting characters.
That gorilla in man's clothing, McGann.
You mean Puss-in-Boots? - Yeah.
Mostly Puss.
Another prominent character in our play, the Silver Knight.
Soul of honor on a tightrope.
You wouldn't be a little goofy, would you?
Diz, Don Quixote will stand up in a minute and speak two important words "Willet Creek."
Then the Silver Knight will fall off his tightrope and "Puss" will jump out of his boots.
It is so ordered.
Introduction of new bills and joint resolutions.
Mr. President!
The chair recognizes the rather strong-lunged junior senator Mr. Smith.
I'm sorry. I have a bill...
You may speak a little louder.
But not too loud.
I have a bill to propose.
Order, gentlemen.
Our junior senator is about to make a speech.
You may proceed.
Be it enacted by the Senate and the House of Representatives that there be appropriated as a loan a sum sufficient to create a national boys' camp to be paid back to the U.S. Treasury by contributions from boys of America.
This camp to be situated on land at and adjacent to the headwaters of a stream known as Willet Creek in Terry Canyon for the purpose of bringing together boys of all walks of life from various parts of the country.
Boys of all creeds, kinds and positions.
To educate them in American ideals and to promote mutual understanding.
To bring about a healthful life to the youth of this great and beautiful land."
Our senator will make a good orator when his voice stops changing.
I'm getting leery of him. We call him dumb, but he keeps getting in our hair.
When he finds out a dam is going up where he wants his boys' camp he's going to ask questions.
Be quiet. I'm trying to think.
This Deficiency Bill will be read tomorrow.
Tomorrow?
He'll hear that section on the Willet Dam.
He can't be there.
I'll take him to see monuments, even if I have to hit him on the head with one.
That won't work.
This boy's honest, not stupid.
Susan.
My daughter won't carry out assignments like that for anybody.
Excuse me.
Beg pardon.
Senator! If you let me handle your publicity...
Down, everybody!
Who are those people?
Phonies, office seekers, cranks.
Get my son in or out of West Point..."
This machine creates a fever 10 miles away. It'll make you a fortune.
Long-distance fevers.
A woman wrote a song to replace "The Star-Spangled Banner."
Want to hear it?
Not today.
I feel like a house afire. Even went to see Mr. Lincoln.
How did I do?
Great.
My heart was right up to here all the time.
What do you think Paine thought?
Tickled pink.
Oh, boy! I hope so.
What's all this?
From boys who read about your camp.
Already?
All these letter...
Those are only local. Wait till they start pouring in from all over.
You mean... I'd better open one up. Let's see what they say here.
Look, there's money. Let me see.
Dear Senator Smith I'd like to come to camp.
Here's 9 cents." Isn't that wonderful?
And he signs it, "Yours truly, Stinky Moore."
Isn't that marvelous?
If there's money in each one of these, what will we do with it?
A bank! That's perfect.
You can see how important this bill will be.
Is there any paper?
Second drawer.
That's fine. I'll be pretty busy tonight.
Not another bill? - Oh, no.
Letters. I'm busting with news!
I introduced a bill. Me, Jeff Smith!
I spoke in the Senate!
Want to dictate them? - The letters?
I couldn't talk letters.
I'll sit here and scratch them down.
And say I'm going to tell Ma all about you.
And if I tell it right, you'll get the best jar of preserves you ever tasted.
Thank you very much.
Oh, and Saunders.
Gee whiz, I forgot to thank you.
Don't mention it.
No, no.
Without you, I couldn't have, I mean...
Hello?
Who?
Susan Paine.
How do you do? Yes, I can talk. Go right ahead.
I'm sorry to bother you, but you've got to help me.
I'm elected to snatch Mr. Smith from the Senate tomorrow.
You're what?
I'm to turn my glamour on for him. You sympathize, don't you?
Awkward, isn't it?
Take him out and buy him a suit of clothes that fits and a hat that he can hang on to.
And a manicure and a haircut wouldn't do any harm.
As one woman to another, I hate to ask you to do this, but...
As one woman to another, of course.
Thanks, and...
Just a minute.
Miss Paine.
Susan Paine?
She wants to talk to me?
Yeah.
What does she?
Holy mackerel.
Hello?
Hello, Miss Paine.
How are you?
Yes.
Fine.
What?
What? Escort you?
Yes.
I'd be delighted.
Yeah, all right.
Reception for a princess?
She wants me to...
Goodbye, Miss Paine.
Goodbye.
What do you know? A reception for a princess.
Can you imagine?
Get your hat.
We have a lot of shopping to do before tomorrow.
Where are your bitters?
In the thing there. Behind the thing.
I don't mind who gets licked in a fair fight.
It's these clouts below the belt I can't take.
Siccing that horrible dame on him when he's goofy about her.
What dame?
Paine.
Better be nice to her.
Her dad's the party choice for the White House.
She may be the next First Lady of the land.
Imagine reading "My Day" by Susan "Paine-In-The-Neck."
He isn't going to be hurt enough. She has to twist a knife in him too.
The regal jackass.
I'll turn my glamour on him," she says.
What's it to you?
Nothing. I'm just saying...
Then stop worrying.
I told you, the dopes will inherit the earth.
I wonder if this Don Quixote hasn't got the jump on all of us.
If it isn't a curse to go through life wised up like you and me.
If you're going to wonder, let's go down and do it over a steak.
Come on, snap out of it. Drink up!
Here's to bigger and better dopes.
And to Don Quixote.
Do you know how I felt?
How did you feel? Quick.
I felt just like a mother.
Sending her kid off to school for the first time.
Watching the little fellow toddling off in his best bib and tucker.
Hoping he can stand up to the other kids.
Say, who started this?
I'm just waiting for a streetcar.
Well, cut it out, see?
Who cares, anyway?
I apologize.
All right, then.
After all, what's it to me? So they drop him out of a balloon.
All I care is, I don't want to be around.
I'm squeamish, see? That's what I am.
No, sir.
I don't have to take it. I won't be party to murder.
I'm going to quit. I'm through.
Again? It's a good idea.
Diz?
Yeah.
Let's get married.
It's a good idea.
When?
Anytime.
Tonight?
Okay.
You don't mind?
I'd cherish you.
You're a good egg, Diz.
I know.
Maybe we could clear out of this town.
Get to feel like people.
Live like we just got out of a tunnel.
Tunnel?
A tunnel.
You've never seen prairie grass with the wind leaning on it, have you, Diz?
Does the wind get tired out there?
Or angry little mountain streams or the sun moving against the cattle?
You've never seen anything like that, have you, Diz?
Have you?
No.
Do we have to?
I can't think of anything more sappy.
Okay, then let's get going.
Where?
We're getting married.
Oh, yes, that's right.
In case you don't know, I want to give you a chance to back out.
What?
My first name's Clarissa.
I know. It's okay.
Don't say "okay." Say you think it's beautiful.
Okay. I mean...
You don't know any name offhand that you like better, do you?
Not offhand.
Nothing like "Susan" or anything?
Susan?
I won't take it, see?
I won't be party to murder, see?
Steering a poor dope up blind alleys for that Taylor mob is low enough but helping that dame cut him in little bits nobody's going to make me do that!
You said it.
I'm going to get out of there right now. Right now.
Bonus or no bonus. I'm clearing out.
Everything I own. My extra hat, everything.
Wait a minute.
We're getting married!
Right now, everything.
See you later.
Saunders? Saunders?
What do you want?
You should have been there.
I know.
It was a wonderful party, and your suit went over big and she looked beautiful.
And when you left she said:
Thank you, Mr. Smith."
But it was the way she said it. You nearly fell through the floor.
Horseradish.
What are you looking at?
You didn't think I was a lady, did you?
A lady wouldn't work for this outfit.
Even I can't take it anymore. I quit.
There's a lot I can't take.
Can't take a simple...
Why don't you go home?
Tell your little streams about your camp and the land of the free.
This is no place for you. You're halfway decent.
Now go home!
That's all I wanted to tell you.
Meet the man I'm going to marry.
That's me.
Say something. Don't just stand there like a...
Wait a minute.
Why don't I do this right?
So you want to be a senator? Build a camp on Willet Creek?
See this? Deficiency Bill.
Section 40. A dam going up where you think your camp will be.
Ever hear of it? No.
They read about it in the Senate today, but you weren't supposed to hear.
That's why that ritzy dame took you in tow.
That's why they sent you here. You don't know a dam from a bathtub.
Go ahead. Be a senator.
Try and mess up Mr. Taylor's little graft.
But if you can't and you can't in 9 million years...
Go home! Don't stay around here making people feel sorry for you.
Come on, Diz.
Hey! This way.
Come on, kid. We'll dig up a preacher.
We're going to get married.
Oh, yeah.
Okay.
Come on, I'll take you home.
There are 100 other places in the state that really need the water.
Kenneth Allen owns some land there. He didn't mention a dam.
There's something wrong here. I know there is.
I won't vote on it till I get some questions answered.
Jeff, you're fighting windmills.
Trying to understand everything about a project that took two years to set up.
The reasons, the benefits.
The benefits? Who is Taylor?
What?
What's he got to do with this?
What makes you think he's got anything to do with it?
I've heard that this is all his idea to get graft.
Do you know what you're saying?
You're accusing me of framing a bill for one individual's benefit.
Of helping to put through a scheme for graft.
Long distance?
Get me James Taylor, Jackson City.
Boy Ranger, eh?
Answer to a prayer? Manna from heaven.
Didn't even know how to tell time.
Will you tell me exactly what he's done?
He's about to blow the machine to smithereens, and you with it.
Me, Jim?
How?
You wouldn't understand that.
Listen to me, Mr. Ten-Thumbs, I'm on my way to Washington.
No matter what happens, I'm all ready for that Boy Ranger of yours.
Take your instructions from Ken Allen.
I wouldn't trust you to lick a stamp.
Use your high office to help Alan get things done.
Do you understand?
Yes, Jim.
I doubt it. Come on, Alan.
I haven't been able to show him a single monument. Not even one that high.
No, he's been on our tail. You've got to keep this guy off of us.
Ever since he found out we represent the Creek, he's been running us ragged.
I told you I'd handle him. I object to you coming here like this.
You proved how you can handle him.
You're the one that started him writing bills.
Chick, let him in.
You didn't ask Smith here?
What do you think?
Don't open that door. Jim, you can't do this.
Let him in, Chick.
All right, Jim.
You can count me out.
Good morning, senator. Come right in.
What did you mean, count you out?
You can't come here and pull that steamroller stuff.
Your methods won't do here.
He's a senator. However it happened, he's a senator.
This is Washington.
Steamroller stuff?
My methods don't go in Washington?
They've done well by you.
That's beside the point. This boy's different. He's honest.
He thinks the world of me. We can't do it!
What am I supposed to do?
Stand around and let that drooling infant wrap that Willet Creek Dam appropriation around my neck?
Not me.
Either he falls in line with us or I'll break him so wide open they'll never find the pieces.
Jim, I won't stand for it.
You won't stand for it?
I don't want any part of crucifying this boy.
I see.
Our steamroller methods are too hard for your sensitive soul. Is that it?
The Silver Knight is getting too big for us.
My methods have been all right for the past 20 years.
Since I picked you out of a flyspecked hole-in-the-wall and blew you up to look like a senator.
And now you can't stand it?
Maybe you don't have to stand it.
Maybe we can fix it so you and the boy can go home together.
You don't have to...
It's all right, it's all right.
Seems a shame, though, to part company like this after all these years.
Especially now, with a national convention coming up.
Joe, I put everything I have behind you.
And so did all of our friends.
I guess we'll survive.
We'll just find somebody else who's got a little more sense.
In the meantime, you go in and explain to Mr. Smith about Willet Dam.
It's your bill. It's your reputation.
If he can't find enough facts to break you with send him to me.
I'll give him a couple of good ones.
I'm taking the next plane home. So long.
Jim.
Yeah?
Come here, will you?
It's just that I like the kid.
I don't want to see you get too rough on him.
I'm glad you came to your senses.
You had me scared there for a minute.
Go back to your office. I'll call you when I get through with Smith.
Okay.
The Silver Knight."
Hello, senator.
I was just passing through. I thought I'd like to meet you.
Sit down. You met all the boys here, I suppose.
They say you've been on your toes since you got here.
That's fine.
You know, some people told me that you were dumb.
I think you're smart.
You're smart enough to understand a situation when it's explained to you.
Like what?
Well, for instance building a dam on Willet Creek.
Just what's your interest in this?
What's my interest?
Anything that benefits the state is mighty important to me.
Owning a lot of its industry, newspapers and other odds and ends.
If I felt you had the welfare of the state at heart like I have I'd say you were a man to watch.
Now, what do you like?
Business?
If you do, you can pick any job in the state and go to the top.
Or politics.
If you like being senator, there's no reason why you can't come back and stay there as long as you want.
If you're smart.
Now, you take the boys here, or Joe Paine.
They're doing all right.
They don't have to worry about being re-elected or anything else.
They're smart. They take my advice.
You tell these men and Senator Paine what to do?
Why, yes.
Joe Paine has been taking my advice for the past 20 years.
You're a liar.
I've got to see Senator Paine.
Senator Paine is out of town.
Out of town?
He couldn't be.
Hello, Jeff. Come in.
Well, did you have a talk with Taylor?
He said he's told you what to do for 20 years.
I called him a liar.
Come over here and sit down.
I don't feel like sitting down.
Oh, I know how you feel.
I was hoping you'd be spared all this.
I was hoping that you would see the sights, absorb some history, and go back to your boys.
You've been living in a boy's world. For heaven's sake, stay there.
This is a man's world.
It's brutal, and you've no place in it.
You'll only get hurt. Take my advice. Forget Taylor and what he said.
Forget you ever heard of Willet Creek Dam.
But you still haven't answered me, sir.
Can a man like Taylor tell you and those other men what to do?
Now, listen, Jeff, please and try to understand.
I know it's tough to run head-on into facts.
This is a man's world, and you got to check your ideals outside the door, like you do your rubbers.
Now, 30 years ago I had your ideals.
I was you.
I had to make the same decision you were asked to make today.
And I made it.
I compromised. Yes.
So I could sit in that Senate and serve the people in 1000 honest ways.
You got to face facts.
I've served our state well, haven't I?
We have the lowest unemployment and the highest federal grants.
But I've had to compromise.
I've had to play ball. You can't count on people voting.
Half the time they don't vote, anyway.
That's how states and empires have been built since time began, understand?
Well, Jeff.
You can take my word for it. That's how things are.
Now, I've told you all this because I've grown very fond of you.
About like a son, in fact.
And I don't want to see you get hurt.
When that Deficiency Bill comes up tomorrow, don't say a word.
Great powers are behind it, who'll destroy you before you start.
For your own sake and for the sake of my friendship with your father please don't say a word.
Owing to the urgency of the Deficiency Bill there is a unanimous consent agreement that no one will speak more than once or longer than five minutes on any section of the bill.
Clerk will read.
The bill for deficiency appropriations for the fiscal year, Section One.
On emergency relief:
To create and erect public improvements on rivers harbors and roadways, $150 billion.
Section 40: An appropriation to divert and impound Willet Creek to the natural basin of Terry Canyon, $5 million."
Mr. President?
Senator Smith desires to be heard on Section 40?
I do, sir.
The senator understands he's limited to five minutes?
Yes, sir.
You may proceed, sir.
Mr. President, this section of the bill, this dam on Willet Creek is nothing but...
Does Senator Smith wish to yield to his colleague?
Why, yes, sir.
You may proceed, senator.
Mr. President I have risen to a difficult task to say from evidence that has come to my attention I consider Senator Smith unworthy to address this body.
You boys go out and get the senators. - Yes, sir.
Something going on inside, come on.
The senator will suspend until order is restored.
All senators are wanted on the floor, please.
What's going on?
I don't know.
You may proceed.
I refer to the bill he has introduced for the creation of a national boys' camp.
He named a portion of land to be dedicated to that purpose and to be bought by contributions from boys all over America.
Senators I have evidence to prove my colleague owns the land described in his bill.
He bought it the day after his appointment to the Senate and is holding it using his privileged office for his own personal profit!
Boy Ranger had a wreck.
This doesn't make sense.
Accordingly I offer a resolution an inquiry by the Committee of Privileges and Elections as to the fitness of my colleague to continue to sit in this chamber.
Mr. President, I...
Order!
Chairman, clear the galleries unless order is restored.
Flash! Ranger senator branded by colleague.
Flash! Paine brings charges to expel Smith.
Where's Saunders?
She'll have the lowdown.
I wish I knew. She left town in that jalopy of hers.
Paine accuses Smith of introducing a boys' camp built for his own profit.
Give me a cigarette.
Paine's asked for a hearing before the Committee.
Well, frankly, my dear senators the morning that Mr. Allen burst into my office bringing proof that Smith had the deed to that campsite I was dumbfounded!
Pardon me, what did you do when this was brought to your attention?
I consulted with the head of the Department of Records Mr. Arthur Kim.
Mr. Kim, do you remember recording such a deed?
Yes.
On the date set forth here, Mr. Allen came before me to record this deed setting over 200 acres in the name of Jefferson Smith.
How long have you known Senator Smith, Mr. Allen?
Oh, a good many years.
He used my land by Willet Creek every summer for his Boy Rangers.
Seemed like a mighty nice fellow. One day he made a proposition.
Said he had a chance to sell that land for at least $500 an acre.
I'd be glad to get 25 for it. So we set it up like this:
I deeded him the land, and he gave me a contract guaranteeing me half, if he made the sale.
Mind you now, the whole thing sounded fishy at the time.
That contract you mentioned, have you got that document?
That land wouldn't be in his name if I didn't.
Yes, sir. Signed and delivered.
I never signed any such contract!
He certainly did!
Just a moment, please.
After a long study of this signature, it is my professional opinion that it is definitely in Jefferson Smith's own handwriting.
As an expert on handwriting I'd say the name of Jefferson Smith on this contract has been forged.
I would stake my whole 20 years professional career on the fact that this is not a forgery but is Mr. Smith's own signature.
This is a very painful duty for me.
This boy's the son of my very best friend.
I sponsored him in the Senate. I helped frame his bill.
When he presented it, I went to congratulate him but pointed out a dam was already going up on the very site he'd chosen for his camp.
There are other good campsites nearby so I suggested he choose another.
He became furious.
He said, "Move the dam."
I was amazed at his violent reaction. I couldn't understand.
Until the evidence came to me that he owned those very 200 acres.
And as you have heard had carefully laid plans to make an enormous profit out of the nickels and dimes scraped together by the boys of this country.
Faced with that regardless of my personal feelings for the boy my sense of duty told me his expulsion from the Senate was the only possible answer.
Beautiful, that Taylor machine.
Senator Smith, please.
Will you take the chair, please?
The Committee is ready to hear you now, Senator Smith.
Keep your seats, gentlemen!
Committee is not adjourned yet.
Quiet! Please!
That Ranger never knew what struck him when Jim Taylor opened up on him.
Which one of you girls wants this?
Do you want it? - Oh, yes.
You know, I had a hunch I'd find you here when you weren't anyplace else.
How've you been, Saunders?
Oh, all right.
Your husband. How's he?
My...?
Oh.
Old Diz. We're not married.
Good thing I got back just when I did. You know what I found waiting for me?
No.
Jar of preserves from your mother.
Oh, you did?
What was it, strawberry?
That's the best kind.
Well, I...
I see by the papers you certainly got to be a senator.
You sure had the right idea about me, Saunders.
You told me to go back home and keep filling those kids full of hooey.
Just a simple guy, you said, still wet behind the ears lot of junk about American ideals.
That's certainly a lot of junk, all right.
Now look, senator...
I don't know this is a whole new world to me.
What are you going to believe in when a man like Senator Joseph Paine gets up and swears that I've been robbing kids of nickels and dimes?
A man I've admired and worshiped all my life.
I don't know.
A lot of fancy words in this town.
Some of them are carved in stone, some of them...
Guess the Taylors and Paines put them up there so suckers like me can read them.
Then when you find out what men actually do...
Well, I'm getting out of this town so fast away from all the words and the monuments and the whole rotten show.
I see.
When you get home, what will you tell those kids?
Well, I'll tell them the truth.
Might as well find it out now as later.
I don't think they'll believe you.
They're liable to look up at you with hurt faces and say:
Jeff, what did you do? Quit?
Didn't you do something about it?"
Well, what do you expect me to do?
An honorary stooge like me against the Taylors and Paines and machines and lies.
Your friend Mr. Lincoln had his Taylors and Paines.
So did every other man who tried to lift his thought up off the ground.
Odds against them didn't stop them, they were fools that way.
All the good that ever came into this world came from fools with faith like that.
You can't quit now. Not you.
They aren't all Taylors and Paines in Washington.
That kind just throw big shadows, that's all.
You didn't just have faith in Paine, or any other living man.
You had faith in something bigger.
You had plain, decent, everyday common rightness and this country could use some of that.
So could the whole cockeyed world. A lot of it.
Remember the first day you got here?
Remember what you said about Mr. Lincoln?
That he was waiting for someone to come along?
You were right.
He was waiting for a man who could see his job and sail into it.
Who could tear into the Taylors and root them out into the open.
I think he was waiting for you.
He knows you can do it. So do I.
What? Do what, Saunders?
You make up your mind you won't quit, and I'll tell you what.
Been thinking about it all the way back here.
It's a 40-foot dive into a tub of water, but I think you can do it.
Clarissa where can we get a drink?
Now you're talking.
Come on over to my place.
Mr. Dearborn. Mr. Dearborn.
Mr. Dernell.
Mr. Dwight.
Here.
They're going to expel Smith today, eh?
Where are the drums? Where's the guillotine?
In fact, where's Smith?
Hasn't stopped running since he left the Committee.
Mr. Singleton.
Here.
Mr. Smith.
Here!
That guy's batty.
The clerk will continue with the roll call.
Mr. Williams.
Here comes Saunders.
Is this some of your shenanigan?
What's the matter?
Pray, Diz, if you know how.
Did you have anything to do with bringing that guy in here?
Are you crazy?
Ninety senators have answered to their names.
Quorum is present.
Proceeding now to the regular order.
Mr. President.
Senator MacPherson.
I desire to call up the report of the Committee on the expulsion of Jefferson Smith.
Clerk will read the report.
The Committee on Privileges and Elections reports it appears to the satisfaction of the Committee after hearing a number of witnesses that justice requires that Smith no longer continue a member of this body.
They report this resolution with recommendation that the same do pass.
Resolved: That Jefferson Smith be expelled from his seat in the Senate."
Mr. President.
I move for the immediate adoption of the resolution.
Now.
Mr. President!
I addressed the chair first. - I have the floor.
I'm asking for a roll call on the passage of the resolution without further delay.
The senator can have nothing to say that would not...
However, Senator Smith is still a member of this body and has an equal claim on the attention of this chair.
You were about to recognize me.
That was merely your impression.
Let him speak!
Before proceeding further I remind the visitors in the gallery they are here as our guests and should conduct themselves as such.
And I might add that their sentiments in no way will affect the judgment of this chair.
The chair recognizes Senator Smith.
Thank you, sir.
Diz, here we go.
I guess the gentlemen are in a tall hurry to get me out of here.
The way the evidence is piled up against me, I can't blame them much.
And I'm willing to go when they vote it that way but before that happens, I've got a few things to say.
I tried to say them once before and I got stopped colder than a mackerel.
I'd like to get them said this time.
I'm not going to leave until I do get them said.
Will the senator yield?
Senator yields?
No, sir, I'm afraid not!
No, sir.
I yielded the floor once before, and I was practically never heard of again.
No, sir.
And we might as well all get together on this "yielding" business right off the bat now.
I had some good coaching last night, and I find that if I yield only for a question, point of order or personal privilege that I can hold this floor almost until doomsday.
In other words, I've got a piece to speak and blow hot or cold, I'm going to speak it.
Will the senator yield?
Will Senator Smith yield?
Yield how?
Will he yield for a question?
All right.
I wish to ask my junior colleague, this piece he intends to speak does it concern Section 40 of that bill, the dam on Willet Creek?
Every aspect of this matter, everything was dealt with in committee.
I ask my distinguished colleague, has he one scrap of evidence to add now to the defense he did not give at that same hearing?
I have no defense against forged papers!
The committee ruled otherwise!
The gentleman stands guilty as charged.
I believe I speak for every member when I say that no one cares to hear what a man of his condemned character has to say about any section of any legislation before this House!
Order, order, gentleman!
Mr. President I stand guilty as framed because Section 40 is graft.
And I was ready to say so.
I was ready to tell you that a certain man in my state, Mr. James Taylor wanted to put through this dam for his own profit.
A man who controls a political machine and controls everything else in my state.
A man even powerful enough to control congressmen.
I saw three of them in his room the day I went to see him.
Will the senator yield?
I will not yield!
This same man, James Taylor, came down here and offered me a seat in this Senate for the next 20 years if I voted for a dam that he knew and I knew was a fraud but if I dared to open my mouth against that dam he promised to break me in two.
I got up here and I started to open my mouth and the long and powerful arm of Mr. Taylor reached into this sacred chamber and grabbed me by the scruff of the neck...
Mr. President, a point of order.
Mr. President?
Senator Paine will state it.
It was I who rose in this chamber to accuse him.
He's saying that I was carrying out criminal orders on falsified evidence.
He has imputed to me conduct unworthy a senator, and I demand that he yield the floor.
I did not say that Senator Paine was one of the congressmen in that room!
I was in that room!
Order, gentlemen. Order, gentlemen.
I accuse this man.
By his tone, by his careful denials he is trying to plant damaging impressions on my conduct.
I'll tell you why we were in that room.
Because Mr. Taylor, a respected citizen of our state had brought with him the evidence against this man and we were urging him to resign.
Why? To avoid bringing disgrace upon a clean and honorable state.
But he refused!
Mr. President...
There is only one answer to a man like him.
The truth, which I rose and gave to this body.
Mr. President he is trying to blackmail this Senate as he tried to blackmail me.
To prevent his expulsion, he'll even try to hold up this Deficiency Bill vital to the country, which must be passed immediately!
Have I the floor?
I have lost all patience with this brazen character.
I apologize to this body for his appointment.
I regret I ever knew him. I'm sick of this contemptible young man.
And I refuse to stay here and listen to him any longer.
I hope every member of this body feels as I do.
Get off the floor!
Yield the floor!
Gentlemen!
Gentlemen, please address the chair!
Mr. President, what does the gentleman want of this body?
I'll tell you, sir!
I want a chance to talk to people who'll believe me.
The people of my state, they know me and they know Mr. Taylor.
When they hear my story, they'll rise up and kick Taylor's machine to kingdom come.
I want one week to go back there and bring you proof.
In the meantime, I want this Senate's promise that I won't be expelled and this bill will not be passed.
Will the senator yield?
For a question.
Has the gentleman the effrontery to stand, convicted and in disgrace and try to force postponement of the Deficiency Bill?
For one week.
Mr. President!
I appeal to the senator.
Is he fully aware that this bill has been months in both Houses delayed and delayed?
Millions will be without food and shelter.
Public works will be at a standstill!
Will we keep relief from the country?
The people of my state need relief from crooked men riding their backs!
Mr. President, if the Senate yields to this sort to blackmail, it'll become a laughingstock.
It is an insult to this body to have to listen.
An insult to our colleague, Senator Paine.
I, for one, will follow the senator's example and refuse to remain in this chamber as long as that man holds the floor!
Order, gentlemen!
I guess I'll have to speak to the people of my state from right here!
I'll tell you wild horses won't drag me off this floor until those people have heard everything I've got to say, if it takes all winter!
Filibuster!
Well, Mr. President, we seem to be alone.
I'm not complaining for social reason, it's just...
I think it'd be a pity if these gentlemen missed any of this. And...
I call the chair's attention to to Rule Five of the Standing Rules of the Senate.
Section... Section Three.
If it shall be found that a quorum is not present a majority of the senators present..."
And that looks like me.
...may direct the sergeant at arms to request, and if necessary...
Well, Mr. President, I so direct.
The absence of a quorum being suggested.
Bring the call to quorum.
Call to quorum.
There's no hurry, Mr. President. I got plenty of time.
Quorum call! Call to quorum!
All senators wanted on the floor!
Clerk will call the roll.
Mr. Agnew.
Here.
Mr. Albert.
Mr. Alfred.
Mr. Ashman.
Here.
Joe, get this! Smith got the floor and is holding it.
Just as they were about to kick him out! - He did it, Diz.
It's wonderful!
It was terrific!
A filibuster! This is the miracle I wanted.
What a yarn!
Get everything he says back to that home state.
It's a pleasure!
They're going to hear this in Patagonia.
In protest, the whole Senate body walked out!
Not that straight stuff. Kick it up.
Get on his side. Fight for him, understand?
You love this monkey, don't you?
What do you think?
Now go to work. Do as I tell you.
Take this: This is the most titanic battle of modern times.
A David without even a slingshot rises to battle against the mighty Goliath, the Taylor machine allegedly crooked inside and out.
Yeah. For my money you can cut out the "allegedly."
We're bringing everybody up from headquarters.
Where are they?
Come on, get these telegraphs moving!
You get Hendricks?
They're looking for him.
They're looking for him." An editor.
Why isn't he at his desk, where he belongs?
Don't you think you better get back to that Senate?
The boy's talking to that state.
If he can raise public opinion against us...
He'll never get started.
I'll make public opinion within 5 hours. I've done it all my life.
I'll blacken this punk so...
Leave public opinion to me.
Now, go back into the Senate and keep those senators lined up.
I hit him from the floor with everything I knew.
I haven't got the stomach for it anymore.
If he convinces those senators, you might as well blow your brains out.
This is the works, Joe!
Either we're out of business or we're bigger than ever.
We can't stop at anything until we smash this yokel...
Hendricks on the phone.
Go back to the Senate, will you?
Hello, Hendricks. Well, the chips are down.
Keep everything that Smith says, or any other pro-Smith stuff out of all our newspapers.
And all the others you can line up in the state.
Those broken-down opposition papers, who won't play ball with us I want you to tie up for 24 hours.
Stall their deliveries. Push them off the street. I don't care!
Bury them for 24 hours. That'll give me plenty of time.
And you defend the machine. Hit this guy!
The usual thing. Criminal, and blocking a relief bill and starving the people.
Joe, will you get back into that Senate?
And Hendricks, get the hoi polloi excited.
Have them send protest letters, wires, anything you like.
Buy every minute you can of every radio station in the state and keep them spouting against Smith.
I don't care what it costs. Pay out.
Get moving. Get the whole state moving!
This filibuster is a cowardly attempt to turn your attention from the true facts which are beyond question.
Jefferson Smith was caught red-handed, stealing from boys.
Relief will be stopped. Men thrown out of jobs.
I've seen filibustering, but...
Smith can't go on. It's ridiculous.
We've got to get him off the floor.
As long as Mr. Smith holds that floor legitimately he's going to continue to hold it.
If you ask me, that fellow's making sense.
Sense? You call blackmail sense, Henry?
Joe, I didn't like this boy from the beginning.
But we feel that no man who wasn't sincere could fight like this against these odds.
I'm very glad to know that, Martin.
After 20 years, I'm very glad to know you'd take his word against mine.
Yes, that's what it means!
If he's that much right, then I'm wrong.
Joe, can't we work out some deal to pull that Willet Dam out and let the Deficiency Bill go through?
It isn't a question of Willet Dam.
It's a question of my honor and reputation.
The integrity of the Committee, the integrity of the Senate itself.
If you want to throw out Section 40, go ahead.
I'll resign.
Now, wait a minute, Joe.
This is a lot of nonsense.
Joe's right. A deal is impossible.
We've got to go on with this.
Break him, keep him talking.
No relief. Maintain a quorum in relays.
Is that how you feel, John?
I agree with you.
It's time to relieve the floor.
How a man that green knows as much as he does...
Can't go on much longer.
...that they're entitled by their creator with certain inalienable rights.
And that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of..."
Well, looks like the night shift's coming on.
Senator will please suspend until order is restored.
This is H.V. Coltenborn speaking.
Half of official Washington is here to see democracy's finest show the filibuster:
The right to talk your head off.
The American privilege of free speech in its most dramatic form.
The least man in that chamber once he gets and holds that floor, by the rules can hold it and talk as long as he can stand on his feet.
Providing always that he does not sit down and that he does not leave the chamber or stop talking.
The galleries are packed.
In the diplomatic gallery are the envoys of two dictator powers.
They have come here to see what they can't see at home democracy in action.
life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness and to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed that whenever any form of government becomes destructive to these ends it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it." "...
How am I doing?
Quit stalling and move!
Clark, Jim.
Oh, Clark...
Mr. Taylor?
Yes, wait a minute.
Phone Senator Paine about it.
This is Jim Taylor in Washington. About this Smith filibuster.
Newspapers in the Southwest must realize that this bill he's trying to block will affect your section as well as any.
It's the patriotic duty of every newspaper...
Wait a minute. Yes?
Jackson City calling.
Hold them!
We've got to keep hammering at this man until we smash him!
I get a great kick out of that part of the Declaration of Independence.
You're not going to have a country that can make these rules work if you haven't got men that have learned to tell human rights from a punch in the nose.
That's good for a headline.
It's a funny thing about men, you know.
They all start life being boys.
I wouldn't be surprised if these senators were boys once.
That's why it seemed like a good idea to get the boys out of crowded cities and stuffy basements for a couple of months out of the year and build their bodies and minds for a man-sized job because they're going to be behind these desks someday.
It seemed like a good idea, getting boys from all over the country.
Boys of all nationalities and ways of living.
Getting them together let them find out what makes different people tick.
Because I wouldn't give you 2 cents for all your rules if behind them they didn't have a little ordinary everyday kindness and a little looking out for the other fellow too.
That's pretty important, all that.
It's just the blood and bone and sinew of this democracy that some great men handed down to the human race, that's all!
But if you've got to build a dam where that boys' camp ought to be to pay off some political army, that's a different thing.
If you think I'm going back and tell those boys in my state:
Fellows, forget about it.
All I've been telling you about the land you live in is a lot of hooey.
This isn't your country. It belongs to a lot of James Taylors." No, not me.
Anybody here that thinks I'd do that, they got another thing coming!
I just wanted to find out if you still had faces.
Oh, I'm sorry, gentlemen.
I know I'm being disrespectful to this honorable body.
A guy like me should never be allowed to get in here in the first place.
And I hate to stand here and try your patience like this, but I...
Either I'm dead right or I'm crazy!
You wouldn't care to put that to a vote, would you, senator?
Will the senator yield for a question?
I yield.
In view of the gentlemen's touching concern for the senators and the fact that he's been talking for 7 and one half hours and must be very, very tired would he permit a motion to recess until the morning at which time he may better continue with his profound babblings.
No. No, don't!
Ask him!
Mr. President, what happens in the morning I mean, about my having this floor to go on with my "babblings"?
If the senator permits this motion for a recess he won't have the floor in the morning to babble with or anything else unless he is recognized first by this chair.
As I was saying, gentlemen I'm either dead right or I'm crazy and I feel fine.
What have you got, Dick?
From Miss Saunders.
Is the senator yielding the floor?
Yield?
Oh, no. Oh, no!
I feel fine!
The Constitution of the United States.
Page one, top left-hand corner.
We the people of the United States in order to form a more perfect union..."
Yeah? Well, buy it or wreck it!
Brady's column too? Holy smokes!
What's the matter?
This is murder, you got to call him off.
He's getting nowhere.
What are you talking about?
Not one word of what he says is being printed in that state.
Oh, no!
Taylor has practically every paper in the state lined up and he's feeding them doctored-up junk!
One man muzzling a whole state?
And how!
Freedom of the press!
Wait a minute! I've got an idea!
Jeff has a paper there, Boy Stuff, right?
Terrific! - Look.
They aren't letting what Jeff says get printed in the state.
If I give you a raft over the phone now...
Write me a front-page raft, Diz.
Can you print it out and spread a billion copies of it?
Swell!
Get ready to take it down, will you, Mrs. Smith?
All right.
Boys, everything about Jeff.
Get pencils and paper, quick!
All right, here we go!
All ready, Clarissa.
She called me Clarissa!
Okay, Ma!
Jeff Tells Truth.
Shows Up Taylor."
I want the whole morning edition.
Push him off the floor!
Start your campaign for protests. Wired!
Willet Dam is a fraud to line the pockets of the Taylor machine."
Here's your front-page editorial. Wait!
A convicted thief representing you holds the floor of the United States Senate."
All right, boys. Hurry up!
She said rush! Get cracking now!
Come on! Bring on the paper!
...charity wanteth not itself is not propped up and now abideth faith hope, charity these three.
The greatest of these is charity."
Read about Jeff.
Boy's Stuffcirculars. Peddled by 9 million kids.
What are you standing there for?
Get the boys out! Kill it!
BOY RANGERS
Get these papers out of here.
Read all about it!
Jeff Smith lies in Senate!
Wire Congress!
Are we going to let a man like Jeff throw mud at a man like Joe Paine?
Are you for Joe Paine?
Hurray for Jeff Smith!
Children hurt all over the city.
Tell Jeff to stop!
Yes. Yes, all right.
Yes. Goodbye.
Senator Smith has now talked for 23 hours and 16 minutes.
The most unusual and spectacular thing in the Senate annuls.
One lone and simple American holding the greatest floor in the land.
What he lacked in experience, he's made up in fight.
But those tired Boy Ranger legs are buckling.
Bleary-eyed, voice gone.
He can't go on much longer.
And all official Washington is here to be in on the kill."
There's no compromise with truth.
That's all I got up on this floor to say.
When was it?
A year ago, it seems like.
Terrible things are happening. I've got to stop him.
They're listening to him. Anything might happen now.
Just get up off the ground. That's all I ask.
Get up there with that lady that's on top of this Capitol dome.
That lady that stands for liberty.
Look at this country through her eyes if you want to see something.
But you won't just see scenery.
You'll see the whole parade of what man's carved out for himself after centuries of fighting.
Fighting for something better than just jungle law.
Fighting so he can stand on his own two feet, free and decent like he was created.
No matter what his race, color or creed.
That's what you'd see.
There's no place out there for graft or greed or lies or compromise with human liberties.
If that's what the grownups have done with this world we better get those boys' camps started fast and see what the kids can do.
It's not too late.
Because this country is bigger than the Taylors or you or me or anything else!
Great principles don't get lost once they come to light.
They're right here!
You just have to see them again.
Mr. President. Will the senator yield for a question?
Will Senator Smith yield to his colleague?
Yes, I yield for a question.
The senator has said he is speaking to the people of his state.
He has been waiting, as he so fancifully puts it for them to come marching here in droves.
Would the gentlemen be interested in what those people have to say?
Here it comes.
Yes, sir, you bet I would.
Mr. President.
Have I permission to bring in evidence of the response of my state?
Is there objection?
You may proceed, senator.
Pageboys!
Come on, boys, on your feet.
I can't stand it. I can't stand to see him hurt like this.
Public opinion made to order.
Taylor-made.
There it is. There's the gentleman's answer.
Telegrams. 50,000 of them demanding that he yield this floor.
I invite the Senate to read them.
I invite my colleague to read them.
The people's answer to Mr. Jefferson Smith.
Stop, Jeff! Stop!
I guess this is just another lost cause, Mr. Paine.
All you people don't know about lost causes.
Mr. Paine does.
He said once they were the only causes worth fighting for.
He fought for them once.
For the only reason that any man ever fights for them.
Because of just one plain, simple rule:
Love thy neighbor.
In this world today full of hatred a man who knows that one rule has a great trust.
You know that rule, Mr. Paine.
And I loved you for it, just as my father did.
And you know you fight for lost causes harder than for any others.
Yes, you even die for them.
Like a man we both knew, Mr. Paine.
You think I'm licked.
You all think I'm licked!
Well, I'm not licked!
I'm going to stay right here and fight for this lost cause!
Even if this room gets filled with lies like these and the Taylors and all their armies come marching into this place.
Somebody will listen to me.
Oh, Jeff!
He's okay. He just fainted.
Okay.
Let me go!
What's the matter, Joe?
I'm not fit to be a senator!
I'm not fit to live!
Expel me!
Expel me, not him!
Willy Taylor's a fraud! It's a crime against the people who sent me here.
I committed it! Every word that boy said is the truth!
Every word about Taylor and me and graft and the rotten political corruption in my state!
Every word of it is true! I'm not fit for office!
I'm not fit for any place of honor or trust!
Expel me, not that boy!
We did it! We did it!
Order gentlemen! Please!
He did it! - Let go of me!

THE RULES OF THE GAME
This entertainment, set on the eve of the Second World War, does not claim to be a study of manners.
Its characters are purely fictitious."
Sensitive hearts, faithful hearts Who shun love whither it does range
Cease to be so bitter Is it a crime to change?
If Cupid was given wings Was it not to flitter?"
You're listening to Radio-Cité. It's exactly 10:00 p.m.
We're here at Le Bourget airfield, working our way through the crowd that's turned out to welcome the famous aviator André Jurieux, who has just performed a tremendous feat:
crossing the Atlantic in 23 hours!
A record comparable... Watch the cord!
A record comparable only to the one set a dozen years ago by Charles Lindbergh.
The crowd's moving!
Jurieux has arrived safe and sound, executing a magnificent landing.
The crowd is invading the airfield and crashing the police cordon.
The minister couldn't make it, but he asked me to convey his admiration and sincerest congratulations.
It's really the plane's doing.
Not at all.
It's a fine achievement.
Octave!
André! Am I ever happy!
Not about your flight!
It's you I'm glad to see! It is you, isn't it?
Is she here?
She didn't come?
She didn't come?
She couldn't make it.
But I did this all for her!
I know.
Mr. André Jurieux, a few words for our listeners.
Just a few words. - What can I say?
You just flew solo over the Atlantic.
You must have something to say.
Anything. You must be happy.
I'm very unhappy.
I've never been so disappointed in my life.
I made this flight for a woman.
She's not here to welcome me.
She didn't even bother.
I tell her this publicly: She's disloyal!
The great aviator has performed a stunning feat.
But remember, it's cost him a great deal of effort, and he's exhausted.
My purse, Lisette.
He can't really talk.
But we have here with us an engineer from Caudron.
Jurieux's aircraft was manufactured by Caudron.
It's a standard model with a 200-horsepower Renault engine.
The copilot's seat was replaced by an extra fuel tank.
You're a hero, but you just behaved like a spoiled kid.
If Christine won't see you, serves you right.
I couldn't face her now.
Get some sleep first.
Tell me, Lisette, how long have you been married?
Almost two years, Madame.
That's true.
How time flies! Are you happy?
My husband's no trouble.
He's in service at the château and I'm in Paris.
With you, Madame, I'm very happy.
Do you have lovers?
That's a big word.
Of course you do.
Octave, for example.
Give me my evening lipstick.
I don't know where it is.
Oh, yes, you do.
I don't like it. Too purple.
It doesn't look natural.
What's natural nowadays?
And your lovers... What do they say to you?
Not much.
Do they kiss you?
If I let them.
Do they hold your hand?
It depends.
And then what? - Then what?
Same old story: The more you give, the more they want.
My scarf.
Nothing doing. Men are all the same.
What about friendship?
Friendship with a man?
When pigs have wings!
Good evening, Madame.
Good evening, Lisette.
Mitzi...
Yes, Madame?
Did you take the dogs out?
Yes, Madame.
Where is Monsieur?
In his study.
Calm has returned to Le Bourget airfield.
The crowd is breaking up peacefully.
The victory reception is over.
We've just witnessed an event that will go down...
We're late, my dear.
As usual.
A new one? - I got it today.
It's a romantic Negress. In perfect working order.
I prefer it to the radio.
So, you heard what André Jurieux said?
I can well imagine what he thought. He'd risked his life.
How could you have refused him that small token of affection he must have pleaded for so touchingly?
He mistook it for love.
Men are so naïve.
How happy that makes me!
Thank you. - It's nothing.
Telling lies is such a heavy weight to bear.
Lies...
Don't exaggerate.
Would you call me a liar?
I trust you completely.
Do you?
Excuse me a minute, my dear.
Madame de Marras, please.
Is that you, Geneviève?
I must see you.
Then come over now.
You're going out with Christine?
In the morning, then.
Not at 10:00. Yes, 11 :00. Be realistic.
La Chesnaye must be in a state.
So why does he have a wireless?
Progress.
You call that progress?
I call it exhibitionism.
I feel sorry for Christine, because she's a foreigner.
And because you have a crush on her.
No, but it must be hard to leave the life she had in Austria.
An artist's life. Her father was a famous conductor in Vienna.
And to move to Paris where nobody speaks her language.
Why did she marry? I didn't! - Oh, you!
What's on your mind?
A maxim by Chamfort. It could almost be a precept.
What does he say?
Love as it exists in society is merely the mingling of two whims and the contact of two skins."
If I understand you right, you want to leave me.
Last night I suddenly decided to be worthy of my wife.
I see the family picture: knitting, the slippers and lots of children.
Exactly. I sort of feel now that I've had my fun.
All this because of the radio and André Jurieux.
How perceptive you are!
Let's say we do split up.
What would change with Christine?
Why, everything.
Nothing! She's remained so Austrian.
A Parisian woman would understand. Not her.
If she found out, it's not our affair she'd hold against you, but the fact that you lied from the start.
She'd never forgive you.
I know.
Believe it or not, you mean a lot to me.
I don't know if it's love or force of habit, but if you leave me, I'll be very unhappy, and I don't want to be.
My dear, I'm so sorry.
I didn't intend to hurt you, but put yourself in my shoes.
A good thing you're weak.
I take after my father.
The poor man had such a complicated existence.
Let's go to lunch.
With pleasure.
I don't know if it's this sentimental talk, but I'm famished!
No, old man! Go on if you want, but I'm walking home.
Don't leave me alone.
Damn your problems!
Since you got back, you haven't stopped bending my ear.
And now you drive us into a ditch.
Thanks, but no thanks!
Are you hurt?
I wonder if I'm not dead. I hit the roof like a feather.
It's rattled my brains.
Want to kill yourself over Christine? Go ahead, but without me.
Understand...
I do. You're nuts!
So I'm nuts!
Get help and get off my back.
You'd gladly see me put away.
You love her, too.
Sure I do, in my own way.
So you can't have her like a glass of wine.
Get this: She's like a sister to me.
We grew up together.
Her father, old Stiller, wasn't just the greatest of conductors.
He was also the best of men.
When I went to study music with him in Salzburg, he treated me like a son.
I never got to show him my gratitude.
Now I can. He's not here to look after his daughter anymore.
So I can and will look after her. She needs looking after.
She's a foreigner among people who don't speak her language.
If you want to make her happy, let her come with me.
Because I love her.
Seeing her with that idiot La Chesnaye!
Him and his hunts, château and mechanical birds! A two-timing snob!
He may be a snob, but he's got his feet on the ground.
Your head's in the clouds.
You put your foot in your mouth, like on the radio.
At Le Bourget when you got back.
You're back from America after breaking all sorts of records.
You get a hero's welcome. Ministers make speeches.
But instead of modestly and calmly playing your part as a national hero, instead of giving radio audiences the twaddle they expect, you start sounding off about Christine.
No wonder she won't see you!
But I did it for her, for her alone, understand?
She encouraged me. So when she didn't show up...
She's a society woman, and society has strict rules.
I don't need lectures.
I need Christine.
I love her, you know.
If I don't see her again, I'll die.
You'll see her again.
Think so?
Sure you will.
Leave it to me.
So, Mr. Octave!
No hello?
Fresh as a rose.
But you look awful. What's the matter?
I bet it's your pilot friend again.
What a nuisance! Madame can't sleep at night.
Listen here. Do you trust me?
I'll settle it.
Really?
Where have you been?
I've been very busy.
Problems?
I'll tell you later.
You came to see my wife? Let me say good morning.
What's that you got: a nightingale?
A warbler.
Looks like the moths got to it.
But it still sings every 20 seconds.
I bet it does.
Cynic.
Where have you been all this time?
Were you away?
May I?
Good morning, my dear.
Sleep well?
Say, Lisette.
I got a letter from Shoemaker.
Schumacher!
Your husband.
He says that without her, my woods lack poetry, and his gamekeeper's job seems utterly dreary.
He wants you to join him.
And leave Madame?
Your lordship, I'd rather divorce.
Don't get melodramatic.
Are you two done talking?
Oh, yes, you have a big secret for her.
You said it.
I'll leave you.
About time, too.
Coming out to "La Colinière"?
Maybe.
What did I say? Twenty seconds.
A cup of tea?
A nice hot coffee with bread and jam?
I'm not hungry.
Something's definitely out of order.
I've never seen Mr. Octave without an appetite.
Won't you sit down?
Come now, tell me your secret.
It's about André.
Oh, no!
You know he wanted to die?
That's just talk.
Excuse me, but I was there.
How could he?
How? Why, in his car. He tried to drive into a tree.
And it's my fault?
It sure is your fault.
I don't understand. - Don't you?
Listen, my dear.
You throw yourself around people's necks like a 12-year-old.
You can do it with me.
You'll always be my little Salzburg girl.
But with others it can be... awkward.
So, in Paris, you can't show a man affection without...
So I'm to blame for everything?
Not everything. Just a few things.
Must I apologize to your friend?
That's going a bit far. But you might...
invite him to "La Colinière."
You're so improper!
In that case... I'm going. Good-bye.
Where are you going?
To see him.
You won't come out to "La Colinière"?
I can't cut myself in two.
You silly thing! You foolish old dear!
So you'll invite him?
I'll invite him.
I don't want to be the woman who drove to despair the great hero, the idol of the masses.
If his plane crashes, they'll blame it on me.
They'll call me a vamp, public enemy, obstacle to progress.
They'll talk about "the foreigner."
And I hate martyrs.
And your husband... what'll you do about him?
That's your business.
I've done my part. I wash my hands of the rest.
Christine, du bist ein Engel. - An angel?
A dangerous angel, but an angel nonetheless.
Cook me up two fried eggs, a big slice of ham and a glass of white wine.
You'll put on weight. - Don't worry. I'll deal with it.
All right, then.
I'll expect you at "La Colinière."
You have your own car, fine.
See you tomorrow.
I'm in a terrible predicament.
Geneviève.
You know?
Who doesn't? Sick and tired of her?
But you want to end it? Leave it to me.
If you could.
Easy enough. She's dying to get married, so we'll get her hitched.
To whom?
To you?
Oh, me, you know, I'm not the marrying kind.
I'd be ready to sacrifice myself.
But only for Christine.
I know.
But I need a favor in return.
You need money?
You know you're a decent guy?
I take after my mother.
I want you to invite André Jurieux.
To "La Colinière"?
That's a very serious request.
Serious?
I know what happened between Christine and your friend.
I'm not blind.
Nothing happened.
A good thing, too!
Then invite him.
I'd be taking a big risk. I love Christine.
I'd never get over losing her.
You know what? I feel like skedaddling.
I want to disappear down a hole.
What for?
So as not to have to figure out what's right and what's wrong.
The awful thing about life is this: Everyone has their reasons.
Of course they do.
And I'm all for their free expression.
I'm against barriers and walls.
And that's why I'll invite André.
Is it the right thing to do?
I have faith in Christine.
If she loves Jurieux, separating them won't stop her.
They might as well see each other and talk it over.
You know, we could get Geneviève together with André.
You idiot! That would be way too practical.
I'll get dressed. Staying for breakfast?
Yes, I'm staying.
Your lordship, about "La Colinière"... See my secretary.
Is Madame bringing her dogs?
Ask Madame.
My screw!
Move this bench away.
It's the screw for my warbler. - I understand, sir.
My dear, put that on the table.
I have some big news.
My pilot," as you call him, will be with me at "La Colinière."
The things you dream up!
The things I dream up?
Excuse me! You know, you're no fool, you're a poet.
A dangerous poet.
Your lordship.
Excuse me for bringing this up while on duty.
It's about my wife.
You wrote me, my friend.
With my wife in Paris and me out here, it's hardly a life.
I feel like a widower. What did his lordship decide?
What's there to decide?
If your wife wants to be with you, it's her decision.
I'm so glad to be here. - So am I.
I lit the stove and stocked all the fireplaces.
Inform Corneille.
How is Gertrude?
Just fine, your ladyship.
Was the coal delivered?
And the wood brought in?
Very good.
Hello, Lisette. - Hello, Edouard.
Everything all right?
Here you are, at last.
Yes, here I am.
What's that?
It's Mr. des Réaux's people. They're shooting rabbits.
What keeps you from doing the same?
We've already put up fences at Epinereaux and Tixier.
Along with what the gamekeepers ferreted, we've killed about 250.
Is that all?
With the full moon, we kill fewer than usual.
We need to put up wire fencing to protect the plantation.
I don't want any fencing. - Yes, your lordship.
Nor do I want any rabbits. Work it out.
May I continue my rounds?
Of course, Schumacher.
We'll head towards Foucherolle.
Musette! Here, girl!
What did the boss say?
He doesn't want fencing or rabbits.
How are we supposed to work it out?
It's that pest of a miller's cat.
He's a real nuisance.
He's no nuisance now.
Marceau deserves the same treatment.
Marceau takes us for idiots.
But it won't last much longer.
What'd you find, girl?
A rabbit in a snare.
Marceau sets snares all over. Leave them. Don't tip him off.
He won't be by today.
At dawn?
If he goes on a binge, he won't be up early.
That bum's got it too easy. What do we do?
Watch out for him.
There's one!
Hello, Marceau.
Hello, Schumacher.
How are you?
Want my rabbit?
Give it here.
Go on, walk.
Get a move on!
What's going on?
Marceau, your lordship.
Marceau who?
Marceau the poacher.
Come here.
We caught him red-handed.
Doing what?
Setting snares at woods' edge.
To destroy rabbits?
Why, the man's valuable! Let him go!
Is his lordship serious? - He understands me.
He's an intelligent guy, not like this big bully!
Bully? I'll teach you manners.
Scum like you should be shot.
Just for a tiny little rabbit!
So your name is Marceau?
Yes, your lordship.
You're a poacher?
Actually, I mend chairs.
But times are tough even in my line. His lordship understands me.
So I try to keep busy. - Call that busy?
Back in the war, I had men shot for less.
That's enough.
I like your face.
His lordship's kind.
He's riffraff!
Enough.
Rather than work as an amateur, would you like to kill rabbits for me?
His lordship wants to hire me?
I won't say no. If I poach, it's not out of spite.
It's to feed my aging mother.
He has none!
What?
I don't have an aging mother?
Continue your rounds.
Leave me alone.
Say, Marceau.
You must have set other snares. Will you show me one?
Being in your lordship's service now, I can't refuse.
This way.
Over here, your lordship. Here's a snare. It's set in the wrong place.
This trail isn't used anymore. I should've noticed.
We all make mistakes.
No, it's annoying.
If Schumacher saw this, I'd never hear the last of it.
You can count on my discretion.
Thanks, your lordship.
So, glad to be working for me?
Sure, but I'd rather work at the château.
Why?
Don't you like the woods, Mother Nature?
With Schumacher around, not really.
This is more his world than yours.
At the château, he'd have to leave me alone.
I always dreamed of being a domestic.
That's funny. Why?
Because of the outfit.
I've always dreamed of wearing a uniform.
Has it been raining long?
A half hour. It was sunny at noon.
Will it last?
Last time it rained for two weeks.
Charming!
Her luggage.
Every time I come out here it rains.
It clears out the mind.
Hello, La Bruyère.
Will you allow me?
You're drenched.
Your scarf.
Where's your wife?
With Christine, discussing housekeeping.
How interesting. You came from Tourcoing?
Is it raining there?
Like everywhere else.
It took eight hours to get here via Paris. The roads are slippery.
A record. Hello, Jackie.
How you've grown! - Think so?
You're studying Chinese, right?
No, pre-Columbian art.
Sounds thrilling!
How are you, Charlotte? - Hello, my dear.
Have you lost weight?
Watch out for yourself. - I swear.
What about these? You can't fool me.
Are you playing?
I'll be right in.
Will you join us?
Bridge bores me.
Who mentioned bridge?
It's belote!
Who does your hair, Geneviève?
Did you really invite Jurieux?
I did. Do you mind?
On the contrary.
Isn't Jean here?
He drove to Orleans for the fish.
Tell him about Madame La Bruyère's diet.
She eats everything. But no salt.
On the contrary. But only sea salt. And only once the food's cooked.
It's simple. Even a child would understand.
Do you have sea salt?
No, but we'll see to it.
Adolphe, for Madame La Plante...
I almost forgot: no tea, just coffee.
And for the general, a slice of lemon in hot water.
I know: arthritis.
And for André Jurieux?
What do you think of the diphtheria vaccine?
I don't know.
At the factory dispensary, we've had very good results.
Really?
Find your suitcase?
My eldest had strep throat and the youngest, measles.
You can imagine how worried I...
Who's that?
André Jurieux.
The aviator?
What luck! I'll ask him for an autograph for my eldest boy.
So nice of you to come.
You're very kind.
My dear André. This is a pleasure. It's an honor to have you.
You haven't met my wife.
She'd like an autograph for our eldest boy.
I hope we'll see you in Tourcoing.
You were magnificent.
My dear Jurieux, I'm proud to shake your hand.
Very proud. You're a man, a real man.
It's a vanishing breed.
You didn't fly in? I must kiss you.
Glad to see you here.
May I kiss you, too?
And me?
I'm entitled to.
It stays in the family.
What's that supposed to mean?
Jurieux and Christine.
What's it to you?
We're here to hunt, not to write our memoirs.
So, did they or didn't they?
They did.
A pity. He's so elegant.
Dear friends,
I must confess something regarding my relationship with André Jurieux.
I had a small part to play in his exploit.
This is how...
While preparing for his flight, André came to see me often.
We spent long hours together. Very pleasant hours.
Hours marked by the rare sign of friendship.
He told me about his projects and I listened.
It's important to listen.
In this case, it wasn't a waste of time.
I'm very proud, and I wanted you all to know it.
Aunt, I'm so happy.
We'll throw a big party for Jurieux. - Excellent idea.
We'll put on a show. We'll masquerade!
Sure, we'll masquerade!
We'll have as much fun as we can.
When, General?
A week from now, after the hunt.
Perfect!
Christine, let's show him his room.
These young people are charming.
Saint-Aubin, some billiards - Yes, sir.
Anyone for a game of ping-pong? - Me.
Coming, Geneviève?
A party for what?
To raise funds for the dispensary.
Your coat, madam.
I'll take it off in my room.
That Mr. Jurieux is charming.
He must have a good position.
Most likely.
A perfect match for you, Jackie.
André doesn't notice I exist.
I could arrange a little get-together at my home in Tourcoing.
This Jurieux's handsome. A pity the lady of the house...
Did you know she seated him at her right?
What right?
At the table.
That's bad. I'm all for doing as I like, but etiquette is etiquette.
Madame can do without your advice.
Asparagus?
Never anything canned.
Only fresh foods, for the vitamins.
Pass the mustard?
Did you get sea salt for La Bruyère?
She can eat like everybody else.
Diets I can accept, but not obsessions.
Madame's gone too far over her aviator.
Constraint spoils pleasure."
And you, Mr. Corneille?
None of your business.
That's not very nice.
Pass the mustard.
Corneille, you spent 10 years with Count de Vaudois...
Twelve. I'd still be there if he hadn't gone bankrupt.
Fine, but did the countess...
She had no lovers.
Of course not. She was 85 years old and confined to a wheelchair.
You can't compare her to Madame.
The count wasn't a yid.
Meaning what?
Only that La Chesnaye's grandfather was a Rosenthal from Frankfurt.
I'm sure your husband agrees.
Right, Schumacher?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Speaking of Jews, I used to work for the Baron d'Epinay.
There were no Jews there, but I can tell you they ate like pigs.
Will you be long, Lisette?
Madame still needs me.
La Chesnaye, yid as he may be, chewed me out recently over a potato salad.
You know – or maybe you don't – that for it to be any good, you pour white wine over the potatoes when they're boiling hot.
But Célestin was afraid of getting burned.
Well, the boss sensed right off he hadn't done it.
Say what you like, but that's what I call a real gentleman.
So there you are.
Who do we have here?
I'm looking for Mr. Corneille.
Yes, my friend?
I'm the new domestic. His lordship must have told you.
What do you do, my good man?
Oh, I dunno... a bit of everything.
You shine shoes, my good man? - Oh, sure.
When it comes to cleaning, I'm what you call a specialist.
Tomorrow morning you'll collect the boots outside the guest rooms.
Will do, Mr. Corneille.
We eat here? - Yes, my good man.
I'm on duty now.
Sit down here.
Germaine, a plate.
What's your name?
Marceau. And you, mademoiselle?
Madame. My name's Lisette. I'm Madame Schumacher.
Don't let that stop you from sitting down.
The game better be good.
Last year, at the Cahens, we only bagged 60 pheasant the first day.
So long as I don't eat rabbit, I don't care!
Anything but wild rabbit!
Do I serve rabbit other than paté?
I'm not saying you do.
Say, La Chesnaye, enjoy driving your Delahaye?
Last month, Cannes-Paris: 10 hours and 35 minutes.
With a lunch stop.
So it's all set. A party after the hunt.
What party? - Our party!
A masquerade?
Of course. Off to bed now.
I'll come check you have everything you need.
As your guests, we never lack for anything.
Such hospitality is dying out.
Christine, you're the perfect hostess. This way, General.
Before you go, I was meaning to ask you... What's this pre-Columbian art? What are you studying?
American civilization before Columbus's arrival.
Oh, Negroes!
There weren't any Negroes yet.
Who was there?
The Indians.
What a goose I am! Buffalo Bill!
I forget where my room is.
I'll show you.
We must have a splendid view. Too bad it's dark.
A hunting horn! You hunt on horseback?
In my father's day.
Is Octave too noisy? - Not at all.
At the party, I'll do a fencing demonstration.
I used to do a card trick.
Whatever you do will be fine.
You're a great musician.
Have fun.
William, I won't be needing you tonight.
Good night.
Sleep well.
Good night. Sleep well.
You two happy? - Very.
I adore you, Charlotte!
My dear, I'm so grateful to you.
For what?
For not making me look foolish.
It was delicate, in front of everyone.
Jurieux handled it well too.
It was a trying moment, and you were admirable. My compliments.
You can go now. I won't be needing you now.
Oh, no? Good night, Madame.
Don't you want children?
Sure I do, Madame. But they demand a lot of time.
You have to keep after them. Or else why bother?
That's the beauty of it. It's your sole preoccupation.
Madame's heard about the new servant?
He's very nice.
His name's Marceau.
Watch out for your husband. His name's Schumacher.
And Mr. Octave's friend's name is André Jurieux.
So my aviator's not all that bad.
You sure smell nice. Perfume?
Leave me alone!
Something's cooking!
Not in bed yet?
So that's it.
That's what?
It's working out. Happy?
Delighted. Now we can put our cards on the table.
But you'd better hide your hand.
My good man, I hadn't heard about that radio business.
It confirms my opinion that our little Christine has class.
And that's a rare thing nowadays.
Sleep well, General.
What do you say?
About what?
Everything. It's going well.
I'm getting the hell out.
Oh, no, not after all the trouble I went to.
You're here, you stay.
Do you like pillows?
I can't stand 'em.
You finished bouncing around?
Sorry, Saint-Aubin. I shouldn't have shot that pheasant. I thought it was in my range, but it was yours.
No, it was clearly yours.
No, it was past the pine tree.
It was yours, my dear fellow.
You're too kind.
You'll have the seventh blind.
It's a bit far, but there are plenty of pheasant.
Saint-Aubin, you're his neighbor.
The beaters come from where?
From there.
Then the game will come this way.
At least we'll be upwind.
Schumacher will show you to your blinds.
Madame de Marras? - I know where.
Mr. Jurieux, you can go up that way.
You have to get some height ahead of the beaters.
A lot of game try to escape over the road.
You coming with me?
There?
They'll take us for rabbits.
Don't be silly.
That's right, the last blind.
Happy being out here?
Very happy. And far from the chatterers.
Say, Octave... did you see Christine with La Chesnaye?
What'd they do now?
Disgusting!
They're overdoing it.
They have every right to. They're married.
I hate her.
You're going through a rough time, but you'll get over it.
Trust my experience. It'll take a while, but you will.
One morning you'll wake up and you'll notice the concierge's daughter has gorgeous eyes.
There, you're cured.
To wake up I have to fall asleep.
So I've noticed. You can really be a pain at night.
Ready on the left?
Let's go.
Gentlemen, your positions!
Move it on the left.
Move ahead.
Stay close.
Flush 'em out.
Jackie, do you enjoy hunting?
Yes, Aunt. Don't you?
I missed them all. I'm a poor shot today.
You two were talking too much.
Anyway, I'm sick of hunting.
Simple enough. We'll take up winter sports.
Shall we display the kill?
No.
Do that at the château.
That pheasant there on the left...
Sorry, sir, but this time it's mine.
You can't keep pulling this.
Last time I didn't complain.
Try to understand. I get a bead on a pheasant, and bang!
He shoots it down in front of me!
That's a bit rich!
They have a fine sport in Austria: hunting woodcock.
At night?
At dawn.
I have something to tell you.
Go ahead.
It's a secret. May I borrow him, General?
If you give him back.
Have no fear.
None of that, Saint-Aubin.
Some people are really clumsy with their guns.
Know what happened to poor George last year at the Malvoisies?
He took his gun from his loader in such a way that he blasted his thigh to pieces.
He was dead in 20 minutes.
Wasn't that a good one, Christine?
Deyeux said, "Your day is done with game bag full and empty gun."
Jackie, it's yours! - Where?
I can't see a thing!
But where? - There! Aim at the rabbit, not me.
We lost him.
You're the most deliciously clumsy of women.
Am I?
You are.
I wish I were even clumsier.
Why? - So you'd kiss me more often.
Easy enough.
You know, Jackie... I don't love you.
I know. But you're wasting your time with my aunt.
So you know.
It's no joke. You're in pain and so am I.
The field master was lousy.
Mr. André shot poorly.
His lordship is a better shot.
You finished, kids?
I had no luck despite my position.
It can happen.
Are you cold, Madame?
Not when I walk.
When the sun goes down, the temperatures plummet.
A squirrel!
If I only had my gun....
Why?
I'm fond of squirrels.
They're charming but destructive.
Take a look.
How marvelous! It looks so close I could almost touch it.
Field glasses always come in handy.
This one's small enough to carry.
Their lenses are so fine and their shape so practical that at a short distance you can watch that squirrel up close without frightening it.
Fine. So you'll tell Christine everything.
To what end?
To hurt you.
Charming of you!
I hate suffering alone. Misery loves company.
I want to see your face when Christine leaves you.
And she will if I tell her.
I don't doubt it.
You really love her.
You've stopped loving me?
Let's change the subject.
I'm like the shepherd Paris without the apple. It's grotesque.
Please give me an answer.
No, I don't love you anymore. I'm very fond of you, but...
But I bore you.
The words you come up with, my dear.
The right ones.
I give up.
You can fight hatred, but not boredom.
Well, the whole thing's getting to me, too.
Seeing you play shepherd to your Viennese shepherdess makes me want to yawn.
I'm leaving.
That would be best.
Yes, I'm leaving. But bid me a tender farewell.
Not farewell. Good-bye.
No, farewell. But a beautiful farewell.
For a moment, I want to go back three years in time.
When Christine didn't exist.
Take me in your arms as you did then.
I'll close my eyes and believe in everything I could desire.
Come now, Geneviève.
Don't say a thing.
Kiss me.
My dear...
Extraordinary!
A moorhen! You could count its feathers.
Still see it?
Here, Madame.
Two feet away from the tree.
I want to see it, too.
Isn't it sweet!
Let me see. It's my turn.
Whatever you're looking at seems damn interesting.
Very interesting.
'Morning, your ladyship.
You're leaving? - Yes, I am.
Not staying for our party?
I'm expected in Paris.
You can phone.
No, it's better if I go.
Better?
For whom?
For you?
For me, then?
My dear Geneviève, can we speak frankly?
Am I a troublesome wife?
How could you be troublesome to me?
Have I ever tried to hinder your relationship with my husband?
You know?
Like everyone else.
Good old Robert. He's so kind, so sensitive.
But he's like a child. He's incapable of hiding a thing.
How true.
When he tries to lie, you can tell right away.
He blushes before speaking.
His nose almost starts growing.
He has such tact.
I only have one complaint: his habit of smoking in bed.
Isn't it awful, though! And the ashes!
The sheets!
All burnt!
The holes! - As if beds were for smoking!
I ask you.
So you'll stay?
I don't know anymore.
Women should help each other out once in a while.
If you stay, my husband will look after you and a little less after me, which would suit me fine right now.
André Jurieux?
André's very kind and very decent, but too sincere.
It depends what for.
What will you wear tonight?
A Tyrolian outfit.
And you?
I didn't prepare anything.
Come with me.
We'll find some fabric.
Do you know any Tyrolian dances?
Wait, it must go like this.
No, like this.
Unbelievable!
Our shoes have vanished.
My boots are missing. - So are mine.
My wife's shoes are gone.
Corneille will find them.
I'll see to it.
What will you wear tonight?
I thought it over all night. I'm going to dress as a bear.
Wait. I left the price tag on.
It's a fine cape.
Warm and waterproof.
But it's not flattering.
Some men require not reputation's yoke.
Their first sword's thrust can be the master stroke.
The eye was in the grave and was watching Cain."
Getting used to your new job?
She loves me.
Loves me not.
Loves me.
Loves me not.
Loves me.
Loves me not.
Loves me.
Loves me not.
Loves me.
She loves me.
I hurt you.
On the contrary. I'm glad.
Why?
You're close to me. - Silly.
Leave us alone or I'll tell Madame and you'll be fired!
What are you doing here?
I'm on duty.
We're on duty.
The boots, my good man!
All the men are waiting. There's a house revolution!
Don't blame me. Blame this big bully here.
Why are you here?
I came to see my wife.
This is hardly the moment. Their party's tonight. Off you go.
I catch you with her again, I'll fill you full of lead!
Stop bothering the staff. We're busy enough as it is.
See? You're bothering the staff.
We're a hit.
Encore.
She's so annoying! Come on...
Author!
Feeling gay we proudly made our way
Out to the racetrack our hearts unafraid
Our step was brisk We couldn't risk
Missing the military parade
All together now!
Where'd she go?
We must talk!
Where is she? - Who?
Christine. - Dunno. Help me out of this.
Berthelin. - Don't bother me now.
I drank too much. I don't know what I'm doing.
That's good.
Aren't we playing anymore?
I've had enough of this show.
Why'd I dress up like this, then?
Help me out of this bearskin.
We're busy.
Busy!
Help me out of this. - I'm busy.
Have you seen my wife?
I'm looking for her.
For Christ's sake, who'll help me out of this skin?
I'm dying to play belote. - A two-hander?
Ask the general.
Have you seen Madame?
I don't mean to be a nuisance, but I can't manage.
You're a nice fellow, but...
But I can't take it off by myself!
Now's not the time.
And Christine? What've you done with her?
You'll find out soon enough.
Let me just get this off. Then they'll see!
Come here. I'll take your bearskin off.
About time!
If she still loved you, she wouldn't be with Saint-Aubin.
Let's leave together.
I live here. I can't just walk out.
You and your sense of property!
As if a house were that important!
I must see Christine first.
Pull!
You haven't seen me. - Why?
Schumacher's after me.
What for?
On account of his wife.
We were playing around. He saw us and he's not happy.
Oh, your lordship... women are charming. I like them a lot.
Too much, in fact. But they spell trouble.
You're telling me.
You've got it bad, too?
Somewhat.
Ever wish you were an Arab?
No. What for?
For the harem.
Only Muslims show a little logic in matters of male-female relations.
They're made like us. - If you say so.
They always have a favorite.
But they don't kick the others out and hurt their feelings.
I don't want to hurt anyone, especially not a woman.
It's the story of my life.
But that takes money.
Even with money, I still hurt everybody:
my wife, my mistress and even myself.
Whether it's to have a woman, leave her or hold on to her, first I make her laugh.
That way, her guard's down and you have your way with her.
Why don't you give it a try?
Because it takes talent.
Naturally.
Would you mind doing me a favor?
Gladly. What?
Check if the coast is clear.
If Schumacher's not at this end, I'll slip out the kitchen.
Use the terrace.
Too much light.
Stay here. I'll take a look.
Thanks, your lordship.
What are you doing here?
Nothing.
You're restricted to the hallways tonight.
Move into my bathroom!
You're needed.
Is it time? - Just about.
Where's Mr. Saint-Aubin?
I don't know, honestly.
Excuse me!
Where's André?
You realize I've been looking for you for the past half hour?
By what right?
Yes, by what right?
You're being indiscreet.
Maybe so, but this time I demand an explanation.
I refuse to give one.
You can't order Christine around.
Then you'll give me one.
I'll box your ears, sir.
Just try, sir.
André, please!
My dear Christine, I'm sorry. He'll receive my seconds in the morning.
Mornings, I sleep. I may have to throw them out.
You won't duel?
Not with you.
You won't live it down.
That's a laugh.
In my opinion, you're a most contemptible coward.
You're putting me in an inferior position.
You mustn't fight.
I'm going to break that clown's neck.
Stay out of this.
So I'm a coward?
See to Saint-Aubin.
Why weren't you at Le Bourget?
Because... I love you, André.
I never wanted to admit it.
But now I have a right to tell you. I love you.
This is wonderful.
I'd given up hope.
What are we going to do?
We'll go away.
Where?
Anywhere.
When?
Right away.
I love you, Christine.
I think I can make you happy.
I've dreamed only of the joy of being with you.
So I know... this joy doesn't come as a surprise.
Are you afraid?
I must tell La Chesnaye.
What for?
It's only proper that I do.
Listen to me.
I can't run off with the wife of a host who calls me friend and shakes my hand without an explanation.
But since we're in love, what difference can it make?
Even so, Christine, there are still rules.
Dear friends, I have the pleasure of showing you my latest acquisition.
It's the high point of my career as a collector of musical and mechanical instruments.
I think you'll like it. I'll let you decide.
One...
Two...
Music!
If he bothers you, come and get me.
I'll put him in his place, and fast.
What are you doing here?
I came down for an apple.
Where's Marceau?
Am I his keeper?
Where you going?
Upstairs with the others.
Get me a drink.
I'm leaving tomorrow, and you're coming with me.
Whatever you say, Edouard.
I'll take you to Alsace.
Poachers, crooks, the likes of Marceau we know how to handle.
A squeeze of the trigger one night in the woods, and that's settled.
Of course.
To hell with their money.
It's stupid to work for others when you can be your own master.
And Alsace must be so beautiful, with all those tall fir trees, all that snow, and the storks.
Stop it! Do you hear me?
Let go!
Let go, Lisette!
For the last time!
Do you hear me? I won't say it again!
No, André, I'll leave with you right now or never.
We must walk out with our heads high.
You'll thank me later.
Sorry, Madame.
I'll murder you!
Well, now...
Mr. Jurieux.
You have what you wanted.
You're stealing my wife.
No, just give me five minutes.
I'll give you this, bastard!
Repeat that?
What's going on?
Let's get out of here.
Hold on!
Thief!
Are you crazy?
I've had enough!
What is it?
I just told your friend that I love him.
Well, it's about time!
You really love him?
I don't know anymore.
Already? What'd he do to you?
He kept talking... about propriety.
He suggested that I spend a month with his mother in the country while he settled things with La Chesnaye.
What did you expect?
That he'd take me in his arms, kiss me and take me away.
Poor little Christine.
There's one thing you forget: You see, he's a hero.
I'll have his hide!
You're crazy!
I've had it! I'll break your neck!
Was that a bullet?
A bullet.
From a gun. A bullet from a gun. Does that surprise you?
Christine disappeared.
Christine disappeared! Tonight... Christine disappeared!
You fools!
Didn't you see her leave with Octave?
I don't blame her. If you two think you're any fun!
Don't worry. You'll find her someday.
And now, darling, let's talk about the two of us.
When are we leaving?
This isn't the moment!
I have other worries!
Your father walked by without even a look.
And we hid behind a door.
The musicians were already on their feet.
And out there, the audience was applauding.
The old atmosphere!
Sure was.
The setting was strange.
It was meant to look like a parlor in green and gold.
The kind of green only the English can come up with.
And your father... what elegance!
He crossed the stage, oblivious to everything.
The house went wild.
The king here... As hard as he could.
He took his baton from the first violin.
As usual.
And just like in a dream...
You dirty louse!
Let go! Not another attraction?
This is too much.
Enough is enough.
I hate gunshots.
That will do, Schumacher!
Get off my back!
André, please help me calm her down.
Corneille, put an end to this farce!
Which one, your lordship?
Schumacher and company!
Right away.
You were standing here?
Yes, Madame.
And I have to thank you.
Thank you. - Don't mention it!
What's the dose?
Two.
Give me four.
Sleeping pills?
I hate sleeping pills!
Be reasonable.
Where are you going?
To dance!
You can dance in bed.
Yes, my love. I'm going to bed.
Yes, darling, I'm going to bed.
You really need it.
Go back to your room. I'm asking you, go back inside.
Calm down, my dear. We'll see each other tomorrow.
Good night.
The general!
Cigarette?
Turning in so soon, General?
Yes, I'm turning in.
I wanted to pay my respects to Christine.
Where is she?
A headache.
Turning in because of that incident?
Not at all.
A slight dispute.
Of course. Good night.
Where's Christine? Something must be wrong.
She was tired and turned in.
Really?
And Geneviève?
A bit weary, that's all.
She's so sensitive.
The staff was a bit excited tonight.
They're entitled to some fun, too.
We thought it was an act.
Had I known, I would have stopped him.
It's all right. Sleep well.
My respects to your wife.
Kiss her for me.
Going already?
It's early yet.
If Christine has the flu, try a footbath with mustard flour.
Can't we see Christine?
She's resting.
Great evening! This would have been impossible in Tourcoing.
We once danced a farandole. Charming, but so old-fashioned.
Of course.
Good night.
Just a minute.
Was there a lot of damage?
Was anyone injured?
I just did an inspection. None of the guests were hurt.
The stuffed birds suffered a bit, and I found a bullet in a door.
Not to mention the glassware.
I have no choice but to dismiss you.
It breaks my heart, but I can't expose my guests to your firearms.
It may be wrong of them, but they value their lives.
When must I leave?
Straightaway. At once.
Corneille will pay you some compensation.
I never want to hear your name again.
You're coming with me?
I'm going to Madame.
To say good-bye to her?
I told you before! If Madame still wants me, I'm staying.
Isn't it excessive?
Do as I say.
Very well.
Come with me.
My good man, I have to ask you to leave, too.
I can't dismiss Schumacher and leave you here with his wife.
It'd be immoral, you understand?
I understand. No hard feelings.
Before I go, I want to tell you how grateful I am.
You tried to help me up by making me a domestic. I'll never forget that.
Don't try to soften me up. Just go. I've enough troubles as it is.
What a night!
Where were we?
I asked you for five minutes.
Granted.
How good of you. But you have quite a right hook.
You're too kind.
Where can we talk?
In the dining room.
Yes, of course.
But first, accept my apologies. - You don't have to...
You must.
I behaved like a real roughneck.
I was no better.
Know what our little athletic display reminded me of?
I sometimes read articles in the papers about some Italian roadworker trying to seduce a Polish laborer's wife.
I never believed such things happened. But they do!
I have an excuse.
I love Christine.
And I don't?
I love her so much I want her to leave with you.
Since her happiness depends on it.
But I'm glad it's with someone from our set.
But still... something bothers me.
What?
Your profession.
What about it?
Christine has a certain lifestyle.
You're young and famous. You could have an accident.
What optimism!
One has to consider it.
What would your financial situation be?
What peace after all that noise.
Are they all gone?
Looks like it.
Good.
I must talk to you about André again.
You have to understand. It's the plight of all heroes today.
In the air, they're terrific.
But when they come back to earth, they're weak, poor and helpless.
Clumsy as children.
They can cross the Atlantic, but not the Champs-Elysées outside the crosswalk.
That's how they are.
Look at the moon with its halo. It will rain tomorrow.
I was looking for you. I was worried.
Why?
You're not mad at me?
Not at all.
It's not our fault if men are all mad.
So I can stay?
Of course.
I'm so happy!
Come inside. You can't be out like this on a November night.
You knew about Mme. de Marras and my husband?
But it began before your marriage. At a summer resort.
You see? Everybody knew. And you never said a word.
We didn't want to hurt you. - Obviously.
For the last three years, my life's been built on a lie.
It's been on my mind since I saw them at the hunt.
And suddenly I understood.
That's also part of the times.
Today everyone lies.
Pharmaceutical fliers, governments, the radio, the movies, the newspapers.
So why shouldn't simple people like us lie as well?
Let's go for a walk.
I'll get your coat.
I'm too warm.
That's because you're not well. Take my cape.
It's not very fancy, but you won't catch cold.
You up the creek?
So am I.
Did you see her again?
Me neither.
She said she'd stay with Madame.
With Madame!
She's not married to you, but to Madame.
What'll you do now?
I'll go back to my little cabin and get back to work.
Back to your poaching?
What's it to you, now that he threw you out?
You must have poached a few pheasant yourself. A few rabbits.
I have an idea.
I'm gonna get myself a license as a game dealer.
If a cop stops me – "What've you got there?"
I say, "In my basket? Ten wild rabbits, which I have a license to sell.
Good day, Officer."
Have a cigarette.
And you?
What'll you do now?
I'll stay in the area.
Because of my wife. I want her back.
What are you doing?
Spitting in the water.
It's all I know how to do in life.
Come now.
What's the matter?
Nothing.
It's just unpleasant to be reminded what a failure I am.
If I didn't have a few tolerant friends, I'd starve to death.
But you know how when I was young,
I also thought my day would come.
The contact with an audience, that's what I wanted to have.
It must be an overwhelming feeling.
To think that I missed out on it!
So I feed myself a lot of nonsense, imagine that it did happen.
But it takes a drink.
Back on the porch, I almost thought it had happened.
But after that comes the fall.
You have a rough time, but you get used to it.
Beautiful night. Look at the moon.
Aren't you cold?
No. What about you?
Put your hood up.
It's Lisette.
With Octave.
The skunk!
You sure it's her?
She's wearing her cape. The one I gave her.
I'm cold.
Let's go back.
Not to the château. Never again.
In that case, here in the greenhouse.
What are they saying?
I can't hear a thing.
Got your gun on you?
Let him have it.
I used up my bullets on you.
Poor guy.
But my father wasn't like that.
He was a hero, too. A hero in his own way.
But when you think of your father, you're unfair to other men.
Not at all.
You, you're a fine fellow.
I'm a failure.
No, you're not.
But you need someone to take care of you.
I'll take care of you.
It's too late. I'm too old.
You fool.
You know... it's you I love.
Do you love me?
Yes, Christine. I love you.
Then kiss me.
On the mouth, like a lover.
I'll kill them both.
Not her.
Both of them.
I'll get my gun.
You can't. Not her.
Come with me.
Why don't I stay here just to keep an eye on 'em?
No, we stick together.
There's a train at Lamotte-Beuvron at 3:00 a.m. Let's take it.
I'll get your coat.
Where's Christine? I'm worried.
Don't worry. She's with Octave.
You can trust him. After all, you met her through him.
I don't blame him.
He's a decent fellow. Very decent.
I know.
I believe in little, but I may start believing in friendship.
But Octave is someone special.
Where's Madame?
Get her coat.
Her coat.
Very well.
Somebody pinched my hat. Just great!
This is wrong.
Why wrong?
When it's just for fun, it doesn't matter.
But for living together, the young are for the young and the old for the old.
Did you find my hat?
And you don't have any money. Madame needs lots of things.
What will you do without money?
They trampled it. It's all ruined.
I speak my mind. You're making a mistake.
Madame won't be happy with you.
Will you take me with you?
Sure. You'll join us later.
Where's Christine?
She's waiting for you.
Waiting for me?
In the greenhouse over the footbridge.
Bring her this.
Hurry! In the greenhouse.
You mustn't catch cold.
Thanks so much.
I have to kiss you.
You love her too.
Lisette, please. Am I crying?
I'm suffering and I just hate it.
She's alone.
I'll go talk to her.
Sure, let's go.
Not you. Me.
Listen!
It's him.
Christine!
Did you hear a shot in the park?
In the park?
I was in my room and...
It's André, isn't it?
Yes, Miss Jackie.
And Madame?
Madame is all right.
Thank you.
Is he dead?
He didn't suffer.
He was hit here. He dropped like an animal in the hunt.
He called out for Madame and it was over.
Did you shoot him?
It was Schumacher. But I was in it with him.
Hurry, Corneille.
Why didn't you let me go?
What's to become of me now?
Let me go. Madame needs me.
You're going to give her a kiss.
Give her a kiss and tell her that I left. She'll understand.
I'll say good-bye now to you, too.
Good-bye. - Good-bye, Mr. Octave.
I was so fond of you.
I was fond of you, too.
They need us, Corneille.
By the greenhouse?
Where are you headed?
Back to the woods. I'll try to pick up some odd jobs here and there.
And you?
I'm going to Paris. I'll try to manage on my own.
We may run into each other again someday.
I doubt it. But you never know. Anything's possible.
Good luck.
Will you excuse me?
The greenhouse is off-limits.
Pointard's on guard.
Work out the formalities with Corneille.
I can't bear it!
Be strong, Miss Jackie.
An educated young lady like you has to put on a brave face.
People are watching.
I'll take care of her.
Try to get some sleep. You must be exhausted.
We'll be leaving tomorrow.
It was all a deplorable accident and nothing more.
My game warden thought he saw a poacher and fired.
As fate would have it, André Jurieux paid for this error.
Tomorrow we will leave, in mourning for this delightful friend, this wonderful companion who made us forget that he was famous.
And now, dear friends, it's chilly. You're going to catch cold.
I suggest you come inside.
Tomorrow we'll do our duty for Jurieux.
A new definition of the word "accident."
No, this La Chesnaye has class. And that's become rare, my dear Saint-Aubin.
That's become rare.
These hills here are full of Apaches.
They've burnt every ranch building in sight. He had a brush with 'em last night.
Says they're bein' stirred up by Geronimo.
Geronimo?
How do we know he isn't lying?
Ah, he's a Cheyenne. They hate Apaches worse than we do.
Clear the wires to Lordsburg.
That's Lordsburg now, sir. They seem to have something very urgent to tell you, sir.
Well? Well, what's wrong?
The line went dead, sir.
What do you got there?
Only the first word, sir.
Geronimo."
Steady, whoa! - Well, so long, Buck!
Nice trip, Buck?
Oh, so-so.
Got the payroll for the mining company? - Yes, sir.
Right here in this box here.
Good.
Give me a lift here, Jim, will ya?
Jim, I'll pay ya that two bits when I come through.
Okay, partner.
Hey, now, you kids get away from that wheel.
Well, sir, we run into a little snow up there.
'Tweren't bad, though, but you fellas better prepare for a good frost.
Passenger out for Tonto.
You'd better get out and stretch your leg - I mean, your limbs, ma'am.
We're gonna change horses here.
Is there a place here where I can have a cup of tea?
Well, yes, ma'am. You can get a cup of coffee at the hotel across the street there.
Thank you, driver.
Uh, you look a little peaked -
I'll be all right, thank you.
Why, Lucy Mallory.
Nancy.
How are you, Captain Whitney?
Fine, thanks, Mrs. Mallory.
Why, whatever are you doing in Arizona?
I'm joining Richard in Lordsburg. He's there with his troops.
He's a lot nearer than that, Mrs. Mallory.
He's been ordered to Dry Fork. That's the next stop for the stagecoach.
You'll be with your husband in a few hours.
Oh, I'm so glad to see you, Lucy. Sit down, darling.
We'll have a cup of coffee. You must be tired from that long trip.
Who is that gentleman?
Hardly a gentleman, Mrs. Mallory.
I should think not.
He's a notorious gambler.
Hello, Mink! Hidee, Frank!
Well, Marshal, I'm looking for my shotgun guard.
Is he here?
Out with the posse, Buck, trying to catch the Ringo Kid.
Ringo? I thought Ringo was in the pen.
He was.
Busted out?
Well, good for him.
My guess, the Kid's aiming' to get even with them Plummer boys.
It was their testimony sent him to the penitentiary.
Well, all I gotta say is that he'd better stay away from that there Luke Plummer.
Why, gosh, Luke's run all of Ringo's friends out of Lordsburg.
The last trip there, I seen him hit a rancher on the head with the barrel of his gun... and, well, he just laid it wide open like a butchered steer.
You seen Luke Plummer in Lordsburg?
Yes, sirree.
Hmm. You boys take care of the office for a couple days.
I'm going to Lordsburg with Buck. Gonna ride shotgun.
Oh, gosh, if I could learn to keep my big mouth shut -
Here's the payroll, Mr. Gatewood.
Ever since I opened this bank, I've been trying to tell those people... to deposit their payroll six months in advance.
It's good, sound business.
Good business for you, Mr. Gatewood.
Well, there's your receipt - $50,000.
And remember this - what's good for the banks is good for the country.
Now, now, now, my dear lady -
Good riddance to bad rubbish! Get out and stay out!
I'm keeping your trunk 'cause you ain't paid your rent.
Is this the face...
that wrecked a thousand ships... and burned the towerless tops of Ilium?"
Farewell, fair Helen.
Doc. Doc, can they make me leave town when I don't want to go?
Do I have to go?
Dallas, don't you go makin' no fuss.
Do I have to go, Doc, just because they say so?
Dallas, I've got my orders. Don't blame these ladies.
It ain't them.
It is them!
Doc, haven't I any right to live? What have I done?
We're the victims of a foul disease called social prejudice, my child.
These dear ladies of the Law and Order League are scouring out the dregs of the town.
Come on. Be a proud, glorified dreg like me.
You get going, Doc.
You're drunk. - Two of a kind. - Just two of a kind.
Take my arm, Madame la Comtesse.
The tumbril awaits! To the guillotine!
Oh, wait till I get my badge, girls! I'll join you!
If ever you go East, brother... come out to our house for dinner.
No one in all Kansas City, Kansas, sets a better table than my dear wife, Violet.
Jerry.
Yeah, Doc.
Jerry, I'll admit, as one man to another... that, economically, I haven't been of much value to you.
But... suppose you could put one on credit?
If talk was money, Doc, you'd be the best customer I got.
I'm leaving town, Jerry.
Honest? - Yes, old friend. And I thought you might, out of memory of our many happy -
All right, Doc. Just this one.
Thank you, Jerry.
Here's a man goin' on the stagecoach with you.
He's an Easterner from Kansas City, Missouri.
Kansas City, Kansas, brother.
To your health, Reverend.
I'm not a clergyman. My name is Peacock. I'm a -
He's a whiskey drummer.
A what?
Well, well! How are you, Mr. Haycock?
Peacock.
Don't tell me, sir. I know, I know. A familiar name and an honored name.
I never forget a face or a friend.
Samples?
Ahh! Rye.
Well, Brownie!
Blackie!
Belle!
Bess! - Giddap!
Well, lookee here. Got a pretty good team there.
Whoa!
Back up. Come on in.
Yeah. Back it up.
Got my favorite team there, Slim!
Yeah, Buck, they're all good and fresh. They'll take you right there.
I want five dollars, Henry!
Certainly, my dear. Certainly.
What is it to be this time, my dear?
A pair of shoes - I want to pay the butcher. Dinner's at 12:00.
Don't worry, my dear.
I'll be there. I've invited the ladies of the Law and Order League.
All - All aboard for Dry Fork... All - All aboard for Dry Fork...
Apache Wells, Lee's Ferry and Lordsburg!
I'll take that, Dallas.
Oh, thanks. In you go, Dallas, and a pleasant voyage.
Leave your baggage, Doc?
Thank you. Thank you, my friend.
Curley, my shingle. Carry it with honor.
I'll take it, Doctor.
Oh, no. No trouble at all.
No trouble at all. I'll carry it on my lap.
Here we go. Here we go, Reverend.
Mrs. Whitney, you're not going to let your friend travel with that creature.
She's right, Lucy. And besides, you're not well enough to travel.
It's only a few hours, Nancy. I'm quite all right.
But you shouldn't travel a step without a doctor.
There is a doctor, dear. The driver told me.
Doctor?
Doc Boone?
Why, he couldn't doctor a horse.
Lucy darling, you must be very careful. Take good care of yourself.
Watch that step now. - Lady folks ride facing forward, please.
There you go.
Pleasant journey, Mrs. Mallory.
Thank you. Good-bye!
Good-bye!
Bye!
Like an angel in a jungle.
A very wild jungle.
What are you doin', Hatfield - talkin' to yourself?
You wouldn't understand, cowboy.
You've never seen an angel... nor a gentlewoman... nor a great lady.
Well, so long, Buck! So long, Curley! Nice trip, boys!
So long, kids!
Wait a minute! Hold it there, Buck!
Cavalry comin'!
Steady, girls!
Captain Sickels asks if you'll deliver this dispatch in Lordsburg the moment you arrive.
The telegraph line has been cut.
Sure.
We're going with you as far as the noon station at Dry Fork.
There'll be a troop of cavalry there, and they'll take you on to Apache Wells.
From Apache Wells, you'll have another escort of soldiers into Lordsburg.
But you must warn your passengers that they travel at their own risk.
At their own risk?
What's the trouble, Lieutenant? - Geronimo.
Geronimo?
Well, then I ain't go -
Will you sit down!
Of course, the army has no authority over you gentlemen.
If you think it's unsafe to make the trip -
This stage is goin' to Lordsburg.
If you think it ain't safe to ride along with us...
I figure we can get there without you soldier boys.
I have my orders, sir, and I always obey orders.
Did you all hear what the lieutenant said?
Yes, we heard.
Well, me and Buck are taking this coach through, passengers or not.
Whoever wants to get out can get out.
It's - - Courage.
Courage, Reverend.
Ladies first. - Oh.
Excuse me.
How about you, Dallas?
What are you tryin' to do, scare somebody?
They got me in here. Now let 'em try to put me out.
There are worse things than Apaches.
If you'll take my advice, ma'am, you won't take this trip.
My husband is with his troops in Dry Fork.
If he's in danger, I want to be with him.
You see, brother, I have a wife and five children in Kansas City.
Then you're a man.
By all the powers that be, Reverend, you're a man.
All right, folks.
Make room for one more.
I'm offering my protection to this lady.
I can shoot fairly straight, if there's need for it.
That's been proved too many times, Hatfield.
All right, get in. We're late.
May I trouble you to move over, sir? - Oh, yes.
Yes, of course.
Close the door.
Aw, Curley, we shouldn't -
Get going, Buck!
Bessie! Brownie! Bill!
Farewell, ladies!
Sweetheart! Come on now, girl!
Good-bye!
Whoa! - Room for another passenger?
Sure is, Mr. Gatewood.
Goin' to Lordsburg?
That's right. Just got a telegram.
Had to stop to pack this bag. Oh, I got it in.
Hyah, hyah! Sassy!
Blackie! Brownie! Bill!
All right, Brownie. Queenie, steady, girl.
Good boy. Get along.
If there's anything I don't like, it's drivin' a stagecoach through Apache country.
Funny catching Gatewood outside of town that way.
I just took this job 10 years ago so I could make enough money... to marry my Mexican girl, Julietta, and I been workin' hard at it ever since.
Bonnie, get over there!
Ho!
Marriage?
Well, certainly.
My wife's got more relatives than anyone you ever did see.
I bet I'm feedin' half the state of Chihuahua.
Sweetheart!
Ho! That seem funny to you about Gatewood?
Yeah, and then what do I get to eat when I get home in Lordsburg?
Nothin' but frijole beans. That's all. Nothin' but beans, beans, beans.
Bessie! Brownie! Blackie girl!
Yow! Get along!
Excuse me, ladies. Close quarters.
Warm today.
Your wife made it warm for me, Gatewood.
She was chairman of our farewell committee.
Fine-looking bunch of soldier boys back there.
Always gives me great pride in my country... when I see such fine young men in the U.S. Army.
Anybody know where they're going?
Brother, aren't you aware of what's happened?
Happened? I
I don't follow you, Reverend.
I'm not a clergyman. I'm a -
My friend's a whiskey drummer.
We're all gonna be scalped, Gatewood.
Massacred in one fell swoop.
That's why the soldiers are with us.
He's joking, of course.
Oh, no, he's not. Oh, dear, no. I wish he were.
It's that old Apache butcher, Geronimo.
Geronimo - nice name for a butcher.
He's jumped the reservation. He's on the warpath.
Geronimo? Why weren't the passengers notified? Why wasn't I told?
We -
We were told, Gatewood. Yes.
Weren't you told when you got that message from Lordsburg?
Oh, yes, yes. Y-Yes, of course. I
Steady now! String out!
Sweetheart!
Now, doggone it, they're bringing up her grandfather... all the way from Mexico to live with us.
I can't figure out how he got that message.
Who? Her grandfather?
No, Gatewood.
Sweetheart!
Said he got a message.
Sweetheart!
Telegraph line ain't workin'.
Sweetheart.
Hold it!
Whoa!
Steady! Ho. Ho.
Hey, look, it's Ringo.
Yeah.
Hello, Kid.
Hello, Curley.
Hiya, Buck! How's your folks?
Oh, just fine, Ringo.
Except my grandfather came up -
Shut up.
Didn't expect to see you ridin' shotgun on this run, Marshal.
Goin' to Lordsburg?
I figured you'd be there by this time.
No. Lame horse.
Well, it looks like you've got another passenger.
Yeah.
I'll take the Winchester.
You may need me and this Winchester, Curley.
Saw a ranch house burning' last night.
You don't understand, Kid. You're under arrest.
Curley -
Everything all right, Marshal?
Everything's all right, Lieutenant.
Hope I ain't crowding' you folks none.
The more, the merrier.
Hyah, Bessie! Ain't Ringo a fine boy?
I think so.
You're just smarter than a trade rat.
You knew all the time he was goin' to Lordsburg.
Hey, reckon what he meant he saw ranch houses burning'?
Apaches.
Oh, Apaches.
So, you're the notorious Ringo Kid.
My friends just call me Ringo.
Nickname I had as a kid.
Right name's Henry.
Seems to me I knew your family, Henry.
Didn't I fix your arm once when you were, oh - bucked off a horse?
Are you Doc Boone?
I certainly am.
Now, let's see.
I'd just been honorably discharged from the Union army... after the War of the Rebellion.
You mean the War for the Southern Confederacy, sir.
I mean nothing of the kind, sir.
That was my kid brother broke his arm.
You did a good job, Doc, even if you was drunk.
Thank you, son.
Professional compliments are always pleasing.
Yes, they are.
What happened to that boy whose arm I fixed?
He was murdered.
Put out that cigar.
You're annoying this lady.
Excuse me, madam.
Being so partial to the weed myself... I sometimes forget that it disagrees with others.
A gentleman doesn't smoke in the presence of a lady.
Three weeks ago, I took a bullet out of a man who was shot by a gentleman.
The bullet was in his back.
Do you mean to insinuate -
Sit down, mister.
Doc don't mean no harm.
Hiya, Pete!
Hi, Joey!
Hello!
Be careful of old Bessie up there now.
Take it easy. Hold it steady, girl.
Prepare to dismount!
Take a look and see if there isn't a stone bruising' that hock down there.
If it isn't my old friend, Sergeant Billy Pickett!
Well! How are ya, Billy?
He's fine, Doc, and mighty glad to see ya!
Didn't figure on no stagecoach comin' through... with them Apaches raisin' Cain.
I was just telling Billy to hitch up the buckboard so we could get the young ones in -
Wait a minute!
You mean to say there are no troops at this station?
Ain't no soldiers here but what you see.
But my husband, Captain Mallory - I was told he was here.
He was, dearie. Got orders night afore last to join the soldiers at Apache Wells.
That means we gotta go back.
I can't go back!
Driver, you started this coach for Lordsburg, and it's your duty to get us there.
And it's your duty, young man, to come along with us!
It's my duty, Mr. Gatewood, to obey orders. I'm sorry, sir.
Well, if the soldiers go back, Lieutenant, that means we all have to go back?
My orders are to return from here immediately, and I can't disobey those orders.
I think we can get through all right, Curley.
Oh, now, don't egg him on, Kid.
I'm drivin' this here outfit, and, well, if the soldiers go back, so am I.
I call this a desertion of duty.
I'll report you to your superior officer.
If necessary, I'll take the matter up with Washington!
That's your privilege, sir, but if you give us any trouble here... I'll have to put you under restraint.
Now, don't lose your temper. Don't lose your temper.
I'll tell you how we'll settle it. We'll take a vote.
Inside, everybody. Come on, Buck.
Oh, Curley, I don't wanna go to -
Now you girls set yourselves down. I'll get you something to eat.
Now, folks, if we push on, we can be in Apache Wells by sundown.
Soldiers there will give us an escort as far as the ferry.
Then it's only a hoot and a holler into Lordsburg.
Well, that old mare, I don't -
We've got four men can handle firearms.
Five with you, Ringo.
Doc can shoot, if sober.
I can shoot?
I can shoot?
Now, Miss Mallory, I - I ain't gonna put a lady in danger without she votes for it.
I've traveled all the way here from Virginia.
I'm determined to get to my husband.
I won't be separated any longer.
What's your vote, mister?
Well - Where's your manners, Curley?
Ain't you gonna ask the other lady first?
Well, what do you say?
What difference does it make? Doesn't matter.
I vote that we go on.
I demand it. I'm standing on my legal rights.
What do you say, Hatfield?
Lordsburg.
Four.
You, Doc?
I'm not only a philosopher, sir. I'm a fatalist.
Somewhere, sometime, there may be the right bullet or the wrong bottle... waiting for Josiah Boone.
Why worry when or where?
Yes or no?
Having that philosophy, sir, I've always courted danger.
During the late war, when I had the honor to serve the Union... under our great president, Abraham Lincoln... ah, and General Phil Sheridan... well, sir, I fought 'midst shot and shell and cannon roar!
Do you want to go back or not?
No! I want another drink.
That's five.
How about you, Mr. Hancock?
It's Peacock. I'd like to go on, brother.
I want to reach the bosom of my dear family in Kansas City, Kansas, as quickly as possible... but I may never reach that bosom if we go on.
So, under the circumstances - You understand, brother -
I think it best we go back with the bosoms - I mean, the soldiers.
One against. Well, Buck?
I want -
Buck says aye. That's six.
I'm voting your proxy, Kid. You go with me.
Ain't nothin' keeping me out of Lordsburg, Curley.
There sure ain't. Well, folks, that settles it. We're going through.
Sit down, folks, and eat your grub. Come on, Buck. We'll change them horses.
But, Curley, ain't we gonna eat? Ohh!
You can eat later!
Here you are, folks. Here you are, folks. Food's on the table.
Help yourselves. You got a long ride ahead of ya.
You ain't drinking', Billy.
Sit down here, ma'am.
Thanks.
May I find you another place, Mrs. Mallory?
It's cooler by the window.
Thank you.
Looks like I got the plague, don't it?
No. No, it's not you.
Well, I guess you can't break out of prison and into society in the same week.
Please! Please.
You're ill, Mrs. Mallory.
No, it's just that I -
I'll be all right.
You've been very kind. Why?
In the world I live in, one doesn't often meet a lady, Mrs. Mallory.
Have you ever been in Virginia?
I was in your father's regiment.
I should remember your name. You're Mr. Hatfield.
That's what I'm called, yes.
Why do you look at me like that?
I'm just tryin' to remember.
Ain't I seen you someplace before, ma'am? - No.
No, you haven't. - Hmm.
I wish I had though.
I know you.
I mean, I know who you are. I guess everybody in the territory does.
Yep.
Well, I used to be a good cowhand, but... things happened.
Yeah, that's it.
Things happened.
And now they'll take you back to prison.
Not till I finish a job in Lordsburg.
But you can't.
You're going there as a prisoner.
All aboard for Apache Wells, Lee's Fer -
All righty, folks, the horses are changed. We'd better get going.
And Lordsburg, maybe.
All right, get going, Ringo.
Mrs. Pickett, tell Billy the buckboard is all ready. Let's get going.
All right, Marshal, we're ready.
Come on, folks, let's move.
My compliments to your husband.
Thank you.
I still feel that we ought to go back with the soldiers.
We've got to hurry if we wanna be there by sundown.
Bridesmaid! Baby!
Yow!
What'd you say?
Nothin'.
Well, why don't ya say somethin'?
A fella gets nervous, sittin' here like a dummy, nothin' to think about but the Indians.
You say something! You've been sitting there all day talking without making any sense!
All right, I'll say somethin' that makes sense.
If I was you, I'd let 'em shoot it out.
Let who?
Luke Plummer and the Kid.
There'd be a lot more peace in this territory... if that Luke Plummer was so full of lead he couldn't hold his liquor.
I ain't sayin' I don't share your sentiments, Buck.
But you're a born fool.
Well, I know that.
In the first place, Luke would kill the Kid in a gunfight.
In the second place, if Luke did get shot, he's got two brothers just as ornery as he is.
Nah, the only safe place for Ringo is in the pen, and I aim to get him there all in one piece!
Well, I'll be doggoned if I didn't do you an injury, Curley.
I figured you were after the reward.
Reward?
Why, the Kid's old man and me was friends. We used to punch cattle together.
Besides, I could use that 500 in gold.
Bridesmaid!
Uh-uh! Steady!
Steady, girl!
Bridesmaid! In line!
I can't get over the impertinence of that young lieutenant.
I'll make it warm for that shavetail! I'll report him to Washington!
We pay taxes to the government, and what do we get?
Not even protection from the army.
No. I don't know what the government is coming to.
Instead of protecting businessmen, it pokes its nose into business.
Hmph! Why, they're even talking now about having bank examiners.
As if we bankers don't know how to run our own banks!
Why, Boone, I actually had a letter from a popinjay official... saying they were going to inspect my books!
I have a slogan that should be blazoned on every newspaper in the country -
America for Americans!
The government must not interfere with business!
Reduce taxes!
Our national debt is something shocking!
Over $1 billion a year!
What this country needs is a businessman for president!
What this country needs is more fuddle.
What?
Fuddle!
You're drunk, sir!
I'm happy, Gatewood.
How come you're taking this road? It's gonna be cold up there.
I'm usin' my head. Those breech-clad Apaches don't like snow.
Maybe you'd like to - to sit next to me. I
You could put your head on my shoulder.
No, thank you.
How are you feeling, Mrs. Mallory?
Is there any water?
Driver! Canteen, please!
Just a minute, Mrs. Mallory.
Haven't I seen this crest before?
Isn't this from Greenfield Manor?
I wouldn't know, Mrs. Mallory.
I won this cup on a wager.
How about the other lady?
Thanks.
Sorry. No silver cups.
This is fine.
No.
Please, Doctor.
Howdy, Chris. Seven hours from Dry Fork. Pretty fast driving', amigo!
Get the folks a bite to eat, Chris, while we change horses. We're pushing on to Lordsburg.
You come without soldiers?
Oh, we weren't a-scared. We didn't see one Apache, did we, Curley?
Where's the cavalry, Chris? - Uh-huh.
Where's the soldiers?
There ain't no soldiers.
Huh?
Soldiers have gone.
Where's Captain Mallory?
Where's my husband? Where is he?
You're his wife, I think?
Yes. Where is he?
Did he go with his men? Si, señora.
Little what you call it - scrimmage with the Apaches last night.
Soldiers take Captain Mallory to Lordsburg. I think he get hurt maybe.
Badly?
Si, señora. I think so.
Mrs. Mallory, I'm awfully sorry.
If there's anything I can -
I'm quite all right, thank you.
Marshal!
Come here! Quickly!
Come on, Doc.
Let's go, Doc.
Poor woman.
A sick woman on our hands!
That's all we needed!
I feel kinda sick myself.
We're in a fine fix, my friends. It's a fine country we're living in.
The army has no right to leave a public place like this undefended.
Looks to me like the army's got its hands pretty full, mister.
Have you a wife?
Si, señora, I think.
Call her.
Yakima! ¿Dónde estás?
Ringo, go in the kitchen and get some hot water, lots of hot water, please.
Yes, ma'am.
Hey, Chris!
¿Dónde la cocina?
Aqui está, Kid.
A fine member of the medical profession.
Drunken beast.
Coffee.
Give me coffee.
Black coffee.
Lots of it.
More! More! More!
Ain't it enough, Doc?
That's four. - Blacker! Stronger!
Keep it comin', Curley! - You'll have it coming out your ears in a minute. Drink it down, Doc.
Drink it down. - Get it down.
That'll make you feel better.
All right, Doc.
Isn't that drunken swine sober yet?
He's doing the best he can!
Well, hurry!
Shh!
Está malo.
Tinhorn.
How you feeling?
Fine.
Thanks. Again.
Sit down here, Doc.
Keep the fire going, Chris. - Plenty of hot water.
Si, señor. Si.
Savages!
That's my wife, Yakima.
My squaw. Yes, but she's - she's savage!
Si, señor. She a little bit savage, I think.
Ándale pronto. A calentar agua. A la enferma, pronto.
Something funny about this. That woman's an Apache.
Sure, she's one of Geronimo's people, I think.
Maybe not so bad to have Apache wife, eh? Apache don't bother me, I think.
All right, Doc?
All right.
All right, Dallas.

Ringo!
It's them vaqueros! They've run away!
Yeah, with the spare horses.
Them coyotes give me the creeps. It sounds li - Well, it sounds just like a baby.
Black eight.
It's a baby.
It's a little girl.
It's a little girl.
Well, I'll be doggoned.
Why didn't somebody tell me?
How's Mrs. Mallory?
She's going to be all right.
Well, I'll be doggoned.
Did-Did you know?
Well, I'll be doggoned.
Don't do that.
Dr. Boone.
Come on, boys.
Three cheers for ol' Doc Boone.
Hip, hip -
Quiet.
Well, we oughta be -
Quiet.
Mrs. Mallory.
Kid, I know why you want to go to Lordsburg.
I like you.
I know your pop. He was good friend of mine.
If you know who in Lordsburg, you stay away, I think.
You mean Luke Plummer?
Luke, Ike and Hank - all there together.
I saw them.
Are you sure of that, Chris?
Sure. I can tell you the truth.
I know.
Thanks. - That's all I wanted to know.
You crazy if you go. I think you stay away, Kid.
Three against one is no good.
You oughtn't to go too far, Miss Dallas.
Apaches like to sneak up and pick off strays.
You, uh, visiting' in Lordsburg?
No. No, I have friends there. And maybe I can find work.
Say, look, Kid, why don't you try to escape?
Why don't you get away?
I aim to - in Lordsburg.
Why Lordsburg?
Why don't you make for the border now?
My father and brother were shot down by the Plummer boys.
Guess you don't know how it feels to lose your own folks that way.
I lost mine when I was a kid.
There was a massacre on Superstition Mountain.
That's tough, especially on a girl.
Well, you gotta live no matter what happens.
Yeah. That's it.
Look, Miss Dallas, you got no folks.
And neither have I, and, well... maybe I'm taking a lot for granted, but -
I watched you with that baby... that other woman's baby.
You looked, well -
Well, I still got a ranch across the border.
And it's a nice place, a real nice place.
Trees and grass, water.
There's a cabin half built.
A man could live there... and a woman.
Will you go?
But you don't know me.
You don't know who I am.
I know all I want to know.
Will you go?
Oh, don't talk like that.
What are you doing out here, Kid?
Stick close to the reservation.
Curley!
Oh, Curley!
Oh!
Curley!
Curley!
What's wrong, Chris?
My wife, Yakima - she run away.
When I wake up, she was gone.
The way you come busting in here, you'd think - - Whoa.
Excuse me, Kid.
Come busting in here, you'd think we were being attacked.
You can find another wife.
Sure I can find another wife. But she take my rifle and my horse.
Oh, I never sell her. I love her so much.
I beat her with the whip, and she never get tired.
Your wife? - No.
My horse. Oh.
I can find another wife easy, yes, but not a horse like that.
Mala Yakima.
I knew that woman was a thief, by -
What's the matter with you, Gatewood?
My valise!
Where's my valise? Which one of you have got it?
Here it is. I was usin' it for a pillow. I didn't think you'd mind.
I thought I told you to keep your hands off my things!
Yes, sir.
That squaw of yours will find some Apaches and bring 'em back here.
My wife's people don't bother me, I think.
Well, they bother me, I think.
Chris, is this bar open?
Sure, all the time, señor. Si.
Good.
Here you are, Doc.
Well, what are we wasting time for? Let's make a break for it.
We've got a sick woman to think of.
Do you want her to stay here and be butchered with the rest of us?
Why don't you think of somebody else for once? - Do you realize who you're talking to?
Easy, easy!
Quiet, boys. Quiet.
We ain't been butchered yet. But you're right.
We'd better get going for Lordsburg as soon as we can.
Might be a good idea, Curley, if, uh, Doc took a look at the patient.
Yeah, and Little Coyote.
You'll join me, Doctor?
No, thanks.
Morning.
Well, you're looking pretty chipper.
You're up early, Dallas.
She didn't go to bed, Doctor.
I'm afraid she sat up all night while I slept.
Oh, I slept a lot in the chair.
Well, anyway, it was nice to stay awake and hold the baby.
Hmm. Well, we've got to get you to Lordsburg, Little Coyote.
That's what the boys christened her last night when she squalled
Little Coyote. - How do you feel?
Fine, thanks.
A little tired.
Doctor, do you think my husband -
Never mind him.
The best medicine he can have is to see you two safe and sound.
You just make up your mind you're gonna get there.
I have made up my mind.
That's the stuff.
I am going to get there.
You need strength, so get all the rest you can.
Dallas, do you suppose you can fix up a little broth?
She has already.
Good.
How about making some coffee for the boys?
Now you get some sleep, Mrs. Mallory.
And don't look so proud.
I've brought hundreds of those little fellas into the world... once upon a time.
And the new one was always the prettiest.
Doc.
Ringo asked me to marry him.
Is that wrong for a girl like me?
If a man and woman love each other, it's all right, ain't it, Doc?
You're going to be hurt, child.
Worse than you've ever been hurt.
Don't you know that boy's headed back for prison?
Besides, if you two go into Lordsburg together... he's going to know all about you.
He's not goin' into Lordsburg.
All I want is for you to tell me it's all right.
Gosh, child, who am I to tell you what's right or wrong?
All right.
Go ahead. Do it if you can.
Good luck.
Thanks, Doc.
Ringo -
Well, Doc?
Oh, both doing nicely.
She's a real soldier's wife, that young lady.
Good, good. Then we can leave immediately.
Well, not for a day or so if you want my professional advice.
What do you mean a day?
Stay another day? Why?
Where were you when the stork came last night, Gatewood?
I refuse to allow Mrs. Mallory to travel until she and the child are out of danger.
What do you mean danger?
Aren't we in worse danger here?
I don't wish to intrude. But I've had five children. I mean, my dear wife has.
And much as I dislike discussing it, in this hour of our trial... I - I believe the doctor's right.
Spoken like a man, Reverend.
I say we ought to leave here before the Apaches find us. That's common sense.
I wish you were 10 years younger, Gatewood.
Don't let my white hairs stop you -
Now just a minute!
Quiet! Quiet!
Now, Curley, I haven't said a word!
Will you shut up!
Now, if we argue this thing out right, we can get somewhere. Let's all sit down and talk sensible.
Come on, Buck. Sit down.
There's a young woman in the kitchen making coffee. She needs help.
Thanks, Doc.
Say, Kid.
How old were you when you went to the pen?
Oh, I was... goin' on 17.
Mornin', ma'am.
Morning.
I, uh, laid awake most of the night... wondering what you'd have said if Curley hadn't busted in.
Guess you was up kind of late too.
I could hear you moving around.
You didn't answer what I asked you last night.
Look, Kid, why don't you try to escape?
There's a horse out there in the corral.
Curley won't go after you because he can't leave the passengers in a fix like this.
I gotta go to Lordsburg.
Why don't you go to my ranch and wait for me?
Wait for a dead man.
You haven't got a chance.
It was three against one when the Plummers swore that you killed their foreman, got you sent up.
It'll be three against one in Lordsburg.
Well, there's some things a man just can't run away from.
How can you talk about your life and my life when you're throwing them away?
Yeah. Mine too.
That's what you're throwing away if you go to Lordsburg.
What do you want me to do?
Would it make us any happier if Luke Plummer was dead?
One of his brothers would be after you with a gun.
We'd never be safe.
I don't want that kind of life, Ringo.
Well, I don't see what else I can do.
Go now. Get away.
Forget Lordsburg. Forget the Plummers.
Make for the border, and I'll come to you.
Do you mean that?
Yes, I do.
Will you go with me, Dallas?
Oh, I can't leave Mrs. Mallory and the baby.
I'll come to you from Lordsburg. I swear it.
Well, I oughta have a rifle and -
I've got one.
Right here. - I got it last night when they were all asleep.
You mean you thought of this last night? Yeah.
Don't ask any more questions. Not now.
Aw, gosh, Curley, there ain't no Apaches behind us. Aw, gosh, Curley, there ain't no Apaches behind us. We can still go back to Tonto.
No! I insist we go on to Lordsburg.
What do you think, Chris?
Geronimo between here and Lordsburg - with my horse, I think.
♪ My horse has gone ♪
No, Doctor.
Oh! ♪ She has gone astray with the sun - ♪♪
Quiet, Doc. This is a serious matter, ain't it?
My dear Buck... if I have only one hour to live, I'm going to enjoy myself.
Doctor, I don't begrudge you my samples, but I think -
Now you hush! I've stood enough of you.
Now this is a serious problem, and I'm the only one that's talkin' sense.
Now, Curley, if - - If we can get across that ferry, we'll be all right.
Question is, what are we gonna do about the lady and her baby?
Dr. Boone has settled that for us, sir... and I demand respect for his professional opinion.
Hatfield.
Ringo.
Ringo!
Hurry, Ringo.
Ringo!
Hurry!
Bye, Dallas.
Good-bye!
Ringo! Don't stop! Go on!
Go on! Keep riding!
Ringo, go on! Go on!
You don't need them, Curley. - I ain't gonna run away.
I'll say you ain't.
Look at them hills.
Apaches.
War signals.
Hurry up, Marshal! What's
Why don't we start?
Nice girls!
Yow! Go!
Hey, Curley, why don't you take the cuffs off the Kid? - He's mighty handy with a gun.
You drive them horses. - I'll take care of the Kid.
Oh! Can't you drive any faster?
You thick-headed lout!
We've got to make that ferry.
A man works all his life to get ahold of some money so that he can enjoy life... and has to run into a trap like this.
A trap, brother?
You mean the Apaches?
There's been no sign of them.
You don't see any signs of them.
They strike like rattlesnakes.
If you hadn't insisted on waiting for her, we'd have been across the ferry by this time.
You talk too much, Gatewood.
Your threats don't faze me, Hatfield. You're nothing but a tinhorn gambler.
How would you like to get out and walk?
You can't put me out of a public conveyance.
Now, now, gentlemen. Gentlemen.
Take it easy, Gatewood.
We may need that fight before we get to the ferry.
You wouldn't be much good in a fight, you jailbird!
Oh, leave the Kid alone. He's handcuffed.
Gentlemen, please.
Let's not forget the ladies, bless them.
Let's have a little Christian charity one for the other.
Well, folks, we're coming in to Lee's Ferry now.
Lordsburg - next stop!
Nice girls! Get along!
Get along!
Curley, look. Look at the ferry.
It's burnt too.
Hatfield, stand guard over there.
Where's the army?
What are the soldiers doing?
Curley, what can I do? - Are they going to let Geronimo burn and pillage the whole country?
Ringo, I need you. Will you give me your word you won't try to escape again?
I'll give you my word - till Lordsburg.
Get in the coach with them women.
I gave you my word.
Ringo, don't!
Dallas.
Buck, drive into the river up to the hubs.
Brownie! Bessie! Bridesmaid!
Come on, girls! Hah!
Get down!
Look out, Curley.
Kid, take your suspenders and cross-tie them wheelers.
Sorry about the saddle, Kid.
Ready, Kid? - All set.
Ready, Buck?
All ready, Curley.
Here we go!
Here we go, Buck!
Hyah! Just sit quiet, folks.
You'll be all right. Come on, girl.
♪ All aboard for Lordsburg, Lordsburg ♪
Hey, Curley.
Yeah. What?
You think I ought to charge Mrs. Mallory's baby half fare?
Well, we'll soon be in Lordsburg.
Uh, sorry I flew off the handle, Hatfield.
My apologies, Doctor. No hard feelings, I hope.
All in all, it's been an exciting, very interesting trip. Has it not?
Well, now that the danger's passed, Mr. -
Peacock.
Ladies and gentlemen, since it's most unlikely... that we'll ever have the pleasure of meeting again socially...
I'd like to propose a toast.
Major...
Gatewood...
Ringo.
To your health.
Thank you, sir.
Giddap, girl! Run them! Dry Lake!
Git, girls!
I warned you about this - this danger!
But you wouldn't listen to me! Gatewood, will you shut up!
I've got a patient here!
Let me out of here, I tell you! - Will you shut up! - You sot!
Hey, Kid!
Ringo! Help!
Kid! Kid!
The leaders, Kid!
Get the leaders!
Curley! More ammunition!
Do you hear it?
Do you hear it?
It's a bugle! They're blowing the charge!
If you see Judge Greenfield... tell him his son -
Thank heaven you're safe, Lucy.
Where's Richard? Is he all right?
Oh, he's all right. Don't you worry.
It isn't a bad wound.
We'll take you to him immediately.
Where's the baby, dear?
I'll take the baby.
Dallas.
If there's ever anything I can do for -
I know.
Orderly.
It's the Ringo Kid!
Yeah!
Hey, Curley!
How are you?
Aces and eights.
Dead man's hand, Luke.
Ringo Kid's in town. Yeah.
Drivin' the stage.
Mis hermanos.
Si, patrón. Un momento.
Cash in.
Easy now. Easy. That's right.
Good-bye, Miss Dallas.
If you ever come to Kansas City, Kansas, I want you to come out to see us.
Oh, thanks, Mr., uh -
Peacock.
Hello, Buck.
They got here all right. - You got through all right.
All right, folks, you're here.
All right, folks. You're all right.
Unload. Here you are, Doctor. Will you sign this?
Well, Lordsburg.
Thank you. And you, Doctor.
Well, Kid.
Curley, how long will they give me for breakin' out?
Oh, about another year.
You know where my ranch is?
Yeah.
Will you see that she gets there all right?
Dallas.
Yeah.
This is no town for a girl like her.
Will you do it?
Sure.
Thanks.
How are ya, Marshal? Get my man through all right?
I don't need them.
If you don't want to lose your prisoner, Sheriff, you'd better take care of him yourself.
What's your name, mister?
My name is Gatewood.
Ellsworth H. Gatewood.
Oh. Gatewood. You didn't think they'd have the telegraph wires fixed, did you?
You thought you escaped.
Can I meet you back here in 10 minutes?
I gave you my word, Curley. I ain't goin' back on it now.
No ammunition.
I lied to you, Curley.
Got three left.
Come on.
Good night, Kid.
Is this where you live?
No. I gotta know where you live, don't I? No.
Don't come any further.
It's all been a crazy dream.
I've been out of my mind just hopin'.
Say good-bye here, Kid.
We ain't never gonna say good-bye.
Could I have that?
Give me the shotgun.
Shotgun!
Luke! Luke, please don't!
Well, Kid, I - I told you not to follow me.
Dallas.
I asked you to marry me, didn't I?
I'll never forget you asked me, Kid.
That's something.
Wait here.
Uh - Ringo said he'll be passing this way in... six or seven minutes.
Come on.
I'll take that shotgun, Luke.
You'll take it in the belly if you don't get out of my way.
I'll have you indicted for murder if you step outside with that shotgun.
We'll attend to you later.
Don't ever let me do that again.
Luke.
Hey, Billy! Billy, kill that story about the Republican convention in Chicago and take this down!
The Ringo Kid was killed on Main Street in Lordsburg tonight!
And among the additional dead was" - Leave that blank for a spell.
I didn't hear any shooting', Ed.
You will, Billy. You will.
Hank missed him - at four feet.
Ringo. Ringo.
Ringo.
Ready, Kid?
Thanks, Curley.
Curley's gonna see that you get to my place across the border.
Well, good-bye, Dallas.
Good-bye.
Maybe you'd like to ride a ways with the Kid.
Please.
Well, they're saved from the blessings of civilization.
Yeah.
Doc?
I'll, uh, buy you a drink.
Just one.
She isn't coming yet, Toto.
Did she hurt you?
She tried to, didn't she?
Come on. We'll go tell Uncle Henry and Auntie Em. Come on, Toto.
Aunt Em! Aunt Em!
Just listen to what Miss Gulch did to Toto--
Dorothy, please. We're counting.
But she hit him--
Don't bother us now, honey.
The incubator's gone bad and we're likely to lose a lot of our chicks.
Oh, that poor little thing.
But Miss Gulch hit Toto with a rake because she says he chases her nasty old cat every day!
seventy.
Dorothy, please!
But he doesn't do it every day! Just once or twice a week.
He can't catch her old cat anyway.
And now she says she's gonna--
Dorothy. Dorothy, we're busy.
Oh, all right.
How's she coming?
Take it easy.
You got my finger!
Get your finger out of the way.
There you are.
Right on my finger!
Lucky it wasn't your head.
Zeke, what am I gonna do about Miss Gulch?
Just because Toto--
Listen, honey, I got them hogs to get in.
Dorothy, you ain't using your head.
You'd think you didn't have any brains.
I have so got brains.
Well, why don't you use them?
Don't go by Miss Gulch's place.
Then Toto won't get in her garden, and you won't get in no trouble, see?
Oh, Hunk, you just won't listen, that's all.
Well, your head ain't made of straw, you know.
Say, get in there before I make a dime bank out of you.
Listen, kid are you gonna let that old Gulch heifer try and buffalo you?
She ain't nothing to be afraid of. Have a little courage.
I'm not afraid of her.
Next time she squawks, walk up to her and spit in her eye. That's what I'd do.
Oh! Zeke!
Help! Help me, Zeke! Get me out of here!
Help!
Are you all right, Dorothy?
Yes, I'm all right.
I fell in, and Zeke--
Why, Zeke, you're just as scared as I am.
You gonna let a little old pig make a coward out of you?
Look at you--
What's all this jabber-wapping when there's work to be done?
I know three farm hands that'll be out of a job.
Dorothy was--
I saw you tinkering with that contraption.
You and Hunk get back to that wagon.
All right.
But someday they'll erect a statue to me--
Well, don't start posing for it now.
Can't work on an empty stomach. Have some crullers.
Gosh, Mrs. Gale.
Just fried.
You see, Dorothy toppled into the--
It's no place for Dorothy around a pigsty!
Feed those hogs before they worry themselves into anemia!
Yes.
Auntie Em you know what Miss Gulch said she was going to do to Toto?
She said she'd--
Stop imagining things.
You always get in a fret over nothing.
You just help us out today and find yourself a place where you won't get into any trouble.
Someplace where there isn't any trouble.
Do you suppose there is such a place, Toto?
There must be.
It's not a place you can get to by a boat or a train.
It's far, far away.
Behind the moon beyond the rain....
Somewhere
Over the rainbow
Way up high
There's a land that I heard of
Once in a lullaby
Somewhere
Over the rainbow
Skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream
Really do
Come true
Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds
Are far behind me
Where troubles melt like lemon drops
Away above the chimney tops
That's where you'll
Find me
Somewhere
Over the rainbow
Bluebirds fly
Birds fly
Over the rainbow
Why then
Oh, why
Can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly
Beyond the rainbow
Why, oh, why
Can't I?
Mr. Gale.
Howdy, Miss Gulch.
I want to see you and your wife about Dorothy.
What has Dorothy done?
What's she done?
I'm all but lame from the bite on my leg!
You mean, she bit you?
No, her dog! Oh.
She bit her dog, eh?
No.
That dog's a menace. I'm taking him to make sure he's destroyed.
Destroyed! Toto?
Oh, you can't! You mustn't!
Auntie Em! Uncle Henry! You won't let her, will you?
Of course we won't.
Uh, will we, Em?
Please, Aunt Em!
Toto didn't know he was doing anything wrong.
I'm the one that ought to be punished. Send me to bed without supper.
Hand over that dog or I'll bring a suit that'll take your farm!
The law protects folks against dogs that bite!
How about if she keeps him tied up?
He's gentle.
With gentle people, that is.
That's for the sheriff to decide.
This order allows me to take him. Unless you wanna go against the law.
Yes.
We can't go against the law. I'm afraid poor Toto has to go.
Now you're seeing reason.
No.
Here's what I'm taking him in, so he can't attack me again.
No, no!
I won't let you take him!
You go away or I'll bite you myself!
Dorothy!
You wicked old witch! Uncle Henry, Auntie Em, don't let her take Toto.
I've got an order!
Let me have him!
Please stop!
Put him in the basket, Henry.
The idea!
Don't, Uncle Henry.
Oh, Toto!
Almira Gulch, just because you own half the county doesn't mean you can run the rest of us!
For 23 years I've been dying to tell you what I thought of you!
And now--
Well, being a Christian woman, I can't say it!
Toto, darling!
Oh, I got you back! You came back!
I'm so glad! Toto.
They'll be coming back for you in a minute.
We've got to get away!
We've got to run away!
Well, well, well! Houseguests, eh?
And who might you be?
No, no. Now, don't tell me.
Let's see. You're, uh--
You're traveling in disguise.
No, that's not right. You're--
You're going on a visit.
No, I'm wrong. Let's see what we--
You're- - You're running away.
How did you guess? - Ha, ha.
Professor Marvel never guesses, he knows.
Now, why are you running away?
No, no. Now, don't tell me. Uh....
They- - They don't understand you at home. They don't appreciate you.
You want to see other lands.
Big cities, big mountains, big oceans.
Why, it's just like you could read what was inside of me.
Toto, that's not polite! We haven't been asked yet.
Oh, he's perfectly welcome.
As one dog to another, huh? Ha, ha.
Now, let's see, where were we?
Why can't we go with you and see all the crowned heads of Europe?
Do you know any? Oh, you mean the thing.
Yes.
Well, uh, I never do anything without consulting my crystal first.
Let's go inside here. We'll-- Just come along. I'll show you.
That's right. Here.
Sit right down here. That's it. Ha, ha.
This is the same genuine, magic, authentic crystal used by the priests of Isis and Osiris in the days of the Pharaohs in which Cleopatra saw the approach of Julius Caesar and Marc Anthony.
And so on, and so on.
Now you'd better close your eyes, my child, for a moment in order to be better in tuned with the Infinite.
We can't do these things without reaching out into the Infinite.
Yes, that's all right. Now you can open them.
We'll gaze into the crystal.
What's this I see?
A house with a picket fence and a barn with a weathervane of a running horse.
That's our farm! - Yes.
Yes. There's a woman.
She's wearing a polka-dot dress.
That's Aunt Em.
Yes. Her name is Emily.
That's right. What's she doing?
Well, I can't quite see.
Why, she's crying. Someone has hurt her.
Someone has just about broken her heart.
Me?
Well, it's- - It's someone she loves very much.
Someone she's been very kind to.
Someone she's taken care of in sickness.
I had the measles once, and she stayed right by me every minute.
What's she doing now?
Yes, she's- - What's this?
Why, she's putting her hand on her heart!
She's dropping down on the bed.
Oh, no, no!
Well, that's all. The crystal's gone dark.
You don't suppose she could really be sick, do you?
Oh, I've gotta go home right away.
I thought you were going with me.
No, I have to get to her right away!
Come on, Toto! Come on!
Goodbye, Professor Marvel. And thanks a lot!
Better get under cover, Sylvester. A storm's blowing up.
A whopper, to speak in the vernacular of the peasantry.
Poor little kid. I hope she gets home all right.
Get them horses loose!
Where's Hickory?
Hickory?
Doggone it!
It's a twister! It's a twister!
Dorothy!
Dorothy!
Everybody in the storm cellar!
Henry, I can't find Dorothy!
She's out in the storm!
We can't look for her now.
Come on, get in the cellar! Hurry up!
Auntie Em!
Auntie Em?
Auntie Em!
Auntie Em!
Uncle Henry!
Auntie Em!
We must be up inside the cyclone!
Oh! Miss Gulch!
Toto I have a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.
We must be over the rainbow!
Now I know we're not in Kansas.
Are you a good witch or a bad witch?
Who, me?
Why, I'm not a witch at all.
I'm Dorothy Gale, from Kansas. - Oh.
Well, is that the witch?
Who, Toto?
Toto's my dog.
I'm a little muddled.
The Munchkins called me because a new witch just dropped a house on the Wicked Witch of the East.
And there's the house, and here you are and that's all that's left of the Wicked Witch of the East.
What the Munchkins want to know is are you a good witch or a bad witch?
But I've already told you, I'm not a witch at all.
Witches are old and ugly.
What was that?
The Munchkins. They're laughing because I am a witch.
I'm Glinda, the Witch of the North.
You are?
Oh, I beg your pardon!
But I've never heard of a beautiful witch before.
Only bad witches are ugly.
The Munchkins are happy because you freed them...
...from the Wicked Witch of the East.
But if you please, what are Munchkins?
The little people who live here.
It's Munchkinland and you are their national heroine, my dear.
It's all right. You may all come out and thank her.
Come out, come out Wherever you are
And meet the young lady Who fell from a star
She fell from the sky She fell very far
And Kansas, she says Is the name of the star
Kansas, she says
Is the name of the star
She brings you good news
Or haven't you heard?
When she fell out of Kansas
A miracle occurred
It really was no miracle What happened was just this
The wind began to switch The house to pitch
And suddenly the hinges Started to unhitch
Just then the Witch To satisfy an itch
Went flying on her broomstick Thumbing for a hitch
And oh, what happened then was rich
The house began to pitch
The kitchen took a slitch
It landed on the Wicked Witch In the middle of a ditch
Which was not a healthy situation For the Wicked Witch
The house began to pitch The kitchen took a slitch
It landed on the Wicked Witch In the middle of a ditch
Which was not a healthy
Situation for the Wicked Witch
Who began to twitch And was reduced to just a stitch
Of what was once
The Wicked Witch
We thank you very sweetly
For doing it so neatly
You've killed her so completely
That we thank you very sweetly
Let the joyous news be spread!
The Wicked Old Witch at last is dead!
Ding-Dong!
The Witch is dead Which old witch?
The Wicked Witch
Ding-Dong! The Wicked Witch is dead
Wake up, you sleepyhead Rub your eyes, get out of bed
Wake up
The Wicked Witch is dead
She's gone where the goblins go Below, below, below
Yo-ho! Let's open up and sing And ring the bells out
Ding-Dong! The merry-o Sing it high, sing it low
Let them know The Wicked Witch is dead
As mayor of the Munchkin City
In the county of the Land of Oz
I welcome you most regally
But we've got to verify it legally
To see
To see?
If she
If she?
Is morally, ethically
Spiritually, physically
Positively, absolutely
Undeniably and reliably dead
As coroner I must aver
I thoroughly examined her
And she's not only merely dead
She's really most sincerely dead
Then this is a Day of Independence for all the Munchkins and their descendants.
If any!
Yes, let the joyous news be spread.
The Wicked Old Witch at last is dead!
Ding-Dong! The Witch is dead Which old witch?

We represent the Lullaby League

We wish to welcome you To Munchkinland
We represent the Lollipop Guild
The Lollipop Guild The Lollipop Guild
And in the name of the Lollipop Guild
We wish to welcome you To Munchkinland

From now on you'll be history
You'll be his--
You'll be history
And we will glorify your name
You will be a bust
Be a bust
Be a bust
In the hall of fame
I thought you said she was dead.
That was her sister, the Wicked Witch of the East.
This is the Wicked Witch of the West. She's worse than the other one was.
Who killed my sister? Who killed the Witch of the East?
Was it you?
No. No, it was an accident. I didn't mean to kill anybody.
Well, my little pretty, I can cause accidents too!
Aren't you forgetting the ruby...
...slippers?
The slippers. Yes!
The slippers!
They're gone!
The ruby slippers! What have you done with them?
Give them back to me or I'll--
It's too late!
There they are and there they'll stay!
Give me back my slippers!
Only I know how to use them.
They're of no use to you.
Give them back to me.
Give them back!
Keep tight inside of them.
Their magic must be powerful or she wouldn't want them so badly.
Stay out of this, Glinda, or I'll fix you as well!
Oh, rubbish! You have no power here.
Begone, before somebody drops a house on you too.
Very well. I'll bide my time.
And as for you, it's true I can't attend to you here and now as I'd like.
But just try to stay out of my way!
Just try!
I'll get you, my pretty and your little dog too!
It's all right. You can get up. She's gone!
It's all right. You can all get up.
Oh! What a smell of sulfur!
I'm afraid you've made an enemy of the Wicked Witch.
The sooner you get out of Oz altogether, the safer you'll sleep, my dear.
Oh, I'd give anything to get out of Oz altogether.
But which is the way back to Kansas?
I can't go the way I came.
No, that's true.
The only person who might know would be the great and wonderful Wizard of Oz himself.
The Wizard of Oz?
Is he good or is he wicked?
Oh, very good, but very mysterious.
He lives in the Emerald City, a long journey from here.
Did you bring your broomstick with you?
No, I'm afraid I didn't.
Well, then, you'll have to walk.
The Munchkins will see you safely to the border of Munchkinland.
And remember, never let those ruby slippers off your feet for a moment or you will be at the mercy of the Wicked Witch of the West.
But how do I start for Emerald City?
It's always best to start at the beginning.
And all you do is follow the Yellow Brick Road.
But what happens if I--
Just follow the Yellow Brick Road.
Goodbye!
My!
People come and go so quickly here!
Follow the Yellow Brick Road
Follow the Yellow Brick Road
Follow the Yellow Brick Road
Follow the Yellow Brick Road
Follow the Yellow Brick Road
Follow the Yellow Brick Road Follow the Yellow Brick Road
Follow, follow, follow, follow Follow the Yellow Brick Road
Follow the Yellow Brick Follow the Yellow Brick
Follow the Yellow Brick Road
You're off to see the Wizard The wonderful Wizard of Oz
You'll find he is a whiz of a wiz If ever a wiz there was
If ever, oh ever a wiz there was The Wizard of Oz is one because
Because, because, because Because, because
Because of the wonderful things he does
You're off to see the Wizard The wonderful Wizard of Oz
Follow the Yellow Brick Road?
Follow the Yellow...?
Now which way do we go?
Pardon me! That way is a very nice way.
Who said that?
Don't be silly, Toto.
Scarecrows don't talk.
It's pleasant down that way too.
That's funny. Wasn't he pointing the other way?
Of course, people do go both ways.
Why, you did say something, didn't you?
Are you doing that on purpose, or can't you make up your mind?
That's the trouble. I can't make up my mind.
I haven't got a brain.
Only straw.
How can you talk if you haven't got a brain?
I don't know.
But some people without brains do a lot of talking, don't they?
Yes, I guess you're right.
Well, we haven't really met properly, have we?
Why, no.
How do you do?
How do you do?
Very well, thank you.
Oh, I'm not feeling at all well.
It's very tedious being stuck up here all day long with a pole up your back.
Oh, dear. That must be terribly uncomfortable. Can't you get down?
Down? No, you see, I'm-
Well, I'm--
Oh, well, here. Let me help you.
Oh, that's very kind of you. Very kind.
Oh, dear. I don't see....
Of course, I'm not bright about doing things but if you'll just bend the nail down, maybe I'll slip off and--
Oh, yes!
There goes some of me again!
Does it hurt you?
Oh, no. I just keep picking it up and putting it back in again.
My! It's good to be free!
Did I scare you?
No, no. I just thought you hurt yourself.
But I didn't scare you?
No, of course not.
I didn't think so.
Boo! Scat! Boo!
You see?
I can't even scare a crow.
They come from miles around just to eat in my field and laugh in my face.
Oh, I'm a failure, because I haven't got a brain!
Well, what would you do with a brain if you had one?
Do?
Why, if I had a brain, I could--
I could while away the hours Conferring with the flowers
Consulting with the rain
And my head I'd be scratchin' While my thoughts were busy hatchin'
If I only had a brain
I'd unravel every riddle For any individ'le
In trouble or in pain
With the thoughts you'd be thinkin' You could be another Lincoln
If you only had a brain
Oh, I could tell you why
The ocean's near the shore
I could think of things I never thunk before
And then I'd sit And think some more
I would not be just a nothin' My head all full of stuffin'
My heart all full of pain
I would dance and be merry Life would be a ding-a-derry
If I only had a brain
Wonderful!
Why, if our scarecrow back in Kansas could do that...
...the crows would be scared to pieces!
They would?
Where's Kansas?
That's where I live.
I wanna get back there so badly, I'm going to Emerald City to get the Wizard of Oz to help me.
You're going to see a wizard? - Mm-hm.
Do you think if I went, this wizard would give me brains?
I couldn't say.
But even if he didn't, you'd be no worse off than you are now.
Yes, that's true.
But maybe you better not.
I've got a witch mad at me, and you might get into trouble.
Witch?
I'm not afraid of a witch! I'm not afraid of anything!
Except a lighted match.
I don't blame you for that.
But I'd face a whole box of them for the chance of getting some brains.
Look, I won't be any trouble, because I don't eat a thing.
And I won't try to manage things, because I can't think.
Won't you take me with you?
Why, of course I will!
Hooray! We're off to see a wizard!
You're not starting out very well.
Oh, I'll try! Really, I will.
To Oz?
To Oz!
We're off to see the Wizard
The wonderful Wizard of Oz
We hear he is a whiz of a wiz If ever a wiz there was
If ever, oh ever a wiz there was The Wizard of Oz is one because
Because, because, because Because, because
Because of the wonderful things he does
We're off to see the wizard The wonderful Wizard of Oz
Apples!
Oh, look!
What do you think you're doing?
We've been walking a long ways and I was hungry and--
Did you say something?
She was hungry!
She was hungry!
How would like to have someone come along and pick something off of you?
Oh, dear! I keep forgetting I'm not in Kansas.
Come along, Dorothy.
You don't want any of those apples. Hmm.
Are you hinting my apples aren't what they ought to be?
Oh, no! It's just that she doesn't like little green worms.
Oh, you!
I'll show you how to get apples.
Hooray!
I guess that did it. Help yourself.
Why, it's a man!
A man made out of tin!
Yes!
Look!
Did you say something?
He said "oilcan."
Oil can what?
Oilcan?
Oh, here it is.
Where do you want to be oiled first?
He said his mouth.
The other side.
My goodness! I can talk again! Oh!
Oil my arms, please. Oil my elbows.
Here.
Did that hurt?
No, it feels wonderful.
I've held that ax up for ages.
Goodness! How did you ever get like this?
Well, about a year ago I was chopping that tree when suddenly it began to rain.
And right in the middle of a chop, I rusted solid.
And I've been that way ever since.
Well, you're perfect now.
My neck. My neck.
Perfect?
Bang on my chest if you think I'm perfect.
Go ahead, bang on it!
Beautiful! What an echo!
It's empty.
The tinsmith forgot to give me a heart.
No heart? - No heart?
No heart.
All hollow.
When a man's an empty kettle
He should be on his mettle
And yet I'm torn apart
Just because I'm presumin' That I could be kind of human
If I only had a heart
I'd be tender, I'd be gentle And awful sentimental
Regarding love and art
I'd be friends with the sparrows
And the boy who shoots the arrows
If I only had a heart
Picture me A balcony
Above, a voice sings low
Wherefore art thou, Romeo?
I hear a beat
How sweet!
Just to register emotion Jealousy, devotion
And really feel the part
I could stay young and chipper And I'd lock it with a zipper
If I only had a heart
Are you all right?
I'm a little rusty yet.
Oh, dear!
That was wonderful!
You know we were wondering why you couldn't come with us to the Emerald City to ask the Wizard of Oz for a heart.
Suppose the Wizard wouldn't give me one when we got there.
Oh, but he will!
He must!
We've come such a long way already.
You call that long?
Why, you've just begun!
Helping the little lady along, are you, my fine gentlemen?
Well, stay away from her or I'll stuff a mattress with you!
And you!
I'll use you for a beehive!
Here, scarecrow. Wanna play ball?
Fire! I'm burning!
I'm burning!
I'm not afraid of her.
I'll see you get safely to the Wizard, whether I get a brain or not!
Stuff a mattress with me!
I'll see you reach the Wizard, whether I get a heart or not.
Beehive! Bah!
Let her try and make a beehive out of me.
Oh, you're the best friends anybody ever had.
And it's funny but I feel as if I've known you all the time.
But I couldn't have, could I?
I don't see how.
You weren't around when I was stuffed and sewn together, were you?
And I was standing over there rusting for the longest time.
Still, I wish I could remember.
But I guess it doesn't matter anyway. We know each other now, don't we?
That's right.
We do.
To Oz?
To Oz!
We're off to see the Wizard
The wonderful Wizard of Oz
We hear he is a whiz of a wiz If ever a wiz there was
If ever, oh ever a wiz there was The Wizard of Oz is one because
Because, because, because Because, because
Because of the wonderful things he does
We're off to see the Wizard The wonderful Wizard of Oz
I don't like this forest.
It's dark and creepy.
Of course, I don't know, but I think it'll get darker before it gets lighter.
Do....
Do you suppose we'll meet any wild animals?
We might.
Animals that eat straw?
Some, but mostly lions and tigers and bears.
Lions!
And tigers?
And bears!
Lions and tigers and bears!
Oh, my!
Lions and tigers and bears!
Oh, my!
Lions and tigers and bears!
Oh, my!
Lions and tigers and bears!
Oh, my!
Lions and tigers and bears!
Oh, my!
Put 'em up! Put 'em up!
Which one of you first?
I'll fight you both together, if you want.
I'll fight you with one paw tied behind my back!
I'll fight you standing on one foot!
I'll fight you with my eyes closed!
Oh, pulling an ax on me, eh?
Sneaking up on me, eh?
Why....
Here, here. Go away and let us alone.
Oh, scared, huh?
Afraid, huh?
How long can you stay fresh in that can?
Come on, get up and fight, you shivering junkyard.
Put your hands up, you lopsided bag of hay!
That's getting personal, Lion.
Yes, get up and teach him a lesson.
What's wrong with you teaching him?
Well, I hardly know him.
I'll get you anyway, peewee.
Shame on you!
What did you do that for?
No, but you tried to.
It's bad enough picking on a straw man, but picking on poor little dogs....
Well, you didn't have to go and hit me, did you?
Is my nose bleeding?
Well, of course not.
My goodness, what a fuss you're making!
Well, naturally, when you go around picking on things weaker than you are....
You're nothing but a big coward!
You're right, I am a coward!
I haven't any courage at all.
I even scare myself!
Look at the circles under my eyes.
I haven't slept in weeks.
Why don't you try counting sheep?
That doesn't do any good. I'm afraid of them.
Oh, that's too bad.
Don't you think the Wizard could help him too?
I don't see why not.
Come along with us.
We're on our way to see the Wizard. To get him a heart.
And him a brain.
He could give you some courage.
Wouldn't you feel degraded to be seen in the company of a cowardly lion?
I would.
No, of course not.
Gee, that's awfully nice of you.
My life has been simply unbearable. - Oh.
Well, it's all right now.
The Wizard'll fix everything.
It's been in me so long.
I just gotta tell you how I feel.
Well, come on!
Yeah, it's sad Believe me, missy
When you're born to be a sissy
Without the vim and verve
But I could show my prowess Be a lion, not a mouse
If I only had the nerve
I'm afraid there's no denyin' I'm just a dandelion
A fate I don't deserve
I'd be brave as a blizzard
I'd be gentle as a lizard
I'd be clever as a gizzard
If the Wizard is a wizard Who will serve
Then I'm sure to get a brain
A heart
A home
The nerve!
We're off to see the Wizard The wonderful Wizard of Oz
We hear he is a whiz of a wiz If ever a wiz there was
If ever, oh ever a wiz there was The Wizard of Oz is one because
Because, because, because Because, because
Because of the wonderful things he does
We're off to see the Wizard The wonderful Wizard of Oz
So you won't take warning, eh?
All the worse for you, then.
I'll take care of you now instead of later! Ah.
When I gain those ruby slippers my power will be the greatest in Oz!
And now, my beauties something with poison in it, I think.
With poison in it.
But attractive to the eye and soothing to the smell!
Poppies.
Poppies!
Poppies will put them to sleep.
Sleep....
Now they'll sleep.
There's Emerald City!
Oh, we're almost there! At last! At last!
It's beautiful, isn't it?
Just like I knew it would be.
He really must be a wonderful wizard to live in a city like that.
Come on, what are we waiting for?
Nothing! Let's hurry!
Yes, let's run!
Come on! Come on!
Hurry!
Hurry!
Oh, look!
Come on!
Come on!
Look at the scenery.
It's wonderful!
Emerald City!
What's happening?
What is it?
I can't run anymore. I'm so sleepy.
Give us your hands...
...and we'll pull you.
Oh, no, please. I have to rest for just a minute.
Toto.
Where's Toto?
You can't rest now. We're nearly there.
Don't cry. You'll rust yourself again!
Coming to think of it, forty winks wouldn't be bad.
Don't you start it too!
No!
We ought to carry Dorothy.
I don't think I could, but we could try.
Let's.
Yes.
Now look at him. This is terrible!
Here, Tin Man, help me.
Oh, this is terrible! I can't budge her an inch.
This is a spell, this is!
It's the Wicked Witch! What'll we do?
Help!
Help!
It's no use screaming at a time like this.
Nobody will hear you! Help!
Help! - Help!
It's snowing!
No, it isn't.
Yes, it is!
Maybe that'll help!
Oh, but it couldn't help!
It does help! Dorothy, you're waking up!
Unusual weather we're having, ain't it?
Look!
He's rusted again.
Oh, give me the oilcan, quick!
He is rusted.
Here.
Here.
Quick!
Curses! Curses!
Somebody always helps that girl.
But shoes or no shoes, I'm still great enough to conquer her.
And woe to those who try to stop me!
Come on.
Let's get out of here. Look! Emerald City is closer and prettier than ever!
You're out of the woods
You're out of the dark You're out of the night
Step into the sun Step into the light
Keep straight ahead for The most glorious place
On the face of the earth Or the sky
Hold on to your breath Hold on to your heart
Hold on to your hope
March up to the gate And bid it open
To the Emerald City, as fast as lightning!
You're out of the woods
You're out of the dark You're out of the night
Step into the sun Step into the light
March up to the gate And bid it
Open
Open
Who rang that bell?
We did!
Can't you read?
Read what?
The notice!
What notice? - It's on the door!
As plain as the nose on my face!
Bell out of order. Please knock."
Well! That's more like it!
Now, state your business.
We wanna see the Wizard.
The Wizard?
But nobody can see the great Oz.
Nobody's ever seen the great Oz! Even I've never seen him!
Well, then, how do you know there is one?
Because he's--
Oh! You're wasting my time!
Oh, please. Please, sir.
I've got to see the Wizard.
The Good Witch of the North sent me.
Prove it!
She's wearing the ruby slippers that she gave her.
Oh! So she is! Well, bust my buttons!
Why didn't you say that in the first place?
That's a horse of a different color! Come on in!
Cabby!
Cabby!
Just what you're looking for. Take you any place in the city, we does.
Would you take us to see the Wizard?
The Wizard?
The Wizard?
Yes, of course. But first I'll take you to a little place where you can...
...tidy up a bit.
Oh, thank you so much!
We've been gone such a long time, and we feel so mess--
What kind of a horse is that?
I've never seen a horse like that before!
No, and never will again, I fancy.
There's only one of him, and he's it.
He's the horse of a different color you've heard tell about. Ha, ha!
Ha-ha-ha! Ho-ho-ho!
And a couple of tra-la-las
That's how we laugh the day away In the merry old land of Oz
And a couple of la-di-das
That's how the crickets crick all day In the merry old land of Oz
We get up at 12
And start to work at 1
Take an hour for lunch And then at 2 we're done
Jolly good fun!
Ho-ho-ho! And a couple of tra-la-las
That's how we laugh the day away In the merry old land of Oz
Ho-ho-ho!
That's how we laugh the day away With a
Ho-ho-ho!
Ha-ha-ha!
In the merry old land of Oz
Pat, pat here
Pat, pat there
And a couple of brand-new straws
That's how we keep you young and fair In the merry old land of Oz
Rub, rub here
Rub, rub there
Whether you're tin or bronze
That's how we keep you in repair In the merry old land of Oz
We can make a dimpled smile Out of a frown
Can you even dye my eyes To match my gown?
Uh-huh - Jolly old town!
Clip, clip here
Clip, clip there
We give the roughest claws
That certain air of savoir-faire In the merry old land of Oz
That's how we laugh the day away In the merry old land of Oz
That's how we laugh the day away
With a ha-ha-ha
In the merry old land of Oz
Who's her? Who's her?
It's the witch! She's followed us here!
Surrender, Dorothy."
Dorothy?
Who's Dorothy?
The Wizard will explain it!
To the Wizard!
To the Wizard!
Dear! Whatever shall we do?
We better hurry if we're gonna see the Wizard!
Here! Here, here! Everything is all right.
Stop that now, just--
It's all right! Everything is all right!
The great and powerful Oz has got matters well in hand.
I hope.
So you can all go home!
There's nothing to worry about!
Get out of here. Now go on! Go on home.
Go home.
We want to see the Wizard right away.
All four of us.
Orders are, nobody can see the great Oz! Not nobody, not nohow!
But, please! It's very important.
I got a permanent just for the occasion.
Not nobody, not nohow!
But she's Dorothy!
The witch's Dorothy?
Well, that makes a difference.
Just wait here. I'll announce you at once.
Did you hear that?
He'll announce us at once.
I've as good as got my brain.
I can fairly hear my heart beating.
I'll be home for supper.
In another hour, I'll be king of the forest.
Long live the king!
If I were king of the forest
Not queen
Not duke
Not prince
My regal robes of the forest
Would be satin
Not cotton
Not chintz
I'd command each thing Be it fish or fowl
With a woof!
And a woof!
And a royal growl
As I'd click my heel All the trees would kneel
And the mountains bow And the bulls kowtow
And the sparrow
Would take wing
If I
If I were king
Each rabbit would show respect to me
The chipmunks genuflect to me
Though my tail would lash
I would show compash
For every underling
If I
If I were king
Just king
Monarch of all I survey
Monarch
Of all I survey
If you were king, you wouldn't be afraid of anything?
Not nobody, not nohow!
Not even a rhinoceros?
Imposserous!
How about a hippopotamus?
I'd trash him from top to "bottom-us."
Supposing you met an elephant?
I'd wrap him up in "cello-phant"!
What if it were a brontosaurus?
I'd show him who's king of the forest!
How?
How?
Courage!
What makes a king out of a slave? Courage!
What makes the flag on the mast to wave?
Courage!
What makes the elephant charge his tusk in the misty mist or the dusky dusk?
What makes the muskrat guard his musk?
Courage!
What makes the sphinx the Seventh Wonder?
Courage!
What makes the dawn come up like thunder?
Courage!
What makes the Hottentot so hot?
What puts the "ape" in apricot?
What have they got that I ain't got?
Courage!
You can say that again.
The Wizard says go away!
Go away?
Looks like we came a long way for nothing.
And I was so happy.
I thought I was on my way home.
Don't cry.
We're gonna get you to the Wizard.
We certainly are.
Auntie Em was so good to me and I never appreciated it.
Running away and hurting her feelings.
Professor Marvel said she was sick.
She may be dying and it's all my fault.
I'll never forgive myself.
Never, never, never.
Please don't cry anymore.
I'll get you into the Wizard somehow.
Come on. I had an Aunt Em myself once.
Wait a minute, fellas.
I was just thinking, I really don't want to see the Wizard this much.
I better wait for you outside.
What's the matter?
He's just scared again.
Don't you know the Wizard will give you courage?
I'd be too scared to ask him for it.
Well, then, we'll ask him for you.
I'd sooner wait outside.
Why? Why?
Because I'm still scared!
What happened?
Somebody pulled my tail.
You did it yourself.
Oh. - Here.
Come on.
Come forward!
Tell me when it's over!
Look at that. Look at that!
I wanna go home!
I am Oz the great and powerful!
Who are you?
Who are you?
If you please I am Dorothy the small and meek.
We've come to ask you--
Silence!
Oh! Jiminy crickets!
The great and powerful Oz knows why you have come.
Step forward Tin Man!
You dare to come to me for a heart, do you?
You clinking, clanking, clattering collection of caliginous junk!
Yes, sir.
Yes, Your Honor.
You see a while back, we were walking down the Yellow Brick Road and--
Quiet!
And you, Scarecrow have the effrontery to ask for a brain you billowing bale of bovine fodder!
Yes, Your Honor. I mean, Your Excellency.
I mean, Your Wizardry!
Enough!
And you, Lion!
Well?
You ought to be ashamed of yourself frightening him like that when he came to you for help!
Silence whippersnapper!
The beneficent Oz has every intention of granting your requests.
What's that?
What'd he say? Huh? What'd he say?
But first, you must prove yourselves worthy by performing a very small task.
Bring me the broomstick of the Witch of the West.
But if we do that, we'll have to kill her to get it.
Bring me her broomstick and I'll grant your requests.
Now go!
But what if she kills us first?
I said go!
I'd turn back if I were you."
I believe there's spooks around here.
That's ridiculous! Spooks. That's silly.
Don't you believe in spooks?
No. Why, only- - Oh!
Are you all right?
I do believe in spooks.
I do, I do, I do, I do.
I do believe in spooks. I do, I do, I do, I do, I do!
You'll believe in more than that before I'm finished with you.
Take your army and bring me that girl and her dog.
Do what you like with the others, but I want her alive and unharmed.
They'll give you no trouble. I promise you that.
I've sent a little insect on ahead to take the fight out of them.
Take special care of those slippers. I want those most of all.
Now, fly! Fly!
Bring me that girl and her slippers!
Fly! Fly!
Fly!
Help! Help!
Go away now!
Toto! Toto! Help!
Help! Help! Help!
What happened to you?
They tore my legs off and threw them over there!
Then they took my chest and threw it over there!
That's you all over.
They sure knocked the stuffings out of you.
Don't stand there. Put me together. We've got to find Dorothy!
Now, let's see....
What a nice little dog.
And you, my dear. What an unexpected pleasure.
It's so kind of you to visit me in my loneliness.
What are you gonna do with my dog?
Give him back to me!
All in good time, my little pretty.
All in good time.
Please give me back my dog.
Certainly, certainly when you give me those slippers.
But the Good Witch told me not to.
Very well.
Throw that basket in the river and drown him.
No! Here.
You can have your old slippers, but give me back Toto!
That's a good little girl.
I knew you'd see reason!
I'm sorry! I didn't do it. Can I still have my dog?
Fool that I am, I should have remembered those slippers will never come off as long as you're alive.
But that's not what's worrying me. It's how to do it.
These things must be done delicately or you hurt the spell.
Run, Toto, run!
Catch him, you fool!
Run, Toto, run!
Run, Toto, run!
He got away! He got away!
Which is more than you will!
Drat, you and your dog!
You've been more trouble to me than you're worth.
But it'll soon be over now!
Do you see that?
That's how much longer you've got to be alive. And it isn't long my pretty.
It isn't long!
I can't wait forever to get those shoes!
I'm frightened.
I'm frightened, Auntie Em! I'm frightened.
Dorothy! Dorothy!
Where are you? It's me.
It's Auntie Em.
We're trying to find you. Where are you?
I'm here in Oz, Auntie Em.
I'm locked up in the Witch's castle and I'm trying to get home to you, Auntie Em!
Oh, Auntie Em, don't go away!
I'm frightened! Come back! Come back!
Auntie Em, Auntie Em! Come back!"
I'll give you Auntie Em, my pretty!
There's Toto. Where'd he come from?
He's come to take us to Dorothy.
Come on, fellas!
I hope my strength holds out.
I hope your tail holds out.
What's that? What's that?
That's the castle of the Wicked Witch.
Dorothy's in that awful place?
I hate to think of her in there.
We've got to get her out.
Don't cry now.
We haven't got the oilcan, and you've been squeaking enough as it is.
Who's them? Who's them?
I've got a plan how to get in there.
Fine. He's got a plan.
And you're gonna lead us.
Yeah.
Me?
Yes, you.
I gotta get her out of there?
That's right.
All right, I'll go in there for Dorothy.
Wicked Witch or no Wicked Witch guards or no guards, I'll tear them apart.
I may not come out alive, but I'm going in there.
There's only one thing I want you to do.
What's that?
Talk me out of it.
No, you don't!
Oh, no.
Now, wait a minute. - Up!
Come on, I've got another idea.
Do you think it would be polite dropping in like this?
Where do we go now?
Yeah.
There!
Wait! We better make sure. Dorothy, are you in there?
It's us!
Yes!
It's me!
She's locked me in!
We gotta get her out! Open the door!
Oh, hurry! Please hurry!
The hourglass is almost empty!
Stand back!
Oh, Toto!
Toto! Oh, Lion!
I knew you'd come! I knew you would!
Hurry, we've got no time to lose!
Going so soon?
I wouldn't hear of it.
Why, my little party's just beginning.
Trapped. Trapped like mice...rats.
That's right. Don't hurt them right away.
We'll let them think about it a little first.
Seize them!
Seize them!
Stop them, you fools!
Stop them!
Seize them! Seize them!
There they go! Now we've got them!
Half of you go this way, half of you go that way.
Hurry! Hurry!
Where do we go now?
This way. Come on!
Back! Back!
Well!
Ring around the rosie, a pocket full of spears!
Thought you'd be pretty foxy, didn't you?
The last to go will see the first three go before her.
And her mangy little dog too!
How about a little fire, Scarecrow?
No! No! No!
Help! I'm burning!
I'm burning!
It's burning! Help!
Don't throw that water!
Aah! You cursed brat!
Look what you've done!
I'm melting!
Melting!
Oh, what a world! What a world!
Who would've thought a good little girl like you could destroy my beautiful wickedness?
Aah! Look out! Look out!
I'm going.
She's dead. You've killed her.
I didn't mean to kill her. Really, I didn't.
It's just that he was on fire.
Hail to Dorothy! The Wicked Witch is dead!
Hail! Hail to Dorothy!
The Wicked Witch is dead!
The broom.
May we have it? - Please.
And take it with you.
Oh, thank you so much!
Now we can go tell the Wizard the Wicked Witch is dead!
The Wicked Witch is dead!
Can I believe my eyes?
Why have you come back?
Please, sir. We've done what you told us.
We've brought you the broomstick of the Wicked Witch of the West.
We melted her.
Ah, you liquidated her, eh?
Very resourceful.
Yes, sir.
So we'd like you to keep your promise to us, if you please, sir.
Not so fast. Not so fast!
I'll have to give the matter a little thought.
Go away and come back tomorrow.
Tomorrow?
Oh, but I wanna go home now!
You've had plenty of time already.
Yeah.
Do not arouse the wrath of the great and powerful Oz!
I said come back tomorrow!
If you were really great and powerful, you'd keep your promises.
Do you presume to criticize the great Oz?
You ungrateful creatures!
Think yourselves lucky that I'm giving you audience tomorrow instead of 20 years from now!
The great Oz has spoken!
Pay no attention to that man behind the curtain.
The great and--
Oz has spoken.
Who are you?
I am the great and powerful Wizard of Oz.
You are?
I don't believe you.
I'm afraid it's true. There's no other Wizard except me.
You humbug!
Yeah.
Yes, that's exactly so. I'm a humbug. - Oh.
You're a very bad man!
Oh, no, my dear. I'm a very good man.
I'm just a very bad wizard.
What about the heart you promised Tin Man?
And the courage you promised Cowardly Lion?
And Scarecrow's brain?
And Scarecrow's brain?
Why, anybody can have a brain. That's a very mediocre commodity.
Every pusillanimous creature that crawls on the earth or slinks through slimy seas has a brain.
Back where I come from, we have universities seats of great learning, where men go to become great thinkers.
They think deep thoughts, and with no more brains than you have.
But they have one thing you haven't got. A diploma.
Therefore, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Universitatus Committeeatum E Pluribus Unum I hereby confer upon you...
...the honorary degree of Th.D.
Th.D.?
That's Doctor of Thinkology.
The sum of the square roots of two sides of an isosceles triangle is equal to the square root of the remaining side.
Oh, joy! Rapture!
I've got a brain!
How can I thank you enough?
Well, you can't.
As for you, my fine friend, you're a victim of disorganized thinking.
You are under the delusion that because you run away from danger you have no courage.
You're confusing courage with wisdom.
Back where I come from, we have men who are called "heroes."
Once a year, they take their fortitude out of mothballs and parade it down the main street.
And they have no more courage than you have.
But they have one thing that you haven't got. A medal.
Therefore for meritorious conduct, extraordinary valor conspicuous bravery against wicked witches I award you the Triple Cross.
You are now a member of the Legion of Courage.
Shucks, folks, I'm speechless.
As for you, my galvanized friend, you want a heart.
You don't know how lucky you are not to have one.
Hearts will never be practical until they can be made unbreakable.
But I still want one.
Back where I come from, there are men who do nothing all day but good deeds.
They are called phil--
Good-deed-doers. And their hearts are no bigger than yours.
But they have one thing you haven't got. A testimonial.
Therefore, in consideration of your kindness I take pleasure at this time in presenting you with a small token of our esteem and affection.
And remember, my sentimental friend that a heart is not judged by how much you love but by how much you are loved by others.
Oh! It ticks!
Listen! Look, it ticks!
Read what my medal says.
Courage."
Ain't it the truth! Ain't it the truth!
Oh, they're all wonderful.
Hey, what about Dorothy?
Yes, how about Dorothy?
Yeah. Dorothy next.
I don't think there's anything in that black bag for me.
You force me into a cataclysmic decision.
The only way to get Dorothy to Kansas is for me to take her myself.
Oh, will you?
Could you? Oh!
But are you clever enough to manage it?
Child, you cut me to the quick!
I'm an old Kansas man myself, born and bred in the western wilderness, premier balloonist par excellence to the Miracle Wonderland Carnival Company.
Until one day, while performing feats of stratospheric skill never before attempted by civilized man an unfortunate phenomena occurred.
It did?
Weren't you frightened?
You are talking to a man who has laughed in the face of death sneered at doom and chuckled at catastrophe.
Suddenly the wind changed and the balloon floated down into this noble city where I was instantly acclaimed Oz, the first wizard deluxe!
Times being what they were, I accepted the job retaining my balloon against the advent of a quick getaway.
And in that balloon, dear Dorothy you and I will return to the land of E Pluribus Unum.
My friends. I mean, my friends!
This is positively the finest exhibition ever to be shown be that as it may.
I, your Wizard per ardua ad alta am about to embark upon a hazardous and technically unexplainable journey into the outer stratosphere!
To confer, converse and otherwise hobnob with my brother wizards.
And I hereby decree that until what time if any, that I return the Scarecrow, by virtue of his highly superior brains shall rule in my stead assisted by the Tin Man, by virtue of his magnificent heart and the Lion, by virtue of his courage.
Obey them as you would me. Thank you.
Oh, Toto!
Come back! Toto!
Toto! Don't go without me. I'll be right back.
Stop that dog!
This is a highly irregular procedure. This is absolutely unprecedented!
Ruined my exit!
Come back! Come back!
Don't go without me! Please come back!
I can't come back! I don't know how it works!
Goodbye, folks!
Goodbye!
Oh, now I'll never get home.
Stay with us then, Dorothy.
We all love you.
We don't want you to go.
That's very kind of you but this could never be like Kansas.
Auntie Em must have stopped wondering what happened to me by now.
Oh, Scarecrow, what am I going to do?
Look!
Here's someone who can help you!
Will you help me?
Can you help me?
You don't need help any longer.
You've always had the power to go back to Kansas.
I have?
Then why didn't you tell her before?
Because she wouldn't have believed me. She had to learn it for herself.
What have you learned, Dorothy?
Well....
I think that it--
That it wasn't enough just to want to see Uncle Henry and Auntie Em.
And it's that if I ever go looking for my heart's desire again I won't look any further than my own back yard because if it isn't there I never really lost it to begin with.
Is that right?
That's all it is.
But that's so easy! I should've thought of it for you.
I should've felt it in my heart.
She had to find it out for herself.
Now those magic slippers will take you home in two seconds.
Toto too?
Toto too.
Now?
Whenever you wish.
Oh, dear. That's too wonderful to be true!
Oh, it's....
It's gonna be so hard to say goodbye.
I love you all too.
Goodbye, Tin Man.
Oh, don't cry.
You'll rust so dreadfully.
Here. Here's your oilcan.
Goodbye.
Now I know I've got a heart because it's breaking.
Goodbye, Lion.
I know it isn't right but I'm gonna miss the way you used to holler for help before you found your courage.
I would never have found it if it hadn't been for you.
I think I'll miss you most of all.
Are you ready now?
Yes.
Say goodbye, Toto.
Yes, I'm ready now.
Then close your eyes and tap your heels together three times and think to yourself:
There's no place like home.
There's no place like home."
There's no place like home.
There's no place like home.
There's no place like home.
There's no place like home.
There's no place like home.
There's no place like home.
There's no place like home.
Wake up, honey.
There's no place like home.
There's no place like home.
There's no....
Dorothy, dear. It's Aunt Em, darling.
Oh, Auntie Em, it's you!
Yes, darling.
Hello there!
Anybody home?
I dropped by because I heard the little girl got caught in the big--
Well, she seems all right now.
She got quite a bump on the head. We kind of thought she was gonna leave us.
But I did leave you. That's just the trouble.
And I tried to get back for days!
There, there, lie quiet now.
You just had a bad dream.
Sure.
Remember me your old pal, Hunk?
And me, Hickory?
You couldn't forget my face, could you?
No. But it wasn't a dream. It was a place.
And you and you and you...
...and you were there.
Oh. Ha, ha. Sure.
But you couldn't have been, could you?
We dream lots of silly things when we--
No, Aunt Em, this was a real, truly live place.
And I remember that some of it wasn't very nice but most of it was beautiful.
But just the same, all I kept saying to everybody was, "I want to go home!"
And they sent me home.
Doesn't anybody believe me?
Of course we believe you, Dorothy.
But anyway, Toto, we're home!
Home!
And this is my room and you're all here.
And I'm not going to leave here ever, ever again because I love you all.
And oh, Auntie Em there's no place like home!
I tell you that Andrew Jackson, that great volcano at Washington, is belching forth a lava of political corruption which is sweeping over the length and breadth of this land, leaving unscathed no green spot, no living thing.
Sangamon County, take warning.
Send me, John T. Stuart, back to the legislature, and I'll see that every Jackson man in office is whipped out of the place like a dog out of a meat house!
And now, my friends,
I bow to one of your own citizens of New Salem who will address you further on behalf of the great and incorruptible Whig Party,
God bless it.
Gentlemen and fellow citizens,
I presume you all know who I am.
I'm plain Abraham Lincoln.
I've been solicited by many friends to become a candidate for the legislature.
My politics are short and sweet like the old woman's dance.
I'm in favor of a national bank, of the internal improvement system, and high protective tariff.
These are my sentiments and political principles.
If elected, I shall be thankful.
If not, it'll be all the same.
Hey, Abe!
Somebody wants to do business with you.
Howdy, ma'am.
Howdy. - Howdy.
How you been making out?
We ain't hit the hard places yet.
Won't you get down and rest yourself?
Well, thank you. We was aimin' to stretch a bit. My old woman figured on gettin' some flannel for shirts.
I reckon that could be arranged.
Yeah, but... we ain't got any money.
Well, you can send it to me.
We don't aim to ask for no credit.
If it'll ease your mind any, ma'am, the whole shebang here's worked on credit.
That's right, Abe.
Berry and me never put up a penny to start with. From the way things look we never will.
Well, there's an old barrel in the wagon that might be worth 50 cents to some folks.
Of course, there ain't much in it. Just some old things laying around the house, along with some books that belonged to my grandpappy.
Books?
Yeah, in the last barrel.
Well, you folks go in the store and help yourself. I'll go on back and get the barrel.
Blackstone's Commentaries.
That's law.
Hardly a thumb mark on it either.
No, sir. We took mighty good care of it.
Reckon you can read it, sir?
I expect I could make head or tails out of it, if I set my mind to it.
Law.
Law.
That's the rights of persons and the rights of things.
The rights of life, reputation and liberty.
The rights to acquire and hold property.
Wrongs are violations of those rights."
By jing, that's all there is to it. Right and wrong.
Maybe I ought to begin to take this up serious.
Hello, Mr. Lincoln.
Well, hello, Ann.
Give me a minute to try and untangle myself.
Aren't you afraid you'll put your eyes out reading like that upside-down?
Trouble is, Ann, when I'm standin' up my mind's lyin' down. When I'm lyin' down, my mind's standin' up.
Of course, allowin' I got a mind.
You've a wonderful mind, Abe, and you know it.
River's sure pretty today, ain't it?
You think a lot about things, don't you?
Well, my brain gets to itchin' inside sometimes, I gotta scratch it.
Father says you've a real head on your shoulders, and a way with people too.
He says it's not all just making them laugh. They remember what you say because it's got sense to it.
Mr. Rutledge is a mighty fine man, Ann, but if you ask me,
I'm more like the old horse the fella's tryin' to sell.
Sound of skin and skeleton and free from faults and faculties.
I know how smart you are.
How ambitious you are too.
Ambitious?
You are, deep down underneath. Even if you won't admit it.
Gotta have education these days to get anywhere.
I never went to school so much as a year in my whole life.
Oh, but you've educated yourself.
You've read poetry and Shakespeare and... and now law.
I just had my heart set on your going over to Jacksonville to college when I go to the seminary there and...
You're mighty pretty, Ann.
Some folks I know don't like red hair.
I do.
Do you, Abe?
I love red hair.
Pretty, aren't they?
Got 'em up at Bowling Green's place.
You never saw anything like 'em in your life, sittin' there in the snow like scared rabbits.
Bet the woods are full of 'em too.
Snow's nice, ain't it, the way it's driftin'.
Ice is breakin' up.
Well, Ann, I'm still up a tree. Just can't seem to make up my mind what to do.
Maybe I ought to go into the law, take my chances.
I admit, I got kinda a taste for somethin' different than this in my mouth.
Still, I don't know.
I'd feel such a fool, settin' myself up as a-knowin' so much.
Course, I know what you'd say. I've been hearin' it every day, over and over again.
Go on, Abe. Make somethin' of yourself. You got friends.
Oh, yes, I know what you'd say.
But I don't know.
Ann, I'll tell you what I'll do.
I'll let this stick decide.
If it falls back toward me, then I stay here, as I always have.
If it falls forward towards you then it's...
Well, it's the law.
Here goes, Ann.
Well, Ann, you win.
Wonder if I could've tipped it your way just a little.
Hello, Abe. What are you doin' in Springfield?
Figurin' on settin' myself up as a lawyer.
What do you know about law, Abe?
Not enough to hurt me.
You did, durn ya! You did!
That's a lie!
I can prove it, I tell ya!
Then go ahead!
I got the law on my side!
I'll show ya, y- you... you durned thief!
Ah, gentlemen, just hold your horses and sit down.
Now, Brother Woolridge?
Yes, sir?
Brother Hawthorne here says you agreed to furnish him two yokes of oxen to break up 20 acres of prairie sod ground.
He did such.
And that were to allow him to raise a crop of corn on another piece of land.
That's right.
But he never done one thing he promised. Not one!
He claims further that when he talked to you about these promises you did strike, beat and knock him down pluck, pull and tear large quantities of hair from his head
and that with stick or fists you did strike him many blows on or about the face, head, breast, back, shoulders, hips... and diverse other parts of the body and with violence did push, thrust and gouge your fingers in his eyes.
Yeah. I got witnesses to prove it.
And for that he demands $250 damages.
Yes, I do.
Well, Brother Woolridge, what you got to say to that?
You forgot to put in there about me whoppin' him with a neck yoke.
Now, it says here, Brother Hawthorne, that you owe Brother Woolridge $55.47 board at the rate of a dollar and a half a week.
You owe him $90 for use of a team and wagon for eight months besides $100 cash on a loan.
Yeah.
Well, I never said I didn't.
Well, I ain't no lightnin' calculator, but accordin' to my figurin',
you owe him 245 dollars and 47 cents.
You're askin' $250 damages.
Now, my idea's to split the difference of $4.53
which, by a strange coincidence, happens to be exactly the amount of my legal fee.
And the whole thing's settled.
Well, what do you say?
I won't do it!
Me either! I'll go to law first.
Gentlemen, did you ever hear about the time in the Black Hawk War when I... butted two fellas' heads together and busted both of 'em?
Well, I'm willin' if he is.
'Tain't fair, but I'll do it just to be shut of him.
Thanks, gentlemen.
Well, that's gonna save us all a heap of legal trouble and headaches.
Well, if you'd just give me my and Stuart's share, I'll mosey along over and see the parade.
It's gonna be a heap of yellin' and carryin' on.
It's gonna be quite a pleasure to listen to after this.
Yessiree, Bob.
Yessiree, Bob.
Here comes Lily!
Hey, Ma!
Hey, Lily!
I'll have my flapjacks well done, Lily! Buckwheat cakes!
Buckwheat cakes, Lily!
1776.
Yep. Them's the veterans of the revolution.
Mornin', Miss Edwards.
Good morning.
Ninian.
Mornin', Mr. Douglas.
Mr. Lincoln.
How are you, Miss Ricketts?
Nice parade, Ninian.
Mary, this is Mr. Abraham Lincoln.
This is my sister, who's just come up from Lexington to visit us... Miss Mary Todd.
Mr. Lincoln, I've been hearing some mighty fine things about you.
Mustn't believe everything Douglas here says about me. We kinda straddle different political fences.
Oh, but I haven't been discussing you with any other gentlemen. My sisters told me about you.
You're in the legislature, aren't you?
If you put that in the past tense, I'll plead guilty. I was in the legislature.
Mr. Lincoln's practicing law with John Stuart, my opponent for Congress.
That's a mighty flatterin' way he puts it, ma'am, when what I'm really doin' is wearin' a hole in Stuart's best rocking chair.
First I thought it was that apple, for sure.
Then I sank my teeth into that peach, and...
I just couldn't seem to make up my mind.
So I sample the apple again.
Hey, you all can't do that to me.
Aw, go on back to that!
What is it?
It's a pie-judging contest, Ma.
I should've brung one of my sweet potato pies.
You sure should, Miss Clay.
You'd sure win.
I wish you had, Miss Clay. They're so good!
Look!
Yes, he is!
By the time I get the apple down, the peach is smellin' so good I'm sure it's the best.
So it goes.
First one, then the other.
The Hog Wallow Boys, undefeated champions of Sangamon County, led by Buck Troup!
The Speed County Demons, led by Efe Tyler!
Ready!
One, two, three, go!
Leave my wife alone.
Who, me?
If you ain't lookin' for trouble, get away from here.
Adam! Matt!
You'd better look out, Scrub. - You're gonna get hurt.
What are you gonna use on me?
Knives, or pistols, or your fists?
We ain't botherin' nobody. We're just here to have a good time, so you please to leave us alone. - Come on now, Matt.
Come on, Adam. - Come on, Scrub. We got plenty of time later.
Bye, honey.
Adam, you got to promise me somethin'.
You got to promise me we'll come to town every single year we're livin'. You just got to, Adam!
You just say that now. You wait till we're married and have babies to tend to. - That'll be different.
No, it won't neither. Matt and Sarah have a baby, and they came.
Yeah, but maybe we'll have lots of babies.
Maybe we'll have twins, uh, or somethin'.
I don't care.
I don't care if we have 50 babies. Oh, Adam, you got to promise me.
All right, Carrie Sue, I promise.
Adam, I wished we was married right now, like... like Sarah and Matt.
I been meaning to talk to your family about us soon as we get home.
Did you honest, Adam?
Oh, Adam!
Adam, let's go back. Let's hurry, 'fore they light the tar barrels, huh?
All right. Only I wish it was gonna be that fella splittin' them rails again. - I do, for a fact!
Now, you folks go along. - I'll sit with her.
You go, Ma. It's my place to stay.
You and Matt go. - You go on.
We're goin' over yonder!
Let me get my coat! - Shh!
Hey, Matt, how 'bout a nip before we go?
Go along, the four of you. Miss Clay, I wish you was goin' with us.
Honest, I do. I've seen so much now, I'm fit to pop. Now, be careful and don't get into any trouble, like I told you.
Miss Clay! Miss Clay! Miss Clay!
They're fightin'!
That man... he came back!
He's drunk!
Where are they? - Over yonder, in that clearin' over there.
I'm going with you!
No! You and Sarah stay with the baby!
He's got a gun! He's going to kill Matt! I know he will!
Oh, the baby! Miss Clay!
Stay right in that clinch there!
Come on! - Adam! Matt!
Come on, Matt!
Adam! Matt! - Stay on top of him, Matt!
That's it! Come on, Matt!
Roll right over the top of him! Stay in the clinch, I tell ya!
Look out! He's got a rock! Adam!
Adam!
Come on! That's it! Come on now!
Ma! - Ma.
Cass...
Scrub. Scrub!
Cass...
He's dead.
Dead?
Lord have mercy on us.
Cut him right in the heart with this knife.
Get the sheriff.
Ma...
Get the sheriff.
Hey! Come over here, somebody!
There's been a murder!
Matt!
Adam!
Murder! Come over here, somebody! There's been a murder!
Look! Scrub White! - Stuck right through the heart!
Sheriff, it's Scrub White! He's dead! Scrub White!
How'd it happen?
It was them two fellas over there. They was fightin' with Scrub.
They cut him.
Which one of you fellas this knife here belong to?
Me. - No, me.
I want the truth.
Which one of you cut him?
I did. - That ain't so.
I did it. - It was me!
He came after me with a gun. One of you is lyin'.
Now, which one is it?
Which one is it?
I reckon I did.
Who are you?
Their mother.
Well? Which one was it?
I ain't sayin'.
Well, don't make no difference anyhow. Under the law, they're both equally guilty.
You're under arrest.
Palmer Cass, I appoint you temporary deputy. Help me get these fellas down to the jail.
Take 'em out now. - Adam, tell them you didn't do it!
You and Jake stay here and take care of the body and this here knife.
Don't let nobody touch nothin' till I get back.
Two against one! That's what I don't like!
Yeah, and stabbing him right in the back too!
What they need is a little taste of the rope.
Well, what are we waitin' for?
Miss Clay, stop 'em!
They're gonna lynch 'em, Abe.
Come on.
We gotta hurry.
I'm your lawyer, ma'am.
Open it up, Sheriff! Let me outta here!
I can't! I can't!
They're gonna break in! - Don't be a fool! They'll get us too!
Can't help it!
Hold on! Listen to me!
Get out of there, Lincoln!
Put down that pole and listen to me!
Get out of the way!
Put down that pole and listen to me!
Get out of the way!
By jing, I said listen to me, and by jing, you will!
Now, gentlemen, I'm not up here to make any speeches.
All I got to say is, I can lick any man here hands down.
Come on, men! Come on! We gonna let that man stand in our way?
Hold on, Buck!
I thought I'd find that big mouth of yours around here, tellin' people what to do.
I'm Big Buck, all right. I'm the biggest buck in this lick.
Well, come on up and whet your horns.
Well, what's that got to do with us? Are you gonna move? Get away, Lincoln!
All jokin' aside.
Let's look at this matter from my side.
Why, you all know I'm just a fresh lawyer tryin' to get ahead.
But some of you boys act like you wanna do me out of my first clients.
Go ahead. I'm not sayin' you fellas are not right.
Maybe these boys do deserve to hang.
But with me handlin' their case, don't look like you'll have much to worry about on that score.
All I'm asking is to have it done with some legal pomp and show.
That's all right, Abe.
How 'bout our side of it?
We've gone to a heap of trouble not to have at least one hangin'!
Sure you have, Mac. And if these boys had more than one life, I'd say go ahead.
Maybe a little hangin' mightn't do 'em any harm.
But the sort of hangin' you boys'd give 'em would be so... so permanent.
Trouble is, when men start takin' the law into their own hands, they're just as apt, in all the confusion and fun, to start hangin' somebody who's not a murderer as somebody who is.
Then the next thing you know, they're hangin' one another just for fun till it gets to the place a man can't pass a tree or look at a rope without feelin' uneasy.
We seem to lose our heads in times like this.
We do things together that we'd be mighty ashamed to do by ourselves.
For instance, you take Jeremiah Carter yonder.
There's not a finer, more decent, God-fearing man in Springfield than Jeremiah Carter.
And I wouldn't be surprised if, when he goes home, he takes down a certain book and looks into it.
Maybe he'll just happen to hit on these words...
Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy."
Why don't you put it down for a spell, boys? Ain't it gettin' heavy?
That's all I've got to say, friends.
Good night.
Nice pair of mules you got here, ma'am.
You won't let nothin' happen to Adam and Matt.
Don't you worry about a thing.
I'll keep my eye on 'em, all right.
Matt, he don't eat much at all, but Adam's just a boy... he's sure to get hungry.
Well, they'll get plenty with the sheriff's wife in the kitchen.
I, uh... I ain't one to talk much, but after what you've done for us tonight...
Now, now. Save your thanks.
Course, you know I'm just a sort of jackleg lawyer without much experience in this business.
But as long as you want me, I'll do the best I can.
Still, you might feel a lot safer if my partner was here.
Or you could get Steve Douglas.
We don't know nothin' about lawyers or that kind of thing.
Well, at any rate, I'll drop around in the morning and have a little talk with the boys.
One of these days I'll take a ride into the country and let you ladies know how things are comin'.
You know, my mother, Nancy Hanks, would be just about your age if she was alive.
Got an idea she'd be a whole lot like you too.
A whole lot like you.
Well, good-bye, ma'am. Watch out for the ruts.
Get along, mule.
Upon my word, ma'am, in all my experience, I've never danced with a more graceful and charming partner.
Thank you so much.
I'm awfully glad you don't share Mr. Lincoln's aversion to feminine society.
Well, Mr. Lincoln's a great storyteller.
Like all such actors, he revels in boisterous applause.
And yet Ninian says it was his wit that saved those two wretched boys.
Yes, unquestionably he has ability in handling an unthinking mob.
Not even his enemies deny he has a certain political talent.
Uh, Mr. Lincoln, are you, by any chance, a member of the well-known Lincoln family of Massachusetts?
Not by any chance I know of, sir.
A very fine family, sir. Very fine.
Then I'd say the evidence is all against us belongin' to it.
No Lincoln I ever knew amounted to a hill of beans.
Mr. Lincoln, in the part of the South I come from it's customary for a gentleman to ask a visiting lady to dance.
I'd like to dance with you the worst way, ma'am, but since all the dancin' I've ever done was behind a plow, I...
Mr. Lincoln, I shall be very glad to dance this dance with you.
Mr. Lincoln, at least you're a man of honor. You said you wanted to dance with me the worst way, and I must say you've kept your word...
that was the worst way I've ever seen.
I warned you, ma'am.
Should we go outside and talk instead of dancing, Mr. Lincoln?
I'd be delighted, ma'am.
Well, Mr. Lincoln, what are you up to now?
Got the smell of the country in my nose just ridin' out.
If a client comes by, Abe, where will we tell him you're at?
In my office, of course.
Where is your office, Abe?
In my hat!
Abe, you sure love that river, don't you?
It's a mighty pretty river, Efe.
Never saw a man like you look at a river like you do.
Folks'd think it was a pretty woman or somethin', the way you carry on.
How come they call that thing you're playin' a Jew's harp?
Comes down from David's harp in the Bible.
I don't wanna say nothin' against the Bible, but those people back there sure had funny taste in music.
What's that tune you're playin'?
Don't know.
Makes you wanna march or somethin'.
I reckon that's plenty.
People used to say I could sink an ax deeper than anybody they ever saw.
Well, that's still not bad for a city feller.
This house certainly takes me back to the time when... I was just a little old shirt-tailed boy in Kentucky.
Our place was just about this size too.
One window, I remember, and a dirt floor.
Some wild crab apple trees out in the front yard.
And a big hearth inside where I used to stretch out while my mother read to me.
I'll never forget how bad I felt the day we decided to pull up stakes and head for Indiana.
Kentucky's a mighty fine place to live, but with all the slaves coming in white folks had a hard time making a livin'.
And you folks just like my folks.
I said that to myself the minute I laid eyes on you.
My mother'd feel right at home with Mrs. Clay," I said. Now I know she would.
Sarah, I bet you didn't know I had a sister once, just about your age.
Named Sarah too.
Only she died when her baby was born.
And I knew a girl like you, Carrie Sue, named Ann.
Ann died too.
Well, finished reading your letters yet?
I read mine, by myself too.
I never learned to read yet.
I thought maybe you'd read it to me.
Why, certainly. I'll be glad to.
Dear Ma, I seat myself this evening to inform you that I and Matt are well and hoping these few lines may find you all enjoying the same blessings.
We had turnip greens and pork chops for supper.
But, oh, me! Nobody can cook turnip greens like you, Ma."
Matt always says nobody can cook turnip greens better than me.
Sarah can cook 'em as good as anyone.
We've been treated mighty nice.
The sheriff says he never had anybody in here who could beat me playing checkers.
Well, Ma, I bet you wish we were there to do some plowing and laying in fresh meat.
Oh, me! Wouldn't a squirrel stew taste good?"
Them boys were great ones for hunting.
A preacher comes in regular and reads us the Bible.
I'm fixing to learn me a whole psalm, if I don't get hung first.
Well, my pen is bad, my ink is pale, my love for you will never fail. Adam."
Sarah, do you suppose you've got an extra piece of paper in the house?
I want to make some notes while I'm talking to your mother.
We ain't got any paper that I know of, but we got a new almanac.
Reckon you could write on it? - Almanac? Why, yes, it's just the thing.
Carrie Sue, my mouth's beginning to water for some of those turnip greens.
Honest?
Do you think there's anything you can do about that?
Yeah! Sarah and me'll fix some together.
Thanks, Sarah.
Now, then, suppose you tell me somethin' about the boys.
Well, there ain't very much to tell.
Your husband... did he die?
Yes. The summer after we got here.
We just finished building the house.
It's a fine house, all right. Not a nail in it.
No, he was mighty good with his hands.
He was killed by a drunk Indian.
It was 'long round sundown.
I was just coming back from milking.
Adam was clearing out the timber, and Matt was down with a fever.
That Adam... I'll bet he knew what to do with an ax.
Yeah. He takes after his father.
Matt was always the puny one.
Why, once when he was a baby, I... I held him for two days while he was burning up with lung sickness.
Mrs. Clay, which one of your boys killed Scrub White?
I can't tell you. I just can't.
But I'm your lawyer.
I don't want to scare you, but we've got an awful fight on our hands.
I can't.
Be just like choosing between 'em.
What do you suppose made 'em both say they done it?
Matt did because he's older, and Adam said so because Matt has a wife and baby.
There are a lot of people'd like to see those boys hang.
I know, but I...
I just can't.
They've got a pack of witnesses and a lot of mighty fine lawyers on the other side.
It ain't no use. I can't.
No, I don't reckon you can.
Better take them in the back door, Sheriff.
Order! Quiet! Quiet!
Order! Order!
Take off your hats!
Put them jugs away.
Huh. Mighty big crowd here today.
All right, Mr. Clerk.
Oyez, oyez, oyez. The honorable court of the Eighth Judicial Circuit of the State of Illinois is now in session.
Judge Herbert A. Bell presiding.
Is the State ready, Mr. Felder?
May it please the court, the State of Illinois is ready... ready and waiting, sir.
Then go ahead, gentlemen, and pick yourselves a jury.
So your name's Bill Killian?
You don't like my clients, do you, Bill?
Well, tell me this.
You any kin to old Jake Killian, used to live down in New Salem?
Why, yes, sir. I'm his son.
Well, Bill, if you take after your dad, you're a smart boy and an honest one too.
Reckon he's all right with us, Your Honor.
Clarence, how you stand on capital punishment?
You mean, do I want to see them two fellas hung?
You're a blacksmith, aren't you?
Well, there's going to be a heap of horseshoein' around here this week.
I wouldn't want to keep you from your job.
You're excused. - Get going, Clarence.
You say you've never discussed this case?
No, sir, I never did.
Ever hear anybody else discuss it?
How long you been a barber in this town?
Oh, about 18 years, goin' on.
And you never heard it mentioned?
No, sir, not that I remember.
Do you know the, uh, gentleman who's prosecuting this case, Mr. Felder?
I guess I know him.
Then you're excused.
Your Honor, this is a waste of time.
Mr. Lincoln should know that the mere fact that a prospective juror knows counsel for the State does not disqualify him.
I know that, John.
What I'm afraid of is that some of the jurors might not know you, and that'd put me at a great disadvantage.
Order! Order! Order!
Nipped you then, John.
Sam Boone!
Sam Boone!
Guilty.
No, no, Sam. Sit down.
You drink liquor, Sam?
Cuss?
Go to church regular?
Enjoy hangings?
Got a job?
Just like to loaf, huh?
Ever tell a lie?
Well, you're just the kind of honest man we want on this jury.
Take your place.
All right, Mr. Prosecutor.
Gentlemen of the jury,
Thou shalt not kill."
So says the sixth Commandment as handed down to Moses on Mouth Sinai by the Lord God of Israel himself.
Thou shalt not kill.
But Matt and Adam Clay did not heed that command.
They killed Scrub White.
Two against one, they came at him with their deadly weapons.
Two against one, and that one a peace-loving servant of the law.
From all I hear, Scrub was doing some might fancy fightin' for a peace-lovin' man.
True, Mr. Lincoln! True!
For Scrub White was a man, an American, in whose veins flowed the blood of pioneers who braved the wilderness to make this great state what it is.
He fought in self-defense as he would have fought against the wild beasts of the forest, for...
Scrub White loved life.
He loved the blue of God's heaven, the soft caress of the south wind.
He loved life, but he is dead.
And there, gentlemen... there sit his murderers!
I tell you, gentlemen, they must be wiped out as a man wipeth a plate!
Order! Order! Quiet!
Come, come, men! You've got to give the boys a fair trial, a jury trial, before you hang 'em.
Get going, John.
John, it's a pure shame you aren't runnin' for congress or somethin'.
Or are you runnin' for congress or somethin'?
No, Mr. Lincoln.
I'm here for the sole purpose of seeing justice done.
Justice!
My error.
Sure a spellbinder from way back.
As attorney for the State of Illinois, gentlemen,
I shall prove that by their own confessions the defendants did stab unto death the deceased.
I shall prove that they were under the influence of an alcoholic beverage at the time.
And... when I have proven these facts, gentlemen,
I expect you, as 12 loyal, intelligent, red-blooded citizens to find Adam and Matt Clay guilty of murder.
Quiet, please. - Quiet! Quiet!
Call Sheriff Billings.
Hi, Gil.
Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole truth...
I do.
Sheriff, have you ever seen this knife before?
Yes, sir. That's the knife they killed Scrub White with.
Did you see 'em do it with a knife?
No, but I...
I just wanted to get you back in your groove. Go ahead.
Your Honor, I must insist, if the learned counsel for the defense wishes to object, let him address the court, not my witness.
You heard that, Abe.
One thing more, Sheriff. Did you visit the wagon owned by the defendants?
Yes, sir.
Yes?
And then what did you find there?
A jug of liquor about three-quarters full.
Did the boys deny they'd been drinking on the night of the crime?
No, sir. They said they'd had a snort or two, as usual.
As usual."
Yes, sir. That's what they said. "As usual."
Thank you, Sheriff.
Your witness.
Where's the jug now?
In my jail.
Empty?
Well, there's some left.
How much?
About one-fourth full.
Who drank it?
Well...
Never mind.
That'll be our little secret.
Tell me this... Did Scrub White have a pistol?
He was a deputy. He had to have one.
Do you know if he tried to use it on the defendants?
No, sir.
You don't know he didn't.
No, sir.
Sheriff, did you ever hear about the fix a man was in when he was comin' down the road with a pitchfork on his shoulder and a farmer's dog ran out and bit him on the leg?
No, sir. That must have been out of my district.
Well, then you probably don't recall that in defending himself he stuck one of the prongs of the pitchfork into the dog and killed him.
The farmer got pretty mad.
What made you kill my dog?" he said.
Well, the fellow said, "What made your dog bite me?"
Well," the farmer says, "why didn't you go after him with the other end?"
To which the man replied, "Well, why didn't your dog come at me with the other end?"
Pretty good, Gil.
Abe, tell 'em the one about the mule!
Order! Order!
Get going, Lincoln.
Now, Sheriff, let's just suppose that my two defendants here were like that man with a pitchfork, only, let's say, they've got a knife.
And Scrub White was the farmer's dog, only instead of teeth he's got a pistol.
Well, now, wouldn't you say it was a matter of self-defense to use that blade, so long as Scrub didn't come at 'em with the other end of the pistol?
Your Honor, I object and move that these remarks be stricken from the record.
Counsel is presenting an argument.
The counsel's remarks will be stricken from the record.
The jury will disregard them.
Now, you jurors watch out. Don't remember about that dog.
That's all.
Just a moment.
You don't...
You don't, of your own knowledge, know that Scrub White came at them with the shooting end of the pistol, do you?
No, sir.
Therefore... That's the end the bullets usually come from, isn't it?
Yes, sir.
There... But you didn't see a shot fired, did you?
No, sir.
Then... - But you heard it.
I heard something sounded like a shot.
What do you figure you're best at... seeing or hearing?
Well, both.
That's what I figured.
If you...
Call Palmer Cass.
Palmer Cass, take the stand.
Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you, God?
I do.
What's your name?
J. Palmer Cass.
You knew Scrub White, didn't you?
Sure. I knew him well.
When was the last time you saw him?
The night he was killed.
You had spent a great part of that day with him, hadn't you?
I was with him all day, near abouts.
Tell me, Mr. Cass, just what did you and Mr. White do that day?
Well, we went to the parade first and then to the fairgrounds.
Had supper down at the People's House and went back to the fairgrounds that night.
I see. Yes.
And do you recall... where, and under what circumstances, you first saw the defendants?
We went on down to the tug-o'- war, and there they were.
First thing I knew, they was both cussin' Scrub out and wantin' to fight him.
Why, 'tain't so.
It's a lie, sure enough.
What did Mr. White do then?
Well, he just laughed some more and asked them what they wanted to fight him with... knives, pistols or fists.
And how did he ask that... jokingly?
Oh, sure. He was laughin' all the time.
And that night, Mr. Cass, just before the killing...
Tell the jury what happened then.
Well, Scrub and me had a little argument and he went off by hisself.
The next thing I knew, I heard a shot.
You heard a shot?
Yeah.
I run down there as fast as I could, but by the time I got there
Scrub was layin' on the ground, and them two fellas was standin' over him.
And the knife was on the ground between the defendants?
Yeah. - And where was Mr. White's pistol?
Well, it was in his holster.
It went off, then, while he was trying to get it out of his holster.
Yeah. I guess it did, yeah.
Thank you.
Your witness.
You say your name's J. Palmer Cass?
What's the "J" stand for?
John.
Anybody ever call you Jack?
Why J. Palmer Cass? Why not John P. Cass?
I don't know...
Anything the matter with "John P."?
No, but...
Has J. Palmer Cass anything to conceal?
No.
Then what do you part your name in the middle for?
I got a right to call myself anything I please, as long as it's my own name.
Well, if it's all the same to you, I'll just call you Jack Cass.
Quiet! Quiet! Quiet!
Your Honor! - Quiet! Quiet!
Quiet! - Your Honor!
Your Honor, I object to this ridiculous line of questioning.
Mr. Lincoln's clownishness may win him a laugh from his friends, but I assure him his entire game of buffoonery is lost on this intelligent jury.
Stick to the point, Mr. Lincoln.
I'll do my best, Your Honor.
Well, J. Palmer Cass, you say you and Scrub White had a little argument.
Jackass. I just got it.
What kind of an argument?
I'd rather not say.
Oh, you'd rather not say.
Well, Jack, suppose I told you I'd rather you did say.
All right.
You wanna know, so I'll tell you.
We was arguing about politics.
Well, that's something new to argue about.
I've found out a lot different since, but I said I figured you had more sense in politics than Steve Douglas, and Scrub got mad as a wet hen and said you didn't.
Well, Mr. Cass, I reckon we can let all you said go in till we've heard from my side.
May it please the court, the next witness for the State is not, in the strictest sense, a witness for the prosecution.
However, in the interest of mercy as well as justice, the State desires, at this time, to call upon an eyewitness to the killing of Scrub White.
Mrs. Abigail Clay.
Mrs. Clay.
Don't let 'em.
Tell 'em I did it.
Mrs. Clay.
Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?
The Bible.
Say, "I do."
I do.
Take the stand.
You are the mother of Adam and Matt Clay, aren't you?
You love your boys, don't you?
And you would like to save their lives, if you could.
I'm sure you would, Mrs. Clay.
You were present the night Scrub White was killed, weren't you?
I saw them fighting.
No, no. Don't be afraid of me, Mrs. Clay.
I'm not a bloodthirsty man. I have no desire to see you lose your two boys.
In fact, no man could wish that less.
So, on behalf of the great state of Illinois, on behalf of the People,
I am prepared to offer you the life of one of your sons, provided you tell us which one of your boys stabbed and killed Scrub White.
Don't prompt her, Mr. Lincoln.
Let her answer.
I can't.
Mrs. Clay, you believe in God?
You believe that if you take a sacred oath in the sight of God, and on his holy Bible, that you are bound to speak the truth?
Yes, but I can't. I just can't!
Mrs. Clay, do you appreciate the grave situation your two boys are in?
Don't you know that, under the law, they are equally guilty of murder, that, under the law, they may both be hanged for it?
But I can't tell you, and you can't make me!
Don't you understand? I am offering you the life of one son.
Take it and tell us which boy killed Scrub White.
No.
No!
Don't you know this court can make you answer my question?
Don't you know that you can be sent to jail yourself?
That shielding a criminal makes you an accessory to that crime?
That by your mistaken affection you are deliberately sending both boys to the gallows?
Don't you know...
That's enough of that.
Your Honor, I protest against the prosecution's attempt to force this woman to decide which one of her two sons shall live and which shall die.
In her eyes, these boys hold an equal place.
Perhaps if my learned friend knew more of the law...
I may not know so much of law, Mr. Felder, but I know what's right and what's wrong, and I know what you're asking is wrong.
Put yourself in this woman's place, Your Honor.
Can you truthfully say you'd do differently?
But look at her. She's... She's just a simple, ordinary country woman.
She can't even write her own name.
Yet has she no feelings, no heart?
I've seen Abigail Clay exactly three times in my life, gentlemen, and yet I know everything there is to know about her.
I know her because I've seen hundreds of women just like her, working in the fields, kitchens, hovering over some sick and helpless child.
Women who say little, but do much, who ask for nothin' and give all.
And I tell you that such a woman will never answer the question that's been put to her here.
Never.
I'd rather, Mrs. Clay, see you lose both your boys than to see you break your heart trying to save one at the expense of the other.
So don't tell him.
May it please the court.
To save the jury any more of these harrowing outbursts, the State will withdraw the question and excuse the witness.
No doubt Mr. Lincoln will be glad to hear that she was not the only eyewitness to the murder of Scrub White.
Recall Palmer Cass to the stand.
Mr. Cass, where were you when Scrub White was killed?
I was about a hundred yards away, I reckon.
And you saw the killing with your own eyes?
Yes, sir.
I... I did.
Quiet! Quiet!
Why didn't you tell us this before?
Nobody asked me.
Have you told anybody else about this?
No, sir.
Why not?
I just didn't want to help get nobody hung, that's all.
And that was your only reason... this natural reluctance against being a party to any man's hanging?
Yes, sir.
Why do you tell us now?
I just began to realize that if I don't tell, maybe both of 'em will get hung.
Mr. Cass.
How could you see so clearly from a distance of a hundred yards at 11:00 at night?
Well, it was... it was moon bright.
Moon bright.
Yes, sir.
Then you clearly saw which boy pulled the knife?
Yes, sir.
I did.
The defendants will stand up.
Now, Mr. Cass, tell us. Which defendant stabbed and killed Scrub White?
It was the bigger of the two.
That ain't so!
Adam! Matt!
Quiet! Quiet!
Quiet, quiet!
Clear the court!
Your Honor, the State rests its case.
Quiet!
Quiet! This court is adjourned till tomorrow morning at 9:00.
Sheriff, take the prisoners away!
That's mighty pretty, Matt.
Sorry, folks. You'll have to leave now. We've all got a long, hard day ahead of us tomorrow.
You were discussing your political plans, Mr. Douglas.
Good evening, Judge.
Lincoln, this is against all my principles, but I want to talk to you as an older man.
Go ahead, Judge. I'm listenin'.
What I mean to say, uh, dag-blame it, is, don't you think you ought to have some older lawyer with more experience to help you out tomorrow?
Are you suggesting that I retire, Judge, or just take a back seat?
I'm suggesting, that is, if you want me to, I'll speak to Mr. Douglas and get him to act in a sort of advisory capacity.
I'm sorry, Judge, but I...
I'm just not the sort of fella can swap horses in the middle of a stream.
Then at least change your plea.
Accept sentence for your guilty client, and I'll guarantee the State will be lenient with the other.
Well, that's a mighty temptin' offer.
Mighty temptin', but I... I'm afraid it can't be done.
You see, I promised those folks I'd stick with the game till the last available card was played.
But, man, you'll send both defendants to the gallows as surely as the moon sets.
Maybe. But that's the way it's gotta be.
Good evening, Judge.
Order in the court!
Get going, Lincoln.
Your Honor, the defense wishes, at this time, to... cross-examine the last witness for the State, Palmer Cass.
Palmer Cass.
What's he calling him back for?
Mr. Cass, yesterday you identified Matt Clay as the killer of Scrub White.
Yes, sir, I did.
You're sure of that?
Why, sure, I'm sure.
Well, I just wanted to know.
You say you were about a hundred yards from the scene of the fight?
Just about, yeah.
Are you familiar with the land over there?
Yes, sir.
What's the nature of the layout?
Well, there's a little clearing...
Any trees? - A few.
Where are they?
They're between the clearing and the fairground.
And you saw right through the trees?
I was already through the trees when I saw them fightin'.
Oh, I see.
I suppose the clearing was all lit up by lights from the tar barrels.
No, sir.
How'd you see so well?
I told you, it was moon bright, Mr. Lincoln.
Moon bright?
Yes, sir.
Of course, if it hadn't been moon bright, you couldn't have seen a hundred yards, could you?
Course not.
But you did see it.
I told you I saw it, didn't I?
What's he driving at?
And, uh, the only reason you're tellin' us this now is 'cause you feel sorry for one of the defendants.
Well, I didn't want to see 'em both get hung.
Well, I don't reckon you'd lie about a thing like that.
You can step down.
No further questions, Your Honor.
Oh, Mr. Cass. I forgot. There's just one other question I want to ask you.
Cass, what'd you have against Scrub White?
Why, nothing.
What'd you kill him for then?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Look at this.
Go on, look at it.
It's the Farmer's Almanac.
Go ahead. Look at it. Look at page 12.
You see what it says about the moon?
That the moon was only in its first quarter that night and set at 10:21,
40 minutes before the killing took place.
So, you see, it couldn't have been moon bright, could it?
You lied, didn't you, Cass?
And you weren't trying to save these boys' necks, were you?
You were trying to save your own, weren't you?
Well, come on!
Weren't you? - No.
Well, then what'd you lie for?
I didn't lie.
Oh, yes, you did. It's as plain as the nose on your face. But why?
Why did you lie about the moonlight? - I don't know what you're talking about.
I'll tell you what I'm talking about.
You lied because you had a fight with Scrub White, but it wasn't about politics.
You never mentioned politics. That was your first lie, wasn't it?
It was politics, I tell you. It was!
No, you were fightin' about somethin' else. Maybe it was money.
Maybe you owed him money. - Or maybe he owed you some. - No.
No, that ain't right. - Well, what was it?
It was one of those things. Something made you want to get rid of Scrub.
You're crazy. Scrub was my friend.
Maybe. Just the same, you lied.
Now, why? Come on, tell us. Why'd you say you saw what happened when you didn't see?
I... - Well, I'll tell you what happened.
You heard a row, you saw the fight start and you come runnin', and you saw that Scrub was still livin'.
No. And right there on the ground, you saw the knife that Matt had dropped.
You bent over him and picked up the knife. - No. - Your body hid what you were doin'.
No. - And you stabbed him. - No, I didn't.
You stabbed him in the back and killed him! - No. And these two boys, Matt and Adam...
They each knew that he didn't do it, therefore, each thought the other did it.
And their mother...
she saw the knife in Matt's hand, but she couldn't say so without puttin' the rope around his neck.
And you... you killed him.
And you lied.
And your lie tripped you up.
That crude, cold-blooded lie that was gonna cover up the crime that you committed.
The lie you can't deny, now, can you? - No.
Can you? Answer me! You did kill him, didn't you?
Didn't you?
I... I didn't mean to kill him! I was drunk!
He was my friend! I didn't mean to kill him!
Honest! I didn't mean to kill him!
I was drunk!
No more questions, Your Honor.
Your witness.
Mr. Lincoln, I... I'm so glad you won.
Thank you, ma'am.
Mr. Lincoln, my congratulations.
Thank you, Mr. Douglas.
Yesterday I made some remarks about you that I now publicly retract.
Furthermore, I give you my sincere promise never to make the mistake of underrating you again.
Well, Steve, I don't reckon neither of us better underrate each other from here in.
Good day.
Hurry up, Abe!
The crowd's waiting!
Well, ma'am, I reckon I better say good-bye to you here.
You got quite a ways to go before sundown.
Good-bye, sir. - Good-bye, Mr. Lincoln.
Bye.
We ain't got very much, but after all you've done for us...
Thank you, ma'am.
That's mighty generous of you.
Watch out for the ruts, ma'am.
I reckon I'd just about die if I didn't kiss you, Mr. Lincoln.
Ain't you going back, Abe?
No, I think I might go on a piece, maybe to the top of that hill.
Help!
Help! Police!
Help!
Don't see no one taking that house yet awhile.
Nor me.
Blimey, it works.
Nancy, hurry. Hurry!
They're coming along now.
I saw the cab down the square. Go on. Give me the duster.
Good afternoon, Nancy.
Good afternoon, ma'am.
Good afternoon, sir.
Good afternoon.
What a beautiful voice he has, hasn't he?
Those are the Mallens from Number 12.
Yes. I thought we might call on them.
Not in London. It wouldn't be correct.
Oh, but...
My dear, I said no.
Only two maids.
I hear he's a foreigner.
But he looks most respectable.
Come on, Cobb.
All right behind?
Seen Mr Rough, John?
Over there, with Hannibal.
Excuse me, sir, the message from the vet about the mare. He says...
You all right, sir?
I've seen a ghost, Cobb.
What, here, sir?
The ghost of a man out of my past.
Oh, you mean when you were in the police force, sir.
Most of my ghosts are criminals, but this one wasn't.
I know the story of the house he lives in.
I was on a case there once, when I was a young peeler.
Louis Bauer!
The nephew of old Alice Barlow that was murdered 20 years ago.
Louis Bauer.
A foreigner he was, and very cut up, I remember.
Funny he should come back to 12 Pimlico Square after all these years.
12 Pimlico Square is Mr Mallen's house, sir.
Nonsense. Louis Bauer. Right face, right house.
No, you're wrong, sir.
Impossible.
What do you know about it, anyway?
It's the parlour maid, sir. You see, she's a friend of mine.
The family's name is Mallen.
And they live at Number 12?
Yes, sir.
Leastways, part of it.
Nancy says they don't use the top two storeys.
A bit queer, Nancy says.
It means less dusting for her, though.
Mrs Mallen's queer, too.
Queer, is she?
Mm...
In what way?
Well, she's sort of odd in her mind. She does strange things.
Nancy says Mr Mallen gets very upset. He goes out every night.
It's a very queer place.
Yes, it does sound queer.
I want you to see as much of her as you can.
What, the mare, sir?
No, no, your Nancy.
Oh, she's not mine. I'm only one of the pebbles on the beach.
Well, you play up to her. I want to know everything that goes on.
I believe I'm going to be very interested in Number 12.
A dirty evening for a stroll, sir.
There's a lot of dirty things in London.
Bella, what are you doing?
Nothing, Paul. Don't wake up.
What are you doing, Bella?
I thought I heard the muffin man.
Then why didn't you ring for Nancy to find out?
It would mean two journeys for her...
Ring for Nancy, Bella.
What do you suppose the servants are for?
To serve us, I suppose, dear.
Nancy, I rang. The muffin man.
Oh, I thought you rang for tea, ma'am. I was just bringing it up.
Then it's too late for muffins.
Not at all, my dear, not at all.
Nancy, spread the cloth, then lay the tea things, go down and get the muffins, cook the muffins, and bring up the muffins.
You see, my dear, it's all quite simple.
Light the gas, Nancy.
Yes, sir.
You're looking very impudent and pretty tonight, Nancy.
More broken hearts?
I don't know, I'm sure, sir.
Where do you get the colour for your cheeks, Nancy?
Could you not give the recipe to Mrs Mallen?
Oh no, sir. I'm natural.
Will that be all you're wanting, sir? - Yes, Nancy.
That'll do for the present.
Paul, as though I'd do anything to my face, or ask for her assistance if I did.
Oh, Bella, I was only trifling with her.
It's so humiliating for me.
That girl laughs at me enough, as it is.
Nonsense, Bella.
You know perfectly well how you imagine things.
Don't say that.
I have been better the last two weeks, haven't I?
What do you mean?
You know very well what I mean.
I've been trying so hard, and I have been better because you've been kind to me.
I'll be perfectly all right, if only you'll be patient and gentle with me.
Of course, my dear, of course.
Shall I stay in this evening?
Would you?
What shall we do?
Tea first.
And then I'll play for you.
We'll have an evening just like we used to.
Oh, Bella!
What is it?
I've just noticed something.
If you put it right while I'm not looking, I will say no more about it.
What's the matter?
I don't understand.
Paul, don't turn your back on me.
Look on the wall behind you.
The picture, it's gone again.
Yes. Where have you hidden it this time?
I didn't take it.
Why should I take it? It's no use to me.
Why should you take other things?
Pencils, knives...
Paul, don't.
Bella, where's the picture?
I didn't take it, I swear I didn't.
Come. Get the picture.
I'd know if I touched it. I'd remember.
I've been better lately.
You've missed nothing for days.
Two weeks, I've been well. I've had no headaches, no dreams.
Why should I take the...?
So you did know where it was.
I promise you, I didn't.
I supposed it was here because it was found here twice before.
Why do you persist in lying to me, Bella?
It's the truth.
Bella, if you're not lying, there's only one alternative.
You're losing your wits!
You promised you'd never say that to me again.
No control even of your hands.
You'd better go to your room.
No, no, not my room.
I can't bear to be alone.
Oh, God, help me.
God help you, indeed.
I'm going to appeal to you, Paul.
Please...
Please don't be angry with me.
I've never lied knowingly to you.
If I took the picture, or your ring, or your pencil, I...
I didn't know.
You must bear with me, Paul.
I don't know how much longer I can keep my patience.
Eavesdropping, Nancy?
No, sir.
I didn't hear anything. I was just carrying the muffins...
Your mistress is a very unusual woman.
Quite strange, you know.
You mustn't let things you hear and see in this house upset you.
You are a young girl. Inexperienced.
You are inexperienced, aren't you?
It depends how you mean, sir.
Thank you, Nancy.
Tillie, don't. You know he doesn't like it.
Isn't it a lovely day, Paul?
Look at the sunshine out in the square.
Where's my letter?
What letter?
I haven't had one for such a long time. I do hope it's from Cousin Vincent.
It isn't here.
Why should there be a letter for you?
Nancy told me there was one.
Oh, Bella.
Oh, she did. She did, Paul.
You've been through them yourself, dear. You see they're all addressed to me.
I had so hoped...
There must be a letter, Paul.
Nine o'clock.
Good morning, ma'am. Good morning, sir.
Good morning.
Good morning, Elizabeth.
The dog, Bella.
I'm sorry, Tillie. It won't be for long.
I will read from the 127th Psalm.
Except the Lord build the house..."
...but they speak with their enemies in the gate."
Let us pray.
Pimlico Square, I was after.
Number 14 is the only empty house in the square, I'm afraid.
We are the sole agents.
My pipe worrying you?
Not at all.
Faces south. A little alley runs along the back.
Nothing to block out the light.
But we'll have some difficulty, I'm afraid, Mr Rough.
Why's that?
The remainder of the lease of No.14 is in the hands of Mr Mallen of No.12.
And he's already refused three good offers.
Mr Mallen of Number 12?
Why won't he let?
Do you know, I have often wondered.
A queer profession, mine, Mr Rough.
So near to so many people's lives, and yet...
always on the doorstep, as it were.
Yes. Yes, indeed.
A fascinating study, human nature, Mr Rough.
Fascinating.
You don't think there's much chance of that house being on the market?
If you want to make an offer, do so, by all means.
I sometimes wonder if it's the noise he's afraid of.
The wife's a delicate woman. Just had a breakdown, I understand.
A charming creature.
I've seen her often walking in the gardens of the square with her dog.
Gardens?
Sounds very pleasant.
They're charming, they are.
I'm sorry.
Oh...
I wonder how that happened, eh?
Oh...
Oh, dear!
Oh, my dear lady!
I'm all right, thank you.
Where's my little dog?
Little savages.
I hope you're not hurt, ma'am?
No, not a bit.
You come and sit down over here.
Oh... No, I'm all right.
Oh, you can't possibly tell if you're hurt until you've had time to think it over.
It doesn't matter much when you've soft bones like those little rascals.
I should complain to their nurses.
It wasn't their fault. It was...
Oh, thank you.
That is kind of you. - Fond of children, I see.
Got any of your own?
No.
I must go.
You haven't counted all your bones yet.
Don't worry about me. I'm old enough to be your father.
They're not what they used to be.
Who aren't?
Children.
I'd be ashamed if I couldn't bowl a better hoop than that.
I never bothered about hoops. I was brought up in the country.
So was I. Whereabouts?
Devonshire.
Devonshire?
What part?
I lived with some cousins near Exmouth.
I know Exmouth very well.
I wonder if I've met them.
Their name was Ullswater.
Don't go yet. I was just getting interested.
Stop it! Stop it, you rude little boys!
It's disgraceful!
How dare they!
Hmm...
Poor little devils. I'd like to give them a taste of Devonshire.
Yes, a grass bank to roll down and some nice, clean mud.
Well, thank you for being so kind.
Toy shop! - I beg your pardon?
Something for those little objects to play with.
There is a toy shop across the road.
Oh, what a lovely idea. They do look so miserable.
Well, you'll have to come along, too. I mean, that's the whole idea.
Must have a woman about where brats are concerned, you know?
I mean, they'd run a mile if I were to so much as call to them.
I'd love to see them enjoy themselves...
What's to stop you?
My husband is out and he won't be back till teatime.
Then you'll be in time to have it with him.
I don't want to be silly, but I don't know you.
Oh, this is charity, ma'am. That blows convention out of the window.
Hey!
I mean you children out there in the street.
Come along. Don't be afraid.
I've got something for you.
Would you like some toys to play with?
It is such a shame you can't go into the square.
This gentleman thought...
There's a toy shop over there.
Tops, if you like, or hoops.
Do let's go across, shall we?
Good afternoon.
We've come to the wrong shop.
Buns and ice cream are what they want.
Do you think we should?
Nonsense! Make them all sick.
Do them a world of good.
You know what you want, don't you?
Come on in.
Here we are. Help yourselves.
Blimey, look at them lovely tarts!
There's plenty more.
Anything you like, in reason. That's right.
And what exactly can we do for you?
Knock his block off.
You, who cannot control yourself in your own home, to risk such a thing with a complete stranger!
It was the children, Paul.
A horde of noisy street urchins.
When you know the only hope for you is rest and quiet.
Put the dog down. You're not listening to me.
I am listening. What are you going to do?
I've told you before. I can't stand the dog in the drawing room.
I'm very fond of her, Paul.
It's not natural, the fuss you make over it.
Sometimes I wonder if you even want to be like other people.
Why did you ever marry me, Paul?
When I married you, Bella, you were a normal woman.
Or so I thought.
It's only since we came to this house that I've changed.
I never wanted to come here.
Yet it was my money that made it possible for you to buy it.
Is that why you married me, Paul?
You have changed, Bella.
What's made me change?
What's made you change, Paul?
Because you have, in the way you treat me.
I believe it's ever since that day when...
I found that old envelope addressed to Louis Bauer.
That was the first time that you were angry with me like this.
Bella, I told you I had forgotten that incident.
My only anxiety has always been to get you well.
I must get away from here.
I'll never be well till I get away from this house.
Come outside, Judy. Come along.
Hello, Judy. How do you do?
Guess what?
Paul, I could.
My cousins, the Ullswaters.
It would be lovely to smell Devonshire again.
Your cousin, Mr Vincent Ullswater, had the effrontery to oppose our marriage.
Oh, but that's over and done with. Vincent won't mind now.
But I mind. I have no desire to reopen our acquaintance.
Besides, I don't care to drag strangers into our troubles.
They're not strangers, they're my own people. They're all I have.
I want to see them, I...
I will see them.
If you see anyone, it will be a doctor.
No. No, not a doctor, Paul, I...
I'm well. I'm better.
Please leave me alone, Paul.
Whatever should I do?
Be quiet.
Oh, my poor head!
That was very cruel.
But I don't see how I can take the responsibility for you any longer.
Oh, Bella.
Don't cry.
You'll spoil your looks, and I wanted you to look very beautiful tonight.
Have you any objections to being seen out with your husband?
Why?
Are you going to take me out?
There's a charity concert tonight at Winterbourne House.
I could get tickets. I know Lady Winterbourne.
A concert, and you'd take me?
I should enjoy it, my dear...
Oh, how wonderful!
...provided that you promise to control yourself, to behave as you know I'd wish my wife to behave.
I promise. What shall I wear?
Whatever you look prettiest in, my dear.
Bella, wear the cameo brooch I gave you when we got engaged.
I will.
My brooch, please, Nancy.
The big cameo.
Yes, ma'am.
It's not here, ma'am. - It must be.
Look underneath.
Of course it's here. Let me look.
Perhaps I left it in another dress.
Bella!
Time to start, Bella.
Coming, Paul.
Nancy, my cloak.
Which one, ma'am?
Which one do you think?
Couldn't say, I'm sure, ma'am.
This will do.
What a very lovely person!
Charming. But not my brooch?
You know how fond I am of it... only it didn't go with this dress.
I wouldn't presume to criticise your taste.
But your hair, is it quite right?
Come, I'll hold that.
It's a quarter to eight, Bella.
I think I'm making it worse. My hand's quite shaky with excitement.
Ah, there's the cab.
I think I'm going to enjoy myself tonight.
Mr John and Mr Hogan.
How do you do?
Mr and Mrs Blair.
Prince Hanawa and Mr Ryan.
Mr and Mrs Mallen.
How do you do?
How do you do?
May I introduce my wife?
How do you do?
How do you do?
A very good cause, isn't it?
Lady Frinton, Miss Frinton.
Splendid cause, don't you think?
Mr Rollings, Miss Rollings.
Charming. Quite a complexion.
You are the most beautiful of all.
I hope the stool is right.
Thank you.
Bella...
Bella, my watch.
My watch is gone.
You must have forgotten it.
Don't worry about it now.
I don't know anything about it, Paul.
But it was in my pocket when we left the house.
Paul, don't look at me like that.
Let me have a look at your bag.
I didn't put it there. I swear I didn't.
Will you be quiet, please?
Control yourself, Bella.
Please spare me a scene in public.
Paul... a scene, no...
Shh.
Come.
Lady Winterbourne, I do apologise.
My wife had an attack.
Let me send for a doctor.
No, thank you. It's nothing unusual, unfortunately.
Come along, darling. Come along.
Paul, speak to me.
Don't sit there silent. I can't stand it.
Hit me, hurt me, do anything, but for pity's sake, speak to me.
Oh, dear.
Thank you, sir.
Good night, sir.
Good night.
Paul, how can you torture me like this?
And have you not tortured me?
You make my life a misery at home, and now you shame me in public.
At least let's keep your stealing, pickpocketing and lying to ourselves.
I haven't lied to you. I didn't take your watch.
What about the brooch?
Brooch?
The one I asked you to wear tonight. The one that didn't go with your dress.
It's upstairs in my room.
More lies.
It is. It must be. It's only mislaid, Paul.
You've hidden it away in one of your mad dreams.
I have not. If it's gone, someone else has taken it.
Someone else?
We'll see about someone else.
Elizabeth, Nancy, come up to the drawing room at once, please!
Paul, please don't question the servants in front of me.
Oh, dear, dear. What's happened now?
Mistress been playing him up again, I suppose.
There you are, Tillie. Go into your basket. There you are.
Stop titivating yourself. Come on.
Right.
Paul, please don't have that girl up here.
At least let me look again first.
Don't you giggle so much. Behave yourself.
It may have fallen behind the dressing table.
Let's talk this over between ourselves.
Please!
Please don't let the servants know.
Come in!
Shut the door, please, Elizabeth. Come into the room.
You know the cameo brooch your mistress often wears?
Yes, sir.
And you, Nancy?
Yes, sir.
It is missing.
Do you know anything about it?
I want you to think carefully before you answer, Elizabeth.
No, sir, I don't.
You will please kiss the Bible in token of your truthfulness.
Thank you.
And you, Nancy, have you ever touched the brooch?
No, sir, of course I haven't.
Thank you. You may go.
Be careful what you do. Don't commit sacrilege as well.
This is no sacrilege.
I swear by Almighty God that I neither took your watch, nor hid away the brooch.
Then you are mad, you unhappy creature.
And you'll get worse until you die, raving in an asylum!
And where the devil are you going, Nancy?
I came to see if there were any letters for the post, sir.
Are you expecting to meet somebody on your way to the post?
Only a gentleman friend, sir.
So I supposed.
Well, are there any letters, sir?
Come in here for a moment, will you?
Let me have a look at your hair.
Very good, sir.
Is there anything more you want, sir?
Perhaps.
Come closer, will you?
Yes, sir.
Is there anything you want, sir?
There. Can she do that for you?
I believe you're jealous of your mistress, Nancy.
Her?
She's a poor thing.
It's better than one of us to get excited.
Yes, Nancy, I believe it is.
You're mine now, aren't you?
'Cause you want me.
And do you want me?
I've always wanted you.
When shall we meet?
I'll let you know.
Not tonight?
No, I have to go out again.
Go along now. There's a good girl.
Very well.
You shall be master for a bit longer.
Good night, your lordship.
Is that you, Cobb?
Yes, sir.
All quiet?
The constable passed about 10 minutes ago, sir.
I reckon they can't get back from that concert before 11:00.
That will give me time to find out what he gets up to in Number 14.
The only thing is, sir,
I usually meet Nancy when she comes out at nine o'clock to post the letters.
She never came.
We'll have to risk it.
You wait about.
If Nancy does come out, squeeze her dry... of information, I mean.
Good evening, Nancy. You're late.
Hello, nice of you to wait.
Such goings-on.
Master made us swear things, kissing the Bible and all.
The master?
But I thought they were at the concert.
Oh, they came back early. Must've had another row.
Come along, I've got to take the letters.
Well, look, let me take them for you. It will save you the trouble.
No, I like a bit of air and a change.
Upstairs. There's someone moving. Elizabeth!
Oh, dear, is there no one?
It's all right, ma'am. I'm coming.
Elizabeth, there is someone upstairs. Someone moving.
There, there, ma'am. Don't take on so.
There isn't anybody in the house. Only you and me.
You mustn't let yourself imagine things.
Come into your room and drink your milk.
But I don't imagine things, Elizabeth. It's true. You can hear it.
Listen.
A moment ago, the wires on the gas dimmed as it does when someone turns on another light in the house.
Did you turn on another light, Elizabeth?
No, ma'am.
There's no one in the house but us. Nancy's out, and the master.
But it did a minute ago.
There, there, ma'am.
There's only something wrong with the pipes.
You must have dropped off and been dreaming you heard something.
That's right, Elizabeth. Dreaming.
If I dream things when I'm awake...
I'm going out of my mind, Elizabeth.
Oh, ma'am, you mustn't say such things.
You know, Elizabeth.
Well, the master did say something, but...
I once knew a girl who died in a lunatic asylum.
I remember her eyes.
That was how they first knew.
If there's anything I can do, ma'am?
No, thank you, Elizabeth.
There isn't anything anybody can do.
Yes, Cobb?
There's a letter from Australia, sir.
Australia?
Give it to me.
Cobb, I really am a remarkable man.
Yes, sir?
It's my memory. Amazing.
They shall have it for the museum when I die.
With any luck, this should help us.
When is Nancy's next night out?
Well, tonight, sir.
Yes. I wish it was Mrs Mallen's instead.
Still, it all goes to show that I'm on the right lines, as usual.
All I want now is evidence.
Evidence of what, sir?
Well, I'm certain that he is Louis Bauer, and I've a shrewd idea of what he's up to in that house.
Can't prove it, of course.
The only one who can help us is that poor woman.
And she's crazy.
She will be if she stays there much longer.
Does she know that he's not Mallen?
I don't think so.
But she knows something. That's her danger.
That's why we've got to get her away from him, out of that house.
That's easier said than done, sir.
What is it?
A gentleman to see the governor.
It's a stranger, sir. Shall I take...?
Thank God you're here, sir!
I didn't know he was a friend of yours.
Never seen him in my life before.
Are you Mr Rough?
That's right.
I got your letter. I'm...
Mr Vincent Ullswater from Devonshire.
Come along and sit down, sir. I've got a lot to talk to you about.
Your boots, sir.
Mm-hmm.
Mrs Mallen is in her room?
Yes, sir.
I think she's got a headache, sir.
Did you ever know a time when Mrs Mallen did no! have a headache?
Hardly ever, sir.
And when is your next evening out, Nancy?
Tonight, sir.
And where do you usually pass the evenings with your gentlemen friends?
Walking around the square, sir. Or in the park.
Then perhaps it would be departing too much from tradition if you were to come with me to a music hall.
Ooh!
Do you mean it?
I always mean what I say.
I shall meet you at 7:50 at the corner of the square.
You're a rum 'un. I thought you was never going to do nothing.
That will do, Nancy. Answer the bell.
Is Mrs Mallen at home?
What name should I say, sir?
Her cousin, Mr Ullswater.
Very good, sir.
How do you do?
How do you do?
Will you come in here for a moment?
See that Mrs Mallen is not informed of this call.
Very good, sir.
I hope you'll forgive me for calling at this hour, but I happened to be in London, and I'd hoped to see Bella.
I'm sorry, but my wife is unable to see you.
Mr Mallen, this is a little difficult to explain, but you may remember that at the time of your marriage, there was a slight friction between us.
I was peculiarly alive to the fact.
My sister and I have long regretted these differences.
They've kept us separated from Bella too long.
In your opinion.
We're anxious to see her again, have her stay with us in Devonshire.
The air always used to do her so much good down there.
You're under the impression she's ill?
Well...
And what has given you that impression?
She was never strong.
I'm the best guardian of my wife's health.
All the same, I should like to see my cousin.
Bella was with me when we heard you arrive.
If she had wished to see you, she wouldn't have asked me to speak to you down here.
She refused to see me?
The inference appears to me perfectly clear.
I don't think I like your tone, Mallen.
You're under no obligation to listen to it, Mr Ullswater.
I'm not going to leave this house until I see my cousin.
Do you propose to interfere between a husband and wife?
It would require physical force, Mr Ullswater.
Nancy, will you please show this gentleman out?
Yes, sir.
Vincent!
Paul!
I've just seen Vincent out in the square.
Has he been here?
Yes, he's been here.
And you let him go without seeing me.
Paul, why didn't you tell me?
So you did write to him?
Write?
Against my express orders, you went behind my back and complained to your cousins.
But I didn't. I've never written to them.
How did he know this address?
I don't know.
Or that you'd been ill?
I don't know.
What else did you tell him?
Nothing. I never wrote.
What lies about me have you told him?
Paul, if I had written, which I didn't, do you suppose I'd have said a word to my cousins against my husband?
Do you think I can trust the insane ravings of a madwoman?
Paul, don't say that.
Your mind is diseased!
You are as witless as an animal!
Paul.
I'm desperate.
If I do the things you say, then I am going mad.
It's when you're angry with me like this...
My head aches, and my mind gets tired.
You must help me, Paul.
If you were afflicted, I would be gentle.
I should love you more.
Let go of my arm.
Paul, how can you be so cruel?
You used not to be.
It's only since we came to this hateful, horrible house that everything's changed.
It must be because of that envelope I found.
Who was Louis Bauer?
There's no such person as Louis Bauer.
Then why should that have changed our lives, just a name on an old envelope?
There was never even an envelope!
That was the beginning of your madness, when I realised you were a half-witted creature who pried through my desk and my papers.
But this is the end.
You're not only mad, you are dangerous!
You are going to see a doctor, madam.
No, Paul, not a doctor.
More than one doctor tomorrow morning.
I'm too tired.
Paul, did you ever love me?
I hate you.
You are utterly repulsive to me.
Louis Bauer.
What I can't understand is my cousin not wanting to see me.
You've only got his word for it.
She's his wife. I couldn't force him to let me see her.
Surely there must be something we can do to help her.
Nothing you can do now.
It won't do to let him get really afraid of your interference.
My cab will take you back to your hotel.
It's very kind of you.
I hate leaving you to deal with this. After all, I am her cousin.
Well, I can perhaps use methods that you can't.
I may need your influence to get a warrant, if I can't get my evidence.
Good.
But he won't risk anything that'll lead to an inquiry afterwards.
In the meantime, you know where to find me.
Anderson's Hotel.
Jim, Anderson's Hotel.
Right. Come on.
Mr Rough. Mr Rough, sir.
What's the trouble?
It's Mrs Mallen.
What's happened?
He's going to have her certified.
How do you know?
Well, Nancy heard...
Come to the point, boy.
Well, I waited, and I saw Nancy and Mr Mallen get into a cab.
Where have they gone?
To Canterbury Music Hall.
This is our chance.
Where are we going?
Save your breath. You'll need it later on.
Enjoying yourself?
I'll say so. Aren't you?
Immensely.
Life's gonna be one long holiday for you after tomorrow.
Bachelor, eh?
Brooch. No, that's not it.
Oh, Elizabeth, it's you. Help me to move this.
My brooch may have dropped behind.
If only I could find my brooch, he may not send for the doctors.
A gentleman to see you, ma'am.
Tell him my husband isn't in.
It's you he wants to see, ma'am, not the master.
And he says it's urgent.
Vincent. He's come back. I'm sorry, Elizabeth.
Good evening, Mrs Mallen.
You? But I thought...
Last time we met, your husband interrupted us, but he won't this time.
I don't understand.
You will indeed, ma'am, very shortly.
You just sit down. Make yourself comfortable.
You're supposed to be going off your head, aren't you?
Who told you?
Why do you say that?
Ladies and gentlemen, the cancan dancers.
Direct from Paris, and I know you're gonna like them.
Of course, as I know more about what they're going to do than you do at the present,
I hope you'll excuse my back.
Vulgar.
The whole of this house was ransacked.
The murderer had searched for those rubies all through the night.
And the opinion of the police was that he'd found them and vanished with them.
And they never caught him?
No.
But suppose he didn't find those rubies after all.
Suppose they were concealed in the walls or the floor of old Alice Barlow's bedroom, which was the room above yours, Mrs Mallen.
The footsteps.
What footsteps?
And the gaslight going up and down.
Here, what's the matter?
Come along.
But there's another tune just starting.
I've had enough. Come along now, please.
That's what's made me sure my mind is going.
Lying in my room watching the gaslight, listening for someone in a place where no one can go.
Yes, they can. Along the roof from the empty house next door.
But what are you saying?
It fits. It all fits.
Tell me, have you ever heard the name Louis Bauer?
It's a trap!
I never said I found that envelope.
No, no.
It's a lie. Go away. Leave this house.
Come, come. Good girl.
What do you know about Louis Bauer?
I found...
I thought I found an envelope addressed to him.
It was when we first came here.
That's what started my...
I've got it. I've solved it. I've saved you!
God, what a marvellous man I am!
What are you talking about?
Your Mr Mallen is my Mr Louis Bauer.
A criminal maniac who murdered his aunt and steals back to his own house at night, still searching for those rubies he couldn't find 20 years ago.
And every time he lights the gas up in that room, so it dims down here.
And when the light brightens, I...
I hear his key in the door a few minutes afterwards.
I can't stand it. My mind...
No, you are not going out of your mind, Mrs Mallen.
You're slowly and methodically being driven out of your mind.
Why?
Because, quite by accident, you got onto his identity, and that made you dangerous to him.
He couldn't get rid of you by ordinary means, for fear of an inquiry.
So he's driving you mad, in order to discredit anything that you say as the ravings of a lunatic.
Thank God you're not married to him.
Not married to him?
Certainly not.
He married another lady long before he met you, and she's still alive.
How do you know?
I've been finding out things about Mr Louis Bauer.
Where is this woman?
That's the trouble. Australia.
That's three months away. By then it would be too late to save you.
That's why you've got to give me the evidence we need.
What evidence?
Any proof of Louis Bauer's identity.
But I don't know where to find it.
Tell me where to look.
Yes, but...
In here?
You don't understand.
To me, he's still my husband.
I couldn't betray my husband.
You mean the man who betrayed you into thinking you were married to him?
That's different. That was before I knew him.
We've lived together as husband and wife.
If I betrayed him, I'd be betraying myself.
Even though I tell you at this moment he's sitting in a music hall with another woman?
Your parlour maid.
Is that true?
You go straight in, and I'll follow you in a moment.
What you gonna do?
Take a little stroll.
Will we go out again?
I'll let you know.
I know you will.
He keeps his papers in there.
Then this is where we start.
But it's locked.
Good!
That means there are probably some things inside that are very interesting.
Do you mind if I take me coat off?
I always work much better with me coat off.
Saucy shirt, isn't it?
What are you going to do?
There's only two things I've ever wanted to be.
A gardener or a burglar. Both of them nice, quiet occupations.
This is tougher than I thought.
You mustn't force it.
Afraid I'll have to.
But what shall I say when he comes back?
Don't you realise it's tonight or never?
Tomorrow he wants to get you certified.
If we go back, we're lost. We must gamble on finding something.
Now, are you with me? - All right.
Force it, but be quick.
There's no hurry, ma'am. He's quite happy where he is.
I don't like these violent methods. Makes me feel like a dentist.
All over now.
Drawn a blank so far.
Give me the keys.
I suppose he keeps his papers in here.
Huh!
Look! He's back. He's upstairs.
Oh, I'm afraid.
How long does he usually stay?
Any time. An hour, 10 minutes.
We shall want longer than that.
There.
That's done for, I'm afraid, but we shall have to risk it. Come along.
Come along.
I can't see him.
I daren't. - You shan't.
Go right up to your room, lock yourself in, and don't come out, in any circumstances, until I tell you.
You're not going. You won't leave the house?
Of course not.
But Elizabeth?
Don't you worry about Elizabeth. I've squared her.
And remember, you're all right so long as you stay in your room.
Bella?
I brought you milk.
Go upstairs and tell Mrs Mallen she's to come down here at once.
Just like that, sir?
Very good, sir.
Are you there, ma'am?
Master says you're to come to the drawing room at once.
She won't answer. She's got the door locked. I tried it.
All right, Nancy. Go to bed.
I've got to let the dog out first.
You needn't worry about the dog. Go to bed.
What's the game? What are you up to, eh?
Will you kindly remember that you're not a guest in this house?
All right, all right.
Bella, I have your dog here.
I found it in the drawing room where you know it is not allowed.
Dog?
Paul, no!
No! Don't hurt it, I'm coming!
I'm coming.
Give me the dog.
What have you done with it?
Dog? What dog?
You said you had it. Have you hurt it?
I haven't seen your dog.
Another of your dreams.
Like the one in which you dared break open my desk!
Dream?
Don't tell me it was a dream, that he never came here.
He?
Who came?
Tell me about this dream of yours.
I dreamed that a man came in here.
A dream.
I know you dreamed.
But tell me about the man.
Speak, will you?
I want to know more about the man!
I dreamed and I...
A dream!
Was I a part of this curious dream?
Who are you?
Apparently a mere figment of this lady's imagination.
How did you get in?
We ghosts don't have to bother about doors.
If you don't tell me your business...
I came to call upon another ghost.
The ghost of the man who murdered Alice Barlow in this very room.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Haven't you, Mr Louis Bauer?
My name is Mallen.
No, it isn't.
You've been listening to my wife's insane ramblings?
Correct. Except that she isn't insane, nor is she your wife.
You dare to break into my house. You tamper with my desk!
Where you and I know lies the evidence that you are Louis Bauer.
Here's what you want.
It will give me great pleasure to see you make a fool of yourself before I throw you out of the house!
Hmm.
Seems to be nothing here.
My brooch.
Then it's true. You did hide my things.
You laid traps for me and said that I lied to you.
I found the brooch only today and put it aside until I could give it back to you.
Give it to me.
This isn't your brooch.
I gave it to my wife as an engagement present.
Where did you get it from?
It's second-hand.
How do you know?
There's an inscription in it.
Where? Where?
Inside. It's a trick. I discovered it by accident.
Show me.
To A.B."
What are these?
There were some sort of stones in it.
Stones?
Where are they? Quick.
They were loose, so I took them out and put them in here.
There you are!
Alice Barlow's brooch, Alice Barlow's rubies.
Â£20,000 worth.
This brooch and these rubies are going to send you to the gallows.
Give them to me.
Get out of the room quickly.
Look!
Help! Oh, quick, hurry!
That will hold him. We shan't need any more.
Did you get my message through to Mr Ullswater?
Yes, sir.
You go for the police now, and hurry.
Very good, sir.
It's all over now, ma'am. You can go along up to your room.
I'll deal with the servants.
I want to speak to my wife. Alone.
You go up to your room.
I, too, want to speak to my husband.
No, you'll only be torturing yourself.
I want to speak to him alone.
Very well, if you insist.
I don't suppose... I'll hear you if you call.
Bella. Quick, Bella, the rubies.
Help me to get away, and give me them.
Rubies?
How you lusted for them.
Look at them.
Look.
Bella, hurry.
Get the knife there in the drawer. Cut me free and give them to me.
Quick, Bella. Cut the rope here.
Take the knife.
Knife?
What knife?
Are you suggesting this is a knife I have in my hand?
Have you gone mad, my sane husband?
There was a knife, but I lost it.
I always hide things away, because I'm mad.
Bella, what are you saying?
Rubies.
You killed a woman for them.
And me, you tried to kill my mind.
You made me mad. "Witless as an animal," you said.
Now you're helpless, and I'm mad.
Bella!
No!
Better let him hold them.
The rubies.
How do you do?
My name is Deems Taylor, and it's my very pleasant duty to welcome you here on behalf of Walt Disney, Leopold Stokowski and all the other artists and musicians whose combined talents went into the creation of this new form of entertainment, Fantasia.
What you're going to see are the designs and pictures and stories that music inspired in the minds and imaginations of a group of artists.
In other words, these are not going to be the interpretations of trained musicians.
Which I think is all to the good.
Now, there are three kinds of music on this Fantasia program.
First is the kind that tells a definite story.
Then there's the kind that, while it has no specific plot, does paint a series of, more or less, definite pictures.
Then there's a third kind, music that exists simply for its own sake.
Now, the number that opens our Fantasia program, the Toccata and Fugue, is music of this third kind, what we call absolute music.
Even the title has no meaning beyond a description of the form of the music.
What you will see on the screen is a picture of the various abstract images that might pass through your mind if you sat in a concert hall listening to this music.
At first you're more or less conscious of the orchestra.
So our picture opens with a series of impressions of the conductor and the players.
Then the music begins to suggest other things to your imagination.
They might be, oh, just masses of color.
Or they may be cloud forms or great landscapes or vague shadows or geometrical objects floating in space.
So now we present the Toccata and Fugue in D Minor by Johann Sebastian Bach, interpreted in pictures by Walt Disney and his associates, and in music by the Philadelphia Orchestra and its conductor, Leopold Stokowski.
You know, it's funny how wrong an artist can be about his own work.
Now, the one composition of Tchaikovsky's that he really detested was his Nutcracker Suite, which is probably the most popular thing he ever wrote.
It's a series of dances taken out of a full-length ballet called The Nutcracker that he once composed for the St. Petersburg opera house.
It wasn't much of a success and nobody performs it nowadays, but I'm pretty sure you'll recognize the music of the Suite when you hear it.
Incidentally, you won't see any nutcracker on the screen.
There's nothing left of him but the title.
And now we're going to hear a piece of music that tells a very definite story.
As a matter of fact, in this case, the story came first and the composer wrote the music to go with it.
It's a very old story, one that goes back almost 2,000 years.
A legend about a sorcerer who had an apprentice.
He was a bright young lad, very anxious to learn the business.
As a matter of fact, he was a little bit too bright because he started practicing some of the boss's best magic tricks before learning how to control them.
One day, for instance, when he'd been told by his master to carry water to fill a cauldron, he had the brilliant idea of bringing a broomstick to life to carry the water for him.
Well, this worked very well, at first.
Unfortunately, however, having forgotten the magic formula that would make the broomstick stop carrying the water, he found he'd started something he couldn't finish.
Mr. Stokowski.
Mr. Stokowski.
My congratulations, sir.
Congratulations to you, Mickey.
Gee, thanks.
Well, so long.
I'll be seein' ya.
Goodbye.
When Igor Stravinsky wrote his ballet, The Rite of Spring...
I repeat, when Igor Stravinsky wrote his ballet, The Rite of Spring, his purpose was, in his own words, to "express primitive life."
And so Walt Disney and his fellow artists have taken him at his word.
Instead of presenting the ballet in its original form, as a simple series of tribal dances, they have visualized it as a pageant, as the story of the growth of life on Earth.
And that story, as you're going to see it, isn't the product of anybody's imagination.
It's a coldly accurate reproduction ofwhat science thinks went on during the first few billion years of this planet's existence.
Science, not art, wrote the scenario of this picture.
According to science, the first living things here were single-celled organisms, tiny little white or green blobs of nothing in particular that lived under the water.
And then, as the ages passed, the oceans began to swarm with all kinds of marine creatures.
Finally, after about a billion years, certain fish, more ambitious than the rest, crawled up on land and became the first amphibians.
And then, several hundred million years ago, nature went off on another tack and produced the dinosaurs.
Now, the name "dinosaur" comes from two Greek words meaning "terrible lizard."
And they certainly were all of that.
They came in all shapes and sizes, from little, crawling horrors about the size of a chicken to hundred-ton nightmares.
They were not very bright.
Even the biggest of them had only the brain of a pigeon.
They lived in the air and water as well as on land.
As a rule, they were vegetarians, rather amiable and easy to get along with.
However, there were bullies and gangsters among them.
The worst of the lot, a brute named tyrannosaurus rex, was probably the meanest killer that ever roamed the Earth.
The dinosaurs were lords of creation for about 200 million years.
And then... Well, we don't exactly know what happened.
Some scientists think that great droughts and earthquakes turned the whole world into a gigantic dustbowl.
In any case, the dinosaurs were wiped out.
That is where our story ends.
Where it begins is at a time infinitely far back, when there was no life at all on Earth.
Nothing but clouds of steam, boiling seas and exploding volcanoes.
So now, imagine yourselves out in space billions and billions of years ago, looking down on this lonely, tormented little planet, spinning through an empty sea of nothingness.
And now we'll have a 15-minute intermission.
Before we get into the second half of the program,
I'd like to introduce somebody to you, somebody who's very important to Fantasia.
He's very shy and very retiring.
I just happened to run across him one day at the Disney studios.
But when I did, I suddenly realized that here was not only an indispensable member of the organization, but a screen personality whose possibilities nobody around the place had ever noticed.
And so I'm very happy to have this opportunity to introduce to you the soundtrack.
All right. Come on. That's all right.
Atta soundtrack.
Now, watching him, I discovered that every beautiful sound also creates an equally beautiful picture.
Now, look.
Will the soundtrack kindly produce a sound?
Go on, don't be nervous. Go ahead. Any sound.
Well, that isn't quite what I had in mind.
Suppose we hear and see the harp.
Now one of the strings, say, the violin.
And now... now, one of the woodwinds, a flute.
Very pretty.
Now, let's have a brass instrument, the trumpet.
All right.
Now, how about a low instrument, the bassoon?
Go on. Go on.
Drop the other shoe, will you?
Well, now to finish, suppose we see some of the percussion instruments, beginning with the bass drum.
Thanks a lot, old man.
The symphony that Beethoven called the Pastoral, his sixth, is one of the few pieces of music he ever wrote that tells something like a definite story.
He was a great nature lover, and in this symphony, he paints a musical picture of a day in the country.
Now, of course, the country that Beethoven described was the countryside with which he was familiar.
But his music covers a much wider field than that, so Walt Disney has given the Pastoral Symphony a mythological setting.
And that setting is of Mt. Olympus, the abode of the gods.
And here, first of all, we meet a group of fabulous creatures of the field and forest, unicorns, fauns, Pegasus, the flying horse, and his entire family, the centaurs, those strange creatures that are half-man and half-horse.
And their girlfriends, the centaur-ettes.
Later on, we meet our old friend, Bacchus, the god ofwine, presiding over a bacchanal.
The party is interrupted by a storm.
And now, we see Vulcan forging thunderbolts and handing them over to the king of all the gods, Zeus, who plays darts with them.
As the storm clears, we see Iris, the goddess of the rainbow.
And Apollo, driving his sun chariot across the sky.
And then Morpheus, the god of sleep, covers everything with his cloak of night, as Diana, using the new moon as a bow, shoots an arrow of fire that spangles the sky with stars.
Now we're going to do one of the most famous and popular ballets ever written,
The Dance of the Hours from Ponchielli's opera La Gioconda.
It's a pageant of the hours of the day.
We see first a group of dancers in costumes to suggest the delicate light of dawn.
Then a second group enters dressed to represent the brilliant light of noon day.
As these withdraw, a third group enters in costumes that suggest the delicate tones of early evening.
Then a last group, all in black, the somber hours of the night.
Suddenly, the orchestra bursts into a brilliant finale in which the hours of darkness are overcome by the hours of light.
All this takes place in the great hall with its garden beyond, of the palace of Duke Alvise, a Venetian nobleman.
The last number on our Fantasia program is a combination of two pieces of music so utterly different in construction and mood that they set each other off perfectly.
The firstis A Night on Bald Mountain, by one of Russia's greatest composers, Modest Mussorgsky.
The second is Franz Schubert's world-famous Ave Maria.
Musically and dramatically, we have here a picture of the struggle between the profane and the sacred.
Bald Mountain, according to tradition, is the gathering place of Satan and his followers.
Here on Walpurgis Night, which is the equivalent of our own Halloween, the creatures of evil gather to worship their master.
Under his spell, they dance furiously until the coming of dawn and the sounds of church bells send the infernal army slinking back into their abodes of darkness.
And then we hear the Ave Maria, with its message of the triumph of hope and life over the powers of despair and death.
What's new?
Same old daily bunkeroo.
Mr. Powers says he wants to see that foreign stuff as soon as it comes in.
Don't declare war for a few minutes.
According to a high official, it is believed"...
Foreign correspondent.
I could get more news out of Europe looking in the crystal ball.
That Stebbins cable has a morsel in it.
Stebbins makes me sick. They all make me sick.
Europe about to blow up... and all I can get from my foreign staff is a daily guessing game.
I want some facts, Mr. Bradley. - For instance?
Any kind of fact.
There must be something going on in Europe... beside a nervous breakdown.
Why not try sending me over, Mr. Powers?
You've written a book on economics or something.
The Twilight of Feudalism? - Yes.
It was very well received. - Not by me.
I don't want any more economists, sages, or oracles bombinating over our cable.
I want a reporter.
Someone who doesn't know the difference between an ism and a kangaroo.
A good, honest crime reporter. That's what the Globe needs.
That's what Europe needs.
There's a crime hatching on that bedeviled continent.
Wait a minute.
I've got something that might pass for an idea.
Who was that fellow that ran down the payroll robbery last week?
You mean Johnny Jones.
He beat up a policeman, didn't he, in the line of duty? Yes.
There's some talk at the city desk of firing him.
Beat up a policeman?
Sounds ideal for Europe.
Send Mr. Jones up here right away.
Mr. Powers wants to see you, Mr. Jones.
He does?
You should come to his office right away.
What about?
I ain't in his confidence.
Tell him to save his breath. Tell him I've resigned.
I'm supposed to bring you there.
Okay.
Wait till I open this.
Where's Mr. Jones?
I told you to send him right up here!
Are you Mr. Jones? - Yes.
Sit down, please.
You mind a personal question?
No. - Are you married?
No luck.
Single?
Ever been in Europe?
No.
What's your opinion of the present European crisis, Mr. Jones?
What crisis?
I'm referring to the impending war, Mr. Jones. That.
To tell you the truth, I haven't given it much thought.
You don't keep up with our foreign news, do you?
Now, look Mr.Powers, If you gonna fire me, you can scrap the intelligence test. It's perfectly okay with me.
I can get a job on any newspaper in town within an hour.
So long. Wait a minute.
Nobody fired you.
How would you like to cover the biggest story in the world today?
With an expense account, I'll cover anything.
You'll get an expense account.
Okay, what's the story?
Europe.
I'm afraid I'm not exactly equipped, but I could do some reading up. No reading up.
I like you just as you are.
What Europe needs is a fresh, unused mind.
Foreign correspondent? - No.
Reporter.
I don't want correspondence.
I want news.
Can you dig up some news in Europe?
I'll be happy to try, sir.
This is what I mean:
Mr. Van Meer, when questioned by our oracle, Mr. Stebbins... refused to open his mouth.
A 1,200-word cable told... to the fact that the great Van Meer had nothing to say.
You Know what that kind of stuff is doing?
It's driving our readers crazy with frustration. - Who's Van Meer?
Keynote to the European situation today.
If Van Meer stays at the helm of his country's affairs... for the next three months, it may mean peace in Europe.
If we knew what he was thinking we'd know where Europe stands. - German?
No.
Holland's strongman.
One of the two signers of the Dutch treaty with Belgium.
Now, this is your first assignment.
I want you to talk with him... find out what's in that treaty, and what he thinks is going to happen.
Van Meer?
Right.
Anybody else?
How about Hitler?
Don't you think it's a good idea to pump him?
He must have something on his mind.
Mr.Stephen Fisher to see you, Mr.Powers
Tell him to come in.
Did you ever hear of Stephen Fisher?
I'm afraid he's not on my beat.
He is from now on.
He's head of the Universal Peace Party and very close to Van Meer.
They're both working to prevent Europe going up in flames.
How do you do, Mr. Fisher?
Nice of you to come over. - Sit down. - Thank you.
Mr. Fisher, Mr. Jones, our new foreign correspondent. I want you to know each other.
How do you do, Mr. Jones? Jones.
I don't like that name.
It's going to handicap you, young man.
Now, wait a minute.
I've got some sort of a name here.
Haverstock. Huntley Haverstock.
Sounds more important, doesn't it, Mr. Fisher?
Yes, very dashing.
Sounds better than Richard Harding Davis.
What's the matter with that?
We can't use that.
That's the name of one of our greatest war correspondents 40 years ago.
Speak up, young man. You don't mind being Huntley Haverstock, do you?
A rose by any name, sir.
It's exciting being present at the christening of a newspaper correspondent.
Shouldnt we break a bottle of champagne?
Break one over my head to see if I'm still awake.
Huntley Haverstock.
Mr. Haverstock, you better get started. You've got a lot to do.
Passports, photos, visas... - Expenses.
I'll send a note to the cashier.
I hope you brought your Sunday articles.
I managed three of them.
See you in London then, Mr. Haverstock.
Yes, of course.
Thank you, Mr. Powers. Thank you for everything.
Except Huntley Haverstock.
Get a load of this, Mother.
How's it look? Chic?
Don't wear it over one eye. It makes you look like a dandy.
You always think the boys are wearing their hats over one eye.
Let him wear it the way it is.
He'll have to wear a stovepipe in London.
They call them poppers over there.
Toppers.
Bobby, put that in the box for Uncle John, will you?
Let me try it on.
No, I want to try it on.
Now he's a regular war correspondent. - Without a war.
I'm afraid he'll get his war.
They're throwing a big bluff over there.
Let's hope so.
Mother, How do you like the way we've our little nest furnished?
If I were you, I'd hang lighter curtains, and move that sofa out here.
It's too bad you haven't an open fireplace.
If you'd speak to the captain, I think he'd attend to everything.
All ashore that's going ashore!
Now, Mother.
You're Jones?
My name is Stebbins, London man for the Globe.
Mr. Powers told me you'd probably be here. How nice of you to come. Reminds me.
I lost mine on the way over.
I can say your other name, too.
That Huntley...
I could say it yesterday... but I had a rather tough session with the boys last night.
So I'll stick to Jones if you don't mind.
Jones is great with me.
Let's get out of here.
This crowd's making me nervous. My nerves aren't in the pink.
Just take it easy. I'll follow you right along.
Porter, bring those bags. And don't bang them into my knees from behind.
What about a drink after that long train ride?
Sounds like a very logical idea.
I may not act it, but I've been here 25 years.
London man for the Globe and they haven't caught onto me yet.
How'd you manage it?
Cable back the government handouts and sign them...
Our London correspondent." - What's yours?
Scotch and soda, please.
Miss?
Miss, please.
Scotch and soda, and a glass of milk.
A glass of milk? I'm on the wagon.
I went to the doctor today about these jitters I got... and he said it was the wagon for a month or a whole new set of organs.
I can't afford a whole new set of organs.
If I'd known you're on the wagon, I could have got along without this.
But as long as it's here...
Good luck.
Good?
Yeah, just like any other Scotch and soda.
That's what I thought.
Doesnt taste the way it did when I was a baby.
That's got poison in it.
Speaking of poison, I've got some pills I got to take.
Here's some cables that have been coming over from New York.
They love to cable from Newyork.
It makes them think you're working for them.
There's an invitation to that lunch for the Dutchman Van Meer tomorrow. I guess that's your dish.
This is given by the Universal Peace Party.
That's Fisher's organization, right? I don't know.
I don't follow those things very much.
New York wants it, I send it.
That's the secret of being a correspondent.
Been doing it 25 years.
Twenty-five years, and I end up on milk.
Good morning. How's the water wagon?
Look at that.
One of them shook off this morning.
I'm just on my way to the Van Meer luncheon.
I'm lunching with old man Clark. He's the International Press... Here you are.
I didn't know whether to meet you in the grill or upstairs.
Goodbye, Stebbins. Goodbye, Miss Clark.
Who's he calling Clark?
He's got his nerve.
Some fresh American reporter.
Good morning, Mr. Van Meer.
I beg your pardon, sir. You are Mr. Van Meer, aren't you?
That's my name, yes. I'm Haverstock.
You don't know me. I'm an American.
And I just happen to be on my way to your luncheon.
Then, perhaps...
That's very kind of you, sir...
Come, come. It's all in a good cause.
Savoy Hotel.
This is very kind of you.
It's a pleasure, my boy.
I dislike riding alone.
One thinks too much while riding alone. The Polish situation, and the Dutch treaty with the Belgians... must be on your mind quite a lot these days. Yes, exactly.
What do you feel that England will do in case the Nazis...
England is so beautiful.
It's nice to see London in the sunshine.
Always there's lots of rain or fog. Also it is August.
I found out it was August. That's pretty good for me.
But, would you mind telling me... how you feel about Mr. Fisher and his Peace Organization?
You know Mr. Fisher?
A very fine man. And a good man.
I wish there were more like him in the world just now. Well...
I take it you don't think there's much hope for peace?
I mean, you don't think one little peace organization... can make much headway against the European war panic?
I would like to think so.
Look at those birds.
No matter how big the city, there must always be parks... and places for the birds to live.
I was walking through the park this morning... and I saw several people feeding the birds.
It's a good sign at a time like this. Is it not?
Yes, it's a dandy sign... but I do think that right now birds are the least of our problems. Your country, for instance.
What's its attitude toward these matters?
We're now near the Savoy.
How much?
A shilling.
By the way, young man, what newspaper do you represent?
As a matter of fact, I'm not exactly a reporter... but I was trying to get you to talk.
I didn't want bird talk either.
I gathered that.
Just what was it that you were trying to get me to tell you?
To be perfectly frank, I was trying to find out what you know about the possibility of a general war.
How do you really feel about it?
My boy, I feel very old and sad... and helpless.
I did have one.
The last news from Poland was very alarming.
Nobody wants a war...
Then we don't have to have it.
You must understand, often circumstances over which we've no control...
Yes, those convenient circumstances over which we have no control. It's always seems odd, but they usually bring on a war.
You never hear of circumstances over which we've no control... rushing us into peace, do you?
Very determined woman, my daughter. Come on.
Let's go and see if you can pick a fight somewhere else.
Good for you. - Wasnt he a bore?
So many worthy people are, my dear, bless them.
How do you like to be fishing in Ireland this minute?
What a place for going. We haven't had a good sail or swim together in months.
Not even a game of cribbage. Miss them?
There's the Admiral.
He has a weakness for you. Go on. Do your stuff.
The Jones that became a Haverstock. Have a good trip across?
Still wish you were Richard Harding Davis. - So do I, sir.
Anything except...
Hello.
Mrs. Appleby, meet Huntley Haverstock, Special Correspondent, New York Globe.
Foreign correspondent? Not really. - Cross my heart.
You look such a dear, sweet boy. You don't seem a bit like the others.
But I'm sure you're marvelous at it.
Do you know a friend of mine, Monte Rockingham? He's in the embassy at Istanbul.
Do help me with this distinguished-looking gentleman here. I can't make any headway with him, but I'm sure he speaks some language.
I haven't the least idea who he is... but there's nobody here who isn't internationally important.
This is Mr. Haver... - Stock.
No English?
Try German.
What else do you know?
Pig Latin.
Here we are.
This will do it.
Now we're getting somewhere. The universal language.
Well, they come in pairs.
If you speak English, give me a hand with the laughing Latvian. - What's his racket?
What's he talking? - Latvian.
No kidding.
I didn't know the Lats had a language.
I thought they just rubbed noses.
You mean you actually speak Latvian?
Just enough to get about.
What does just enough to get about consist of in Latvian?
I don't think you'd have any trouble.
Be a comfort to know when I get to Latvia.
You think there's a chance of you getting to Latvia soon?
Never can tell in my racket.
I suppose you've guessed I'm a foreign correspondent.
Are you?
That's nice.
I see you're taking notes. Are you covering this affair, too?
I sort of work here. Publicity?
You're just the one I'm looking for.
We've got to go in a secret conference right away.
Excuse me.
I beg your pardon, sir.
I have a Latvian friend here... who's particularly interested in the origin of the kilt.
I wonder if you'd be interested in talking to him. He's a lovely fellow.
It's a most amazing story.
You see, the Greeks, in the early period, they used to wear a kilt.
Now, what is this big secret conference all about?
It's no secret as far as I'm concerned. However, I'll let you in on that later.
Since you're handling publicity here, give me a line on what it's about... this league for peace and understanding.
Just what is it you'd like to know?
In the first place, is this Mr. Fisher entirely on the level?
Very much so.
Seems like a very nice guy.
He is, I assure you.
What is it that makes him or you think that an organization like this... made up of well-meaning amateurs... buck up against those tough military boys of Europe?
It's the well-meaning amateurs, you should call them who do the fighting when the war comes.
Luncheon is served.
Please don't go yet.
You don't want those dreary chicken patties. I'm sorry.
I must go.
Then sit at the press table with me.
Nobody ever listens to the speeches, and we could talk.
After all, You don't even know my name yet.
Is it necessary?
It is to me.
Don't mind if you hear it's Huntley Haverstock... because it's really Jones.
What's yours?
Mine's really Smith.
Don't mind if you hear it's anything else.
Waiter? - Yes, sir.
Same young lady. Try again.
I've taken the young lady 13 notes, sir. She won't accept any more.
Milords, ladies and gentlemen... pray silence for your chairman...
Mr. Stephen Fisher.
Ladies and gentlemen, I have an announcement to make... which I'm sure will be a great disappointment to us all.
I've just received this telegram from Mr. Van Meer... who was to have been our guest of honor today.
Deeply regret. Called away suddenly owing to unforeseen circumstances.
And I will be unable to attend your meeting as planned.
I am with you and your work with all my heart.
I could not have said more had I been there."
Although this removes one of our star attractions of the luncheon... we may, as a result, have more time to tell you from the inside... just what this party has stood for and why we've asked you here today.
I can think of no one more competent to do this... than the speaker I'm about to introduce.
I trust you won't think this a family affair... when I say that I refer to my daughter Miss Carol Fisher.
Milords, ladies and gentlemen... pray silence for Miss Carol Fisher.
Ladies and gentlemen...
I trust, even making allowances for a father's exuberance... you do not think I'm in any way being put forward today... as a substitute for Mr. Van Meer.
Unhappily for us, no one can take Mr. Van Meer's place.
What I can do possibly is to clear up a few misapprehensions... that have seems to have crept into the public discussion of this movement... and revise some of the epithets that have been applied to us... by some who have not gone as deeply into the matter as they might.
The female of the species is deadlier than the male.
...as a group of well-meaning amateurs.
Now, I'm sure there's some of you here today who think of us as such.
I'd like to ask anyone who has called us well-meaning amateurs... to stand up on the chair and tell me just why a well-meaning amateur... is any less reliable than a well-meaning professional at a moment like this.
But I'll not take the time.
The world's been run long enough by the well-meaning professional.
We might give the amateurs a chance now.
But what I really want to do is to give you a very brief idea of... just how far-reaching our amateur plans are.
Use your notes.
And just... why we ask for your support... professional or amateur.
What I mean to say is that, however much one may...
I mean, we should both...
Both of us...
Tell them to wait in there.
Mr. Fisher, how are you?
Hello, Haverstock, When did you get over? Just now.
I had a cable from Mr.Powers. This conference is my first assignment.
An ironic assignment, the first one is.
A peace conference under the shadow of war.
Is it really coming?
Today and tomorrow will tell. There's still hope for us. I'm going back to London today.
Leaving for London? I just got here.
I mean the conference is just beginning.
Today and tomorrow the work for peace is in London rather than Amsterdam.
You're taking your whole staff back to London with you, including your... No.
I have someone staying here who'll give you all the help you need.
You'll be in very good hands.
Here she is.
Mr. Haverstock.
We met at the luncheon. You remember him, don't you.
He's nice, but I still can't understand him.
Dr. Williamson, this is Huntley Haverstock of the New York Globe.
He's unfamiliar with Amsterdam and the machinery of peace meetings.
Would you be good enough to take him under your wing?
Perhaps you'll both see that he samples Dutch cheese... at dinner tonight. Now will you please excuse me?
I must see what unlucky person will give up his seat on the London plane. Don't get into any mischief, will you?
Mischief?
Your first visit to Amsterdam? - Yes.
You must let me take you to Rembrandt's house...
It might be a good idea if we went over the agenda of the conference with him. If you'll excuse me.
I think I see a friend.
Mr. Van Meer. How are you?
We somehow seemed to lose each other day before yesterday.
I'm so sorry you were called away.
Don't you remember me?
We shared the same cab together on the way to the luncheon.
Excuse me.
May I have your picture, Mr. Van Meer?
Thank you.
There he goes!
He's getting away!
Follow that car, quick!
You'd better get out of here. Might be dangerous.
Don't be silly. Drive on.
Who has he shot? - Van Meer assassinated.
Dead?
Looked like it.
Couldnt be worse from his viewpoint.
Do you mind shoving your knees out of the way.
You better hop in the back, old girl.
Hurry.
Safety glass. I wonder whose make.
Good chauffeur you've got. - Yes, isn't he?
You know each other?
This is Scott ffolliott, newspaperman, same as you. Foreign correspondent.
Mr. Haverstock, Mr. Folliott.
With a double "F."
How do you do?
I don't get the double "F." They're at the beginning.
Both small "F's".
They can't be at the beginning.
One of my ancestors was beheaded by Henry Vlll.
His wife dropped the capital letter to commemorate it. There it is.
How do you say it, like a stutter?
Just a straight "fuh."
It's stopped raining.
Surs coming up. - The police are coming.
It's the most amazing disappearing trick I've ever seen.
You don't suppose they could've got up that high, do you?
Vanished.
Take a look for yourself.
Tell him your name with the small "F"s.
That'll be a bit over his head.
This isn't catching any assassins.
We should have kept a policeman and played bridge.
I guess you're right.
I'll bet 2-to-1 on the derby.
Look at those sails on that windmill.
You'll get used to those when you've been in Holland longer.
I was sure they were going against the wind.
Why don't you lie down on the grass and cool off?
I'll cool off in due time. First I want you to do me a favour.
Get the police back here.
The police again?
We don't want them. - I won't be prosecuting. - No...
Get the police, our man is inthere.
Where? - In that mill.
What makes you think so?
A lot of things can happen while I'm explaining.
Please take my word for it. Get the police.
I'd go myself if I spoke the language.
What will you do?
A little bit of snooping. I hate to seem executive.
But this is serious.
Come on, Scott.
All right. You shall have your police.
It's a signal.
It's a signal for that plane to land.
Come in and close the door, mister.
Why, Mr. Van Meer.
It isn't possible.
I've just been given a drug.
Drug of some sort.
But I saw you shot just outside the conference hall. I saw it!
They gave it to me... when they moved me from...
It's beginning now.
But the man I saw shot was a dead image.
The man you saw shot, it wasnt me.
He was a... substitute that looked like me. But why?
What...
They want the world to think... that I've been assassinated.
Yes. To conceal the fact... - that I'm in their hands.
Their hands? Who are they?
I can't explain. I'm not certain.
I can hardly think.
All that I can tell you... is that they are going to take me away by plane... like a bird.
Always there are places in the city... where birds can get crumbs.
Quick.
A pencil.
Old mill.
Up the road.
Look.
Man.
Old mill.
Understand?
Does anyone here speak English?
We speak English in the school. O,honey...
Why have you been holding out on me?
Look, tell these two policemen to come with me.
Very, very important. Big old prisoner. Old mill.
Tell them to follow me. Do you understand?
That's what I've been trying to tell you. Come on.
They've gone.
They've killed him.
But it isn't...
Who are you?
Where are the others?
There's been a frame-up. Ask him where the others have gone.
He doesn't know what you're talking about. There are no other people.
And in any case, he's been asleep here all day.
He's lying. I talked to Van Meer in this very room.
There's one thing I can show you. The assassins' car.
The one we followed.
Rather a unique specimen, old boy. The only one horsepower car in the world.
I don't care what you say. That car was here.
Listen, I know I look a fool, but there's something fishy going on.
There's a big story in this. I can smell it, I can feel it.
I am going to get to the bottom of it, if it's the last thing I do.
Nothing's going to stop me. Do you understand?
I am going to prove that it wasnt Van Meer that was assassinated, but his double.
Who is it?
All right. Come in.
Mr. Haverstock?
Yes.
What are you, the house detective?
You werent announced.
I'm sorry, sir. We asked at the desk.
Policemen?
Dont tell me you're here to apologize about the windmill.
We simply want you to come with us and tell your story to our chief of police.
Now, lets get this straight. Does this chief of police speak English, because I'm a very busy man.
It will take no more than half an hour.
We all speak English.
That's marvelous.
That's more than I can say for my country.
Would you sit down for just a moment?
I have to make a phone call.
Dinner date with a young lady.
The exchange doesn't answer. I'll call later.
Look, I'm a very quick bather.
Would you excuse me while I jump in the tub and have a quick shave?
Look at some magazines. I'll be right back.
You can't you bring the chief of police here?
No, I am afraid not.
I thought not.
Please don't bother to come.
You'll find it on my dressing table.
We meet again.
So it seems.
Quite a lot's happened since I last saw you.
So I see.
I had quite a chase after that guy outside Amsterdam.
It's quite a country. It's interesting. Windmills and tulips.
Did you find everything you...
We were just talking about the tulips. Don't seem to be any.
I really think I should be going now.
Thank you very much for the powder.
Must you really go now?
Yes, I must be going now. Really.
Goodbye.
You've made quite a day of it, haven't you?
Making fools of Scott ffolliott and me, breaking into my bedroom... and disgracing me before a friend of my father's.
What are your plans now?
You might at least have clothes on.
Take it easy. This is serious.
I've got to talk to you.
I've seen your serious business.
What're you doing here? - I'm escaping.
Escaping from what?
From some fellows in my room about to kill me.
May I ask who?
Two gentlemen disguised as policemen, waiting to take me for a ride.
Dont you think you're talking through your hat.
I'm not talking through my hat.
I've thrown a monkey wrench into some international dirty business, whatever it is.
I know Van Meer's alive. That's the reason they want to kill me.
I can think of others.
Now look, You've got to help me. Not for my sake alone... but this is the biggest story in Europe.
Your childish mind is out of place in Europe as you are in my bedroom.
Get over there.
You see what you're doing?
All this is going straight back to London and will be common gossip by tomorrow.
I don't care for myself, but my father's engaged in great work.
He's trying to help avert a dreadful war... and this is just the sort of thing to discredit him.
I know you care nothing about our work.
All you're interested in is having fun with windmills and hotel bathrooms.
I take it you don't believe I'm in trouble?
You'll be in lot of trouble if you don't get out.
Now for the last time, please go.
But I want you to know exactly what's going to happen when I do go.
I'll go back to my room, get dressed and try and shake those fellows off... but I won't succeed.
They'll stick to me like a couple of tattoo marks until they get me.
They'll stop at nothing.
I seem to know too much. And you're right.
I don't know much about your crackpot peace movement...
I don't know what's wrong with Europe.
But I know a story when I see one.
I'll keep after it until either I get it or it gets me.
Sorry you have those derogatory opinions of me... but I guess that can't be helped.
So long.
It's been nice knowing you.
I said goodbye.
Don't go.
I guess I could have handled those fellows with a little luck.
We mustnt take any chances. We should get help.
That's what I had in mind, at first.
I'll get Dr. Williamson...
Wait. They might not understand.
They have understood.
We could catch the night boat to England if we could get out. Dont get out.
That's the hitch. What's that friend's name, that "ff"?
Ffolliott.
Get me Mr. Ffolliott's room, please.
Left the hotel?
That's strange. We were to dine together tonight.
He realized how much I meant to you.
You'd mean more with your clothes on.
You like the intellectual type.
Say, I've got an idea. - What?
Give me the manager, please.
Buzz for the valet.
Is this the manager?
This is Mr. Haverstock in 537.
What kind of hotel is this?
My bathtub leaks, phone's out of order, and I've been robbed.
Will you send somebody up right away?
Operator, send a waiter up to 537.
And ask the chambermaid to bring up some clean sheets.
I've set mine on fire.
And I'd like my windows cleaned. And ask boots to come get my shoes. Hurry up.
That's a good girl.
Clutter up that room nicely for those two guys.
It's the valet.
Come in.
Do you speak English? - Yes, sir.
Go to my room, 537... and get me shirt, tie, suit, and a hat.
You see, my husband's waiting in the room for this gentleman.
No sign of them yet. Let's hide ourselves in the cabin.
Full up, sir. Sorry.
Not even a small cabin?
Not a thing. Everybody in a hurry to get home.
I have a rather rare banknote you might be interested in.
It's a memento, that is if you collect rare banknotes.
It's no use, sir. I'd do it if I could, but there just isn't a place left.
On English ships, you come up against such an air of incorruptibility.
As a matter of fact, I've just had a cabin returned.
Can I have your name, sir?
One cabin isn't going to do us much good. We just can't...
I fully intended to sleep in the lounge.
I hope you didn't think I...
No, of course not.
It's very kind of you.
I'll take it.
I'm sorry, sir. I'm afraid it's too late now.
You had some doubt about taking it, so I had to let that gentleman have it.
That's too bad.
It's such a rare £5 note.
The water mark's upside down. I think you'd have loved it.
Well, perhaps next time.
Were you really going to tip that man £5?
Of course. I charge all my traveling expenses to the office.
Corrupting an official, £5.
You're just a wee bit unscrupulous, aren't you?
Not unscrupulous. Just in love.
It's the same thing, I suppose.
I beg your pardon?
I beg yours.
You see, I love you, and I want to marry you.
I love you, and I want to marry you.
That cuts our love scene down quite a bit, doesn't it?
Do you mind? - Not at all.
It's made a new man of me.
I hope not entirely new. It took me some time to get used to the first man you were.
To be perfectly frank with you, I expected a little more argument.
I'm really left with quite a few things I very much wanted to say.
Save them until after we're married. I imagine they'll sound better then.
I've saved things to say then, too.
You were really quite sure of yourself, werent you?
I didn't think I had a chance.
A guy's got a right to dream, hasn't he?
Evidently.
Do you think your father will understand?
I think that Father will be delighted, frankly.
All right, sir.
Good morning, Ms.Carol.
Good morning, Stiles, this is Mr.Haverstock.
Is Father up yet?
Yes, miss. He's having breakfast.
Come on.
Hello, Father.
Carol, What on earth are you doing in London?
Mr. Haverstock brought me back on the boat.
Nothing wrong, isnt it? You're not ill.
You look healthy. - I'm fine.
It's Mr. Haverstock.
I hope you don't mind my barging in like this.
On the contrary, I'm delighted to see you.
You cover a lot of territory, don't you?
You didn't even wire. For that I hope your trip was uncomfortable.
It wasnt so bad.
The boat was crowded, we couldn't get any cabins, but we managed to sleep on the deck.
Monsieur Krug, how nice to see you again.
But you haven't met Mr. Haverstock, Monsieur Krug.
Monsieur Krug is a member of the Baruvian embassy staff.
Sit down, Haverstock. Have breakfast.
I should tidy up, but I'm simply starved.
So you were in Amsterdam yesterday, Mr. Haverstock.
Poor Van Meer. His death is a personal loss.
Of all people, why Van Meer?
You can't ask why with assassins.
There's no logic in killing.
We can't spare such men in a world like ours.
Did you by any chance meet him, Mr. Haverstock?
Not formally, but I saw him die.
Horrible.
As a matter of fact, I chased the man that shot him, and almost caught him.
Mr. Haverstock is a newspaperman.
That'd be quite a coup... bringing in your first story wrapped around an assassin.
I think I shall have to be getting along now, Mr. Fisher.
Shall we write the peace petition now or leave it for later?
We may as well do it straightaway, in the study.
Excuse us.
Father, could I speak to you for a moment?
It's terribly important.
This won't take a moment. Meanwhile, see if you can interest Mr. Haverstock in some eggs and bacon.
Mr. Fisher. What's that man doing here?
Why, it's Monsieur Krug.
Van Meer isn't dead.
I just read...
That was his double that was shot. Van Meer was kidnapped.
I talked to him outside Amsderdam.
What has Monsieur Krug to do with it?
Remember my description of the man in the mill?
You mean the sweater.
That's impossible. We've known Monsieur Krug...
Krug brought Van Meer here last night. He's in England.
They're hiding him.
You're positive?
Of course. I was as close to Krug as I am to you now.
It'd be terrible if we made a mistake. But we can't allow him to...
Leave it to me.
I don't want to be inhospitable, but leave my house.
Mr.Haverstock is going suggest that I turn you over to the police.
Mr.Haverstock seems to be something of a troublemaker.
You said he'd been taken care of by our agents in Amsterdam.
I thought so, too.
I don't understand it. Unless, perhaps, Ms.Fisher's being with him... may have caused complications.
It would've been ideal if she'd been in our confidences.
Please leave my daughter out of it.
I beg your pardon.
Most unfortunate, his coming here. I've never had to cope with this sort of thing before, thanks to you, Krug.
Someone has to take care of the sordid details.
This is close to home. In fact, it is my home.
After all, I'm only a politician.
In a sense. And politicians aren't usually called upon to... do away with their guests, are they?
Quiet, boy.
Not in the house. No, sir.
But I have an idea.
Do you remember Rowley?
The little man that used to work at your father's stables in Austria.
I seem to recall he was present when a mutual friend of ours... accidentally fell off the high bridge at Bern.
He's retired now.
Lives somewhere in Clapham, here in London.
If Mr. Haverstock could be induced... to hire him in the capacity of a private detective.
What for?
You should warn him that it's very dangerous for him... to go about London with the knowledge that he has.
Yes, I see.
You use the English language with great delicacy.
Thank you, sir.
I shall look Mr. Rowley up at once and give him his instructions.
You mustnt. It would be too dangerous.
What do we do now, call Scotland Yard?
I thought it best to send Monsieur Krug away.
You let him get away? Listen...
If what you say is true... then it's important not to rouse Krug's suspicions.
Van Meer will be killed.
Dead or alive, it's a story.
Johnny, father's right.
I'll cable them what I've got.
I wouldn't, if I were you.
Van Meer's life may depend on our keeping this quiet, for a few hours atleast.
Keep it quiet?
A famous diplomat's kidnapped right under my eyes and I muzzle myself?
I'm sorry, but this is a story with facts in it. This is the kind of story I was sent over here to get, this is the kind America's waiting for.
It'll be a bigger story if you can wait a few hours... until we find Van Meer and discover what's behind this whole curious business.
I know what's behind it.
I don't mean who is behind it. I mean the why of it.
Would you get me all my correspondence with Krug?
Please Johnny, Do what Father says.
It'll be best for you and Mr. Van Meer.
Okay.
I'll wait.
I'm worried about you, Mr. Haverstock.
I'm worried about myself. I feel weak-minded.
You're right. I don't like you dashing about without some protection.
Forget it.
If you're right, you need protection.
I've covered beer mob killings and race riots... without even carrying a rabbit's foot.
These people are criminals... more dangerous than your rumrunners and house-breakers.
They're fanatics.
They combine a mad love of country with an equally mad indifference to life... their own, as well as others'.
They're cunning, unscrupulous and inspired.
I couldn't face Mr. Powers again if you didn't live long enough... to turn in the best story of the year.
I'm gonna be a fine foreign correspondent hiding in an attic.
I'm not suggesting you hide anywhere. Just get somebody to protect you. A nurse?
Johnny Jones goes to Europe and hires a nurse.
That's going to look great on the expense account.
I know a very efficient detective agency where we can get just the man.
Okay. Whatever you say.
I can arrange it all for you.
If you'll feel better, I won't mention it to anybody.
Mention it.
If anyone finds out I've hired a bodyguard, I'll shoot myself.
If that's Mr. Rowley, tell him to wait outside.
I've called on Mr. Haverstock. Will you tell him Mr. Rowley's here. - Yes.
Will you wait here, please?
Mr. Haverstock, your cab's here.
Where are you going?
To the office, I've got work to do.
You mustnt go.
I was sent over here at great expenses as a newspaperman, not a refugee.
How about lunch at the Savoy?
I'll see you out.
Johnny, please be careful.
I'll be all right.
Is this the man?
Look, who's protecting who?
I ain't lanky, but I'm quick.
You understand what you have to do?
You can trust me to take good care of Mr. Haverstock.
Are we going now, sir?
Take me down to my office in Fleet Street...
and if you're good, to the American Club. - Right, sir.
You'll keep after this other thing?
When there's any definite news of our friend, you can break the story.
Goodbye.
Why, Carol.
Nothing must happen to him, Father.
I just couldn't...
How do we go, sir?
Should I walk a little behind you, or beside you, like a friend?
What's the custom?
People have different tastes.
When I served the Duke of Albertson, a democratic sort of gent...
I used to walk alongside of him, man-to-man like.
On the other hand, I once had a lady who thought that was disrespectful.
Three paces behind," she said. "And don't smoke on duty."
What's good for a duke is good enough for me. We can work as a team.
Thank you.
If we want to go to the American Club, we'd better take a cab.
There's one.
What's the trouble, sir?
Gangsters after you?
Not exactly.
We're not afraid of gangsters here.
Even our police don't carry guns.
What do they do?
Biff you over the head with a stick. It's more healthy-like.
Did you see that?
Someone deliberately pushed me.
That was me.
If I'd pulled you back, you'd have been caught.
It was push or nothing.
That's smart work, Mr. Rowley.
That's what I'm here for.
Taxi!
American Club. - Yes, sir.
I'm not certain, sir... but I've got an idea two men took another cab to follow us.
I don't see anyone suspicious.
I may have been mistaken... but I'm almost certain I saw them.
They may have heard where we're going.
Driver.
Go down Victoria Street, round past Buckingham Palace.
We might give them the slip if we go the long way around.
I'm afraid they're still after us. Our best plan is to pull around the corner and change cabs.
Driver, take the first to your left and pull up.
We're going to walk a bit.
I'll do it, sir. I understand the money.
I think our best plan is to slip into the cathedral for a bit.
Let's stop this ducking out of sight. Let them catch up and have a showdown.
No, I wouldn't cause a scene.
Our job is to give them the slip.
All right. Let's go.
Nice bit of architecture, sir.
Do you want to go right in?
I saw on the notice it was a requiem mass. A mass for the dead.
That sort of thing always depresses me, praying for the dead.
The dead are all right in their place... but the music and candles always give me the creeps.
Just really, sir. I could be so frightened, sir, I...
How about a trip up top, sir?
That'd really put them off the scent.
Boys, careful there.
I can't see.
Here, here.
There you are, my boy!
There it goes. There!
I'll have to buy you another now.
Careful, boys.
You better be careful, too, sir.
Not yet, boys. Come.
Let's get out of here. I have a luncheon date and plenty to do before.
I've got it in mind, don't you worry.
Really, now. Look. Isn't it worthwhile coming up here?
There's the Houses of Parliament there.
And there's St. James' Park. That green patch. Yeah.
You must excuse me getting scared when you leaned over just now, sir.
I was once with a man on a bridge in Switzerland.
He had a very nasty fall.
Killed him. Stone dead.
Always made me a bit nervous since.
Don't go down just yet, sir.
I'd like you to see St. Paul's.
There it is, just coming out of the mist.
There's the horse guards approaching Buckingham Palace. See them?
It makes the back of me legs go funny.
Heights always did.
Let's get down again, Eric.
We've just come up. Why didn't you say so before? Excuse me.
I know just how you feel.
Them as has no head for heights. Nobody ought not to blame them.
What's it got to do with you? I 'd like to know.
All right, keep your hair on. I was only sympathizing with the lady.
I'm going down anyway. - Wait for the lift.
No.
No stairs for me. I'm going to take the elevator.
Wait a minute, sir.
You ain't seen the horse guards yet.
You must see the horse guards, sir.
I don't see anything.
Why, there they are, sir.
Down the road.
Just going towards... the white building.
No, boys. This way.
There but for the grace of God.
I still don't know what instinct made me step aside when he came at me.
You need a drink.
I heard the lift coming up, and I turned.
I saw that look in his eyes as he came toward me.
That split second, the whole thing flashed through my mind.
All I could think of was Fisher.
Fisher planned this.
Then I guess I just stepped aside and over he went.
Over he went all right.
You want this?
No, thanks.
When are you going to send the story to the gazette?
When I get ready.
There goes another one of my illusions. I thought you were one of the journalists nothing could stop.
Floods, smallpox, love: The story must go on.
It'll go on.
I can understand you not wanting to drag Miss Fisher into it... but she's probably in it already.
You dirty...
On second thought, I'm sure she's a fine girl... upstanding, honest, and a great soul.
I can't send the story over until Van Meer's safe.
We got to find Van Meer first.
There's our man now, probably. Mr. Van Meer, come in.
Good morning, Stebbins.
How are you, Haverstock?
Congratulations on your little set-to with Rowley.
What do you know about Rowley?
Very little ffolliott doesn't hear. Probably knows about Fisher.
I was onto Fisher a year ago.
The fellow with the high neck sweater, Krug, he's new to me.
You're onto him, too?
I followed him to London.
I thought you were cold on this story.
I've been doing some noticing.
Remember that tramp you found asleep in the mill?
He wasnt a tramp at all.
Van Meer, I suppose.
Not quite.
But I notice him do a strange thing for a tramp.
He dirtied his hands with some of that nasty Dutch soil.
I can't follow the workings of these masterminds.
Tell him it's ridiculous.
You'd already disappeared, so I followed Krug... but found the same old mousetrap.
You mean Fisher?
The good, kind... genial head of the Peace Party, Herr Fisher.
Hello, Eddy. This is Plunger Stebbins.
I want to place a bet on Flibbertigibbet in the first race... What?
The race is over?
Okay, I'll call you later.
Any objection to our working this thing together?
Catch Fisher, find Van Meer?
Fine, but I'd like to know why they kidnapped Van Meer in the first place.
He was one of the signatories to a certain treaty.
The most important clause was never written down... just memorized by the two people who signed it.
And they'll beat it out of him?
They'll try hard enough, and it's a good idea to stop them.
It contains a piece of information very valuable to the enemy... in the war that starts tomorrow, weather permitting. What?
Why didn't somebody let me in on this?
Stebbins, let's get busy.
Plenty of time. Lunch first.
Wait a minute. You might be of some help.
I thought up a little plan for forcing Fisher's hand.
Let's have it.
I think The neatest thing to do would be to kidnap Fisher's daughter.
One of his few genuine traces of affection is for Miss Fisher. Easy.
You're speaking to a man in love. Good.
Gives you a chance to get chummy, to keep her happy at your side... while we batter old Papa.
This is my little scheme.
I let Fisher know that his daughter is in the hands of someone... who means business just as he does when he kidnaps people...
Nothing doing.
Arent you a newspaperman?
That doesn't include kidnapping fiancées.
It would, if your country were at stake.
This isn't my country.
It's your story. Don't be gloomy about it.
She doesn't have to know what you're doing.
Keep her amused for a few hours.
Why not grab Fisher, have a showdown?
That's no good.
We've got nothing on Fisher. He'd slip out of it.
He has been for years.
We'd merely kill Van Meer.
Darling, are you all right? Why were you doing up there on the tower?
Keeping out of harm, I thought.
Those assassins followed, there was a scuffle, and over he went.
They won't stop till they get you.
You must leave London immediately.
The one thing everybody forgets is that I'm a reporter. - And there's a war.
I can't run from it.
He can't stay here. - Tell him how desperate they are.
Don't stay here, why don't you take him?
I won't go.
Isn't there some maiden aunt in the country?
My Aunt Margaret. Let me take you there.
How about it?
Stay out of this.
It's the only sensible thing to do.
May I use your telephone?
Hello, Stiles. Miss Carol speaking.
Would you tell Mr. Fisher I'm driving to my Aunt Margaret's at Harpenden.
I don't care what you arrange. I won't go.
It's all settled. We'll get you a toothbrush.
Carol, it's no good.
I wonder if this idea of your aunt is so good.
Maybe you should go further, say, Cambridge.
No place is as obscure as Harpenden.
It's not the place, but that Krug might connect you with it.
Maybe so. Let's make it Cambridge.
I'll phone your father so he doesn't worry.
Please, Johnny.
That was a break, her walking in like that, and suggesting they go to the country.
As a matter of fact, old boy... I suggested it to her on the phone about half an hour ago.
There hasn't been a sign of anybody for the last 30 miles.
What's the matter?
Nothing.
At least talk to me.
It's unfair of you to sit and pout... because I've kidnapped you from your so-called duties.
You've kidnapped me?
Just remember that.
Please forgive me.
Sure.
I don't think kidnapping's anything to get sore about... - when the right kidnapper does it.
Do you? - Not at all.
Thanks.
Hello?
No, Mr. Ffolliott, I'm afraid he's not in yet.
Very well, sir.
Johnny, you don't love me.
You're crazy.
You looked unhappy kissing me.
Never happier in my life. Wont do.
Johnny, what's happened?
I don't know. The war, I guess.
They say war's coming tomorrow.
You've changed your philosophy since yesterday.
There are more important things than love.
I've got lots to do, important things.
Got to start. It'll take three hours to get back.
Don't misunderstand me.
I'm so in love with you, that I'm going mad.
Wont do.
I suppose it can't be helped.
You've turned European overnight.
That's unfair.
I'm just as big a jackass as ever. Bigger.
You're not going back to London to dinner tonight.
You can't run out on your kidnapper like that.
I mean, well you know what I mean.
If you leave, I'll go back to London and let them bump me off.
It'll be a relief at that.
You are moody. Am I the cause of it?
If you knew how much I loved you, you'd faint.
What'd I tell you?
Come in.
Call from London.
Have them switch it here.
The only phone here is in the office.
All right. I'll come down.
Forgive me for a moment, dear.
Just a moment, sir.
Hello?
Is that you, Haverstock?
Are you alone?
Can you talk?
I can't reach Fisher.
He's been out all afternoon.
I am afraid you'll have to keep the girl there much longer than we planned.
I don't know when he'll return. I've got to catch him alone.
Better keep her there for the rest of the night.
That's absolutely impossible.
We can't let this thing go now.
I can't very well explain, but I simply couldn't pull a thing like that.
Trial, boy. There isnt anything else to be done. I'm counting on you.
Hello?
Are you quite satisfied with your room, sir?
Not exactly. I mean, yes...
But what I really wanted was another room as well.
Mr. Naysmith, this gentleman wants another room.
Is it for the lady and how long do you need it?
She'll only be here just the one night.
The gentleman has Number 7.
What about Number 8?
It doesn't really make any difference. Just a good room, windows and all that.
I understand.
Perhaps the room next to yours would be best.
It's quite a cozy room, isn't it, Number 8?
They're all alike to me, sir.
Eight will do.
Will you bring the lady down to sign the book, please?
Yes, I'll get her.
Terrible thing, sir, that poor man who was here this morning.
Yes, terrible. My bags all packed?
What about Miss Carol's?
Mrs. Stiles packed hers, too.
She hopes she's put in the right things.
It's been a rush, as she's not back yet.
Mr. Ffolliott's waiting in the sitting room.
Another gentleman phoned, but wouldn't leave his name.
I thought I recognized his voice. Sounded like the foreign gentleman at breakfast.
Did he say he'd telephone again?
Yes. He said it was urgent.
Well, show Mr. Ffolliott into the study.
Hello, sir.
You caught me at a very busy moment.
I'm going to America tomorrow.
Are you taking Carol with you?
Yes, she doesn't know yet. It's been a rush.
I'm waiting for her to come in now.
Scott, what's your worry?
Must be important.
Yes, it is rather important. It's about Carol. - I'm afraid that...
Anything happen to her?
No, but I don't think you'll be able to take her with you to America.
Why not?
I know it'll sound rather silly to you, but Carol's been kidnapped.
Is this a joke of some sort?
No, sir.
What do you mean, kidnapped?
I happen to know she's with her aunt in Harpenden.
I'm afraid she isn't.
Who gave you the message that Miss Carol's gone to her Aunt Margaret's?
Miss Carol herself, sir.
That's where she thought she was going.
Get me Harpenden, 43422.
Hello. Is that you, Margaret?
Is Carol with you?
No.
I wasnt certain. She said she might be running down to see you.
I didn't know whether to expect her back for dinner.
Good night, Margaret.
No, she isn't there.
What makes you say she's been kidnapped?
Sir, I arranged it.
Ffolliott, this has gone far enough. Where is Carol?
Carol's being held as a sort of hostage... by some people who are very much in earnest... as much in earnest as you are.
Don't be so cryptic. I haven't the faintest idea what you are talking about.
I want to know where you're hiding Van Meer.
So that's it.
You've been talking with that American, Haverstock. He was here this morning. He told me something about Van Meer being alive.
You promised Haverstock you'd look into it.
Naturally.
Unusual way of looking into it, trying to put him out of the way.
I realize a life's a small matter, the way you work.
The people who've got Carol can take a leaf out of your book.
Where is she? What've you done with her?
Where's Van Meer?
I can get our Dutch friend to talk if you come along yourself.
Sorry to drag you here, but it's the only way if you want to leave tomorrow.
When you get here, ask at the cashier's desk to use the phone.
They'll show you straight up.
Very well, I'll drop in as soon as I can.
If you want Carol to go with you to America, better tell me where Van Meer is.
Bring her here, I'll give you the address.
Carol can be home in three hours.
I want that address now.
I give my word. You can have it as soon as Carol's home.
I can't possibly wait three hours.
Besides, I happen to want Van Meer alive.
Scott, I delivered him all right.
I think I'll be getting along.
Thanks very much for those points.
Can I take them now?
Good night, Carol.
This isn't like you. What is it that upsets you so?
I know I'm being silly. I'm behaving perfectly stupidly.
Please forgive me.
I wouldn't mind so much... but I didn't think he was that sort of person.
Something to do with young Haverstock?
You like him very much.
After what happened, I drove him to the country... to get him away from those people.
I thought you were going to Aunt Margaret's.
We were, but Scott ffolliott... thought it would be better to go further away.
So I thought The College Arms at Cambridge would be a good place.
When we got there, I found out that he wanted...
You see, we'd been joking about it.
When I heard him book the extra room, I knew he meant it.
Cheap trick. That's what hurts.
It was so cheap.
It wasnt at all like I thought it was.
What difference does it make, I don't care if I ever see him again.
You won't have to. We're going to America tomorrow by clipper.
Tomorrow?
But I can't.
I suppose I can, but why tomorrow?
It's our last chance.
War will be declared tomorrow.
We have to get to Washington. The boats will be crowded.
We may have to wait two weeks for passage.
But what about Mr. Van Meer?
We've done all we could.
I was at the foreign office.
They're taking the whole thing over.
What is it? - The blackout.
I have to draw the blinds.
I forgot.
Before you do that, order me a taxi.
There are some people I must see before we leave.
I shouldn't be long.
Mrs. Stiles has done your packing.
We'll drive to Southampton by car, stay overnight at the Southwestern.
Stiles, my hat, please.
I'll return as soon as possible. Meanwhile, you and Stiles load the car and get something to eat.
But what about you?
I'll get a sandwich later.
242 Charlotte Street, at the top of Tottenam Court Road.
Wait here until Haverstock turns up. He's bound to come here.
As soon as he arrives, bring him to 242, Charlotte Street... off of Tottenam Court Road.
Be careful.
Might I use your telephone?
This way, sir.
Where is he?
In there. We can't make him say anything. I am afraid it's up to you.
Let's go.
Is this place safe?
There'll be no interruptions. We close it for decorations.
The people downstairs?
They won't make trouble.
They know what will happen to their relatives if they do.
It's an attractive nest, I know, and the music...
It serves its purpose.
Put your arm around him.
Hold his head forward.
These lights, can't you cut them down?
I thank you.
I thank you very much.
You're like my friend Mr. Fisher.
I'm sorry.
It's just so dark...
I can't tell... but you are so like my friend.
I am Fisher, Mr. Van Meer.
I am your friend.
I'm so glad.
Are the police here?
They mustrt get away.
You mustnt let these people go.
Pardon me, Gentlemen. I represent Jupiter Life Insurance.
Would you like a small policy?
Why did you bring him up here?
I didn't know what to do.
I'd gladly relieve the lady of this embarrassment.
You know how women are with firearms, no sense of timing.
I'll just sit here. You carry on with what you were doing.
Don't mind me.
I sometimes sit like this for hours.
Who's that?
Is it the police?
Tell me where I am.
You are in London, Mr. Van Meer.
In London?
Have I been here long?
You must send a telegram to my wife.
Tell her that I am safe with you.
Please try to understand, Mr. Van Meer.
The police are not here.
I am here merely to talk to you.
But these people...
They think I'm working with them. They don't know that I'm your friend.
We must play a little game.
A little game?
They've asked me to get you to tell me... what they're trying to find out.
But I can't do that. You know that I can't.
You can tell me.
Just that one clause in the treaty.
Clause 27.
Clause 27.
Come, Mr. Van Meer.
That's the secret clause.
I know it, Clause 27.
But they, they mustnt know it.
It would help them if they make war.
War, Fisher.
You don't want them helped, do you?
Of course not.
Just let them see you telling it to me. That'll be enough.
Let them see you whisper it to me. I'll promise to keep it safe.
He's not your friend, Mr. Van Meer. Don't tell him.
Who's that?
Someone just said you werent my friend.
Why didn't you bring the police?
Why aren't you taking me away from here?
You are not to take me away.
Where are you?
Help me.
I see now.
There's no help. No help... for the whole poor suffering world.
You cry peace, Fisher. Peace.
And there was no peace.
Only war and death.
You're a liar, Fisher.
A cruel liar.
You can do what you want with me.
That's not important.
But you'll never conquer them, Fisher.
Little people everywhere... who give crumbs to birds.
Lie to them.
Drive them, whip them... force them into war.
When the beasts like you... will devour each other... then the world... will belong to the little people.
We're wasting valuable time.
All right. I will tell you...
I will tell everything.
Come on, Mr. Fisher.
In the event of invasion by an enemy...
Why, it's only a restaurant.
Look!
Come on!
This way. Down the back stairs.
They must've gone the other way. Look after him.
You're a blithering idiot if you don't nab Fisher... before he boards that plane.
Dont be a fool. How can we arrest him without any evidence?
You're obstinate. Isn't Van Meer proof enough?
No, and you ought to know it.
What proof is there against Fisher personally?
Of all the conceited, stupid numbskull...
Stop behaving like a boy scout and let us handle this.
Ask McKenna to come in.
Go see Dr. Boniface.
He's very good for nerves.
Identification of Van Meer complete?
Yes. He's unconscious, but there's no doubt it's Van Meer.
You'd better get back.
Take somebody along to get a statement when he comes to.
Meanwhile, keep an eye on that flying boat... await instructions from us.
What's the good of being related to Scotland Yard?
My fool brother won't do anything.
Scotland Yard can't solve my problems.
Everyone's in on it but me.
You're in it, too. We are going to get on that plane to keep an eye on fisher.
While we're driving... - ring Mayfair 24574.
Let me write that.
Mayfair 24574. That's my cousin. He's the director of the airline.
Tell him we need two seats on tomorrow's clipper to America.
Then go to Hilton Nursing Home and stick by Van Meer.
Then phone Miss Edith Armbruster, Kensington 66255. Tell her I'm off to America.
Will she dine with me next Monday instead of tomorrow?
Sure.
Then call up Stevens at the Post. Tell him I'm off to America.
Cable New York, tell them I'm off to America.
Ring up the Crescent Dancing Academy and cancel my rumba lesson.
Two ham sandwiches on rye bread.
There's no use in my waiting around.
It's hard to say how soon he'll recover.
It may be some hours before he can speak.
Frankly Inspector, I don't know much about this, but my friend's on the clipper.
If Van Meer speaks, they'll send word to the plane.
Did you hear the wireless?
War is declared!
Read all about it.
War declared!
It's war with Germany!
I found that picture.
Steward, bring me one of those, please.
Yes, sir.
Any message for me?
What name?
Is there a message for me?
I'll be with you in a minute.
This one's for me. - Yes, sir.
Lovely, isn't it?
Sort of makes you forget all about the war and troubles.
It would be nice if we could keep flying for a long time, live in the clouds.
Yes, it would be very nice.
It's time for me to make a landing, a forced landing.
What's the matter?
Anything happen?
I've got to talk to you. I don't want to, but I've got to.
The hardest part is talking to you now.
I don't mind about the rest.
It's about Krug and Van Meer.
You've guessed.
Not till last night.
I've been worried... but I believed in you.
You shouldn't.
It's true, then, what I wouldn't believe?
I'm to be arrested when we land... as a spy, shipped back to London.
It's quite all right, except, just the one phase of it.
You.
That's why I've got to talk to you.
I should like for you to see a little from my point of view... it might help you afterwards.
First about yourself, my deceiving you.
I didn't want you involved in any part because you're English... half-English anyway.
I'm not. I'm just coated with an English accent.
A thin coat.
I fought for my country in my heart in a very difficult way.
Sometimes it's harder to fight dishonorably than nobly in the open.
I used my country's methods because I was born with them.
I don't intend on making this plea to the court-martial.
I'm making it only to my daughter whom I loved dearly... and before whom I feel a little ashamed.
What you say to me now means more to me than any other verdict.
Steward, this is not for me.
It was a mistake.
I'm not going to sit here for another 14 hours playing hide-and-seek with her.
I'm going to talk to her.
It can't do any harm, now that he knows we're aboard.
Not a word in front of her, understand?
I wouldn't dream of talking.
What will you say to her?
I don't know.
I'm all mixed up.
I love her, and I'm going to help hang her father.
I've got to say something. I'll go crazy.
Have some brandy. You'll feel better.
You know it always makes me cry harder.
Surprised?
What are you doing here?
Having myself a ride.
Carol, I've got to speak to you alone. It's very important.
Do you mind, Mr. Fisher?
Ffolliott's with you, isn't he?
In a way, yes.
You're both after my father.
You're having him arrested when we land, aren't you?
I don't know what you are talking about.
I never arrested anyone in my life.
That's a lie.
You've followed him from the beginning.
That's why you wanted me out of the way at the inn... pretended you loved me so you could...
It's a lie, that's all. Everything you've said to me have been lies.
Quite a reunion, isn't it?
You, too?
Please. Have a drink, Scott.
I'll be back.
Where are you going?
To stretch my legs.
I read that wire you received.
It was given to me by mistake.
That's all right, sir.
You're not going unless I go with you.
I know you both think my father is a traitor and a renegade.
He isn't. Not to me.
Thank you. A minority report, but very welcome.
Carol, I've got nothing to do with spies.
I'm just a reporter. I came here after a story.
I'm sorry I ever heard of Van Meer.
I'd blow up the Globe, cut Powers' throat rather than doing anything that'll harm you.
What is it?
They've gone crazy. What are they doing? Who are they?
Call Bob. Tell him we're being attacked.
Sorry about this, ffolliott. It has nothing to do with me.
You're the most cool-headed woman I've ever seen.
Make Father wear this.
Here you are. Put these on.
Come out, sir.
They're all going nuts in there.
I'll be out immediately.
What am I going to say?
This isn't like bad weather.
Tell them it's a mistake, that it's target practice.
I know it's funny for me to ask you to be calm.
We're doing the best we can.
Keep away from that window, sir.
It might be dangerous.
I'm not going to put this on.
I've never heard of anything so stupid.
I'll see the British Consul as soon as I...
She's gone.
What in the name of heaven are they doing?
Switch off the gas. You've got the other board motor.
They got the other starboard motor. Cut that off too?
It's the Germans. They're sorry.
They thought we were a bomber.
She'll rescue us straight-away.
The wings are off.
Let me get out!
Come away from that door.
We can't just stay here.
When she hits the water, the tail's the best place.
Come on.
No good staying on here, she's going under.
Quick, onto the wing.
Look, there's the pilot.
Don't let him on, you fools!
We'll go down.
Shut your mouth!
I'm throwing that swine off.
He's right.
It won't hold us. I'd better slip away.
I'll move to the other end. That might make it lighter here.
He's gone!
Johnny, don't go! You'll be washed away!
Johnny, come back!
Must be the enemy coming to pick us up.
Is it the enemy?
We're all right. She's American.
American ship "Mohican" picked us all up and is taking us back to London.
I can't tell you what happened. We are not allowed to give out anything.
I'll wire from London in a few days. Bye.
It's awkward, I just spoke to the captain.
He insists on acting the true blue neutral.
Enemy waters," he says. Not a line to the press from his ship.
Can't send out any stories?
We can use the phone for private messages.
Hello, Aunt Effie, safe aboard the Mohican.
Two days before we get to London, we get scooped on our own story.
Why dont you have a crack at brass buttons.
What's the use? Even if he says okay... what good will it do me? My hands are tied.
What are you talking about?
Carol.
I came 4,000 miles to get a story.
I get shot at like a duck. I got pushed off buildings.
I get the story, then I got to shut up.
What are you grinning at?
I'm sincere. I'm not throwing her father up for grabs.
He died like a hero to save her and the rest of us.
I'm talking through my hat.
The whole point is, he was her father.
I won't play Judas to the only girl...
I'm very glad you said that.
You all dry and everything? - I'm all right.
Johnny, I want you to send the whole story.
We'll talk about that later.
No, Please. I dont want you to feel that way.
You can't help me by protecting my father.
Listen, I'm in love with you. I can't hit you with a scandal for a wedding present.
My father fought for his country his way.
It wasnt a straight way, but it was a hard way.
And I've got to fight for my country a hard way.
Okay, if that's the way you feel about it.
I guess that's for me. I put in a call to my uncle, Uncle Powers.
Johnny Jones is on the line. He is calling from the Mohican.
What's he doing there? Wait a minute.
Johnny wouldn't call if it wasnt a story. Listen.
Tell them to hold the presses. Send Bradley in here.
Tell him we're breaking up Page 1.
Hello, Mr. Powers.
This is Johnny Jones.
Ease your voice. Here comes the captain.
Mr. Powers, keep your ear glued to this phone and don't hang up.
Mr. Haverstock, I want to talk with you.
Yes, sir.
I just found out you're a newspaperman.
That's right.
Why didn't you tell me that when I questioned you?
You lied to me.
My dear Captain... when you have been shot down in a British plane by a German destroyer... 300 miles off the coast of England, Latitude 45... have been hanging on a half-submerged wing for hours... waiting to drown with half a dozen other stricken human beings... you're liable to forget that you're a newspaperman for a moment or two.
You'll have to forget it for as long as you're on this ship.
I can't understand your attitude, sir.
You performed a heroic rescue, Captain John Martin.
You took us all out of the sea.
You're not sending anything from this ship.
Thats final.
You're absolutely right, Captain. We mustnt do anything to embarrass the United States government.
Exactly. That's my point.
That's the story I've got. You dont want me to print it. Ok.
That's only fair, Captain.
You know who headed that movement in London?
Mr. Stephen Fisher.
The man who ran the Universal Peace Party?
Why, that's preposterous.
The Mr. Fisher who was drowned a few hours ago.
He was using the peace party as a cover-up for spies and traitors.
He was going to be arrested as soon as we landed and sent back to London.
Those are facts.
I can't believe it.
He was a friend of mine.
The same Steven Fisher engineered the kidnapping of Van Meer, the Dutch diplomat.
Dont expect anybody to believe that.
It's the truth.
Dear Captain, wait a minute. This young lady should know whether my friend is speaking the truth about Mr.Fisher or not.
Yes, I ought to know. Mr. Fisher was...my father.
And I want the story printed.
What's that?
I guess that's my uncle.
Hello, Uncle.
How are you?
How's Aunt Sadie?
I'm all right, thanks. We had a little accident.
I can't tell you about it now.
I'll tell you later. I'll write to you.
I'm going back to Europe.
I was just wondering if you had any instructions for me. Yes.
Keep on the job.
Have you got all that down?
Rush it out at once.
This is London.
We have as a guest tonight one of the soldiers of the press... one of the little army of historians... who are writing history from beside the cannors mouth...
Foreign correspondent of the New York Globe... Huntley Haverstock.
Hello, America.
I've been watching a part of the world being blown to pieces.
A part of the world as nice as Vermont, Ohio...
Virginia, and California, and Illinois... lies ripped up and bleeding like a steer in a slaughterhouse.
I've seen things that make the history of savages read like Pollyanna legends.
We'll have to postpone the broadcast.
Let's go on as long as we can.
Madam, we have a shelter downstairs.
How about it, Carol?
They're listening in America, Johnny.
Okay. We'll tell them, then.
I can't read the rest of my speech because the lights went out... so I'll have to talk off the cuff.
All that noise you hear isn't static.
It's death coming to London.
Yes, they are coming here now. You can hear the bombs falling on the streets and the homes.
Don't tune me out.
Hang on a while. This is a big story. You're part of it.
It's too late to do anything here except stand in the dark, let them come.
It's as if the lights were out everywhere except in America.
Keep those lights burning.
Cover them with steel, ring them with guns... build a canopy of battleships and bombing planes around them.
Hello, America, hang onto your lights.
They're the only lights left in the world.
When'll you be back, Roy?
In a couple of weeks. Don't do nothing you wouldn't want me to hear about.
Well, so long.
So long.
How about a lift, mister?
Can't you see that sticker?
Sure, I see it.
But a good guy don't pay no attention to what some heel makes him stick on his truck.
Well, scrunch down on the running board till we get around the bend.
Going far?
No, just a couple of miles. I'd have walked her if my dogs wasn't pooped out.
Looking for a job? - No.
My old man's got a place. Forty acres.
He's a sharecropper, but we've been there a long while.
Been doing a job?
Yeah.
I seen your hands. You been swinging a pick or a sledge.
That's what makes them shiny. I notice little things like that all the time.
Got a trade?
Why don't you get at it, buddy?
You know.
You been going over me since I got in. Why don't you ask where I've been?
I don't stick my nose in nobody's business.
I stay in my own yard.
That big nose of yours been going over me like a sheep in a vegetable patch.
Well, I ain't keeping it a secret. I've been in the penitentiary. Been there four years.
Anything else? - You ain't gotta get sore.
Ask me anything.
I didn't mean nothing.
Me neither.
I'm just trying to get along without shoving anybody, that's all.
See that road ahead? That's where I get out.
You're about to bust a gut to know what I done, ain't you?
Well, I ain't a guy to let you down. Homicide.
He's my savior
My savior
My savior now
Howdy, friend.
Howdy.
Say ain't you young Tom Joad, old Tom's boy? Yeah.
I'm on my way home now.
Well, I do declare.
I baptized you, son.
Ain't you the preacher?
Used to be. Not no more.
I lost the call.
But, boy, I sure used to have it.
I used to get an irrigation ditch so full of repented sinners I'd pretty near drown half of them.
But not no more.
I lost the spirit.
I got nothing to preach about no more, that's all.
I ain't so sure of things.
I remember you preaching a sermon walking around on your hands, shouting your head off.
Yeah, I remember.
Went pretty good that way.
But that was nothing.
I preached a whole sermon once straddling the ridge pole of a barn.
Like this:
Did you see that one?
No.
You didn't?
Well, it's all gone anyway.
You should have got yourself a wife.
Why, at my meetings, I used to get the girls glory-shouting till they about passed out.
Then I'd go to comfort them. I'd always end up by loving them.
I'd feel bad and pray and pray, but it didn't do no good.
Next time, do it again. I figured I just wasn't worth saving.
Yeah, Pa always says you was never cut out for no preacher.
I never let one get by me if I could catch her. Have a snort?
But you wasn't a preacher.
A girl was just a girl to you.
To me, they's holy vessels.
I was saving their souls.
I asked myself, what is this here called Holy Spirit?
Maybe that's love.
Why, I love everybody so much I'm fit to burst sometimes.
So maybe there ain't no sin and there ain't no virtue.
It's just what people does.
Some things folks do is nice and some ain't so nice and that's all any man's got a right to say.
Of course, I'll say a grace if somebody sets out the food but my heart ain't in it.
Nice drinking liquor. - Ought to be.
That's factory liquor. Cost me a buck.
You been out traveling around?
Ain't you heard? It's been in the papers.
I've been in the penitentiary for four years.
Excuse me for asking.
I don't mind no more. I'd do what I done again.
Killed a guy in a dance hall.
We was drunk. He got a knife in me and I laid him out with a shovel.
Knocked his head plumb to squash.
You ain't ashamed? No.
He had a knife in me. That's why they only gave me seven years.
I got out in four. Parole.
Ain't seen your folks since?
No, but I aim to before sundown and I'm getting excited about it too.
Which way are you going?
It don't matter.
Ever since I lost the spirit, looks like I'd just as soon go one way as the other. I'll go your way.
Maybe Ma will have pork for supper.
I ain't had pork but four times in four years. Every Christmas.
I'll be glad to see your pa.
Last time I seen him was at a baptizing.
He had one of the biggest doses of the Holy Spirit I ever seen.
Got to jumping over bushes. Howling like a dog-wolf at moon-time.
Finally, he picks himself out a bush big as a piano and he lets out a squawk and takes a run at that bush.
Well, he cleared her. But he bust his leg snap in two doing it.
There was a traveling dentist and he set her and I gave her a praying over, but there wasn't no more Holy Spirit left in your pa after that.
Listen.
That wind's fixing to do something.
Sure it is. Always is this time of year.
Ma?
Pa?
Ma?
Ain't nobody here.
Something's happened.
You got a match?
They're all gone or dead.
They never wrote you nothing? - No.
They wasn't people to write.
It's Ma's. She had them for years.
Used to be mine. I gave it to Grandpa when I went away.
You reckon they're dead?
I never heard nothing about it.
Tommy?
Muley. - Where's my folks, Muley?
Why, they gone.
I know they're gone, but where are they gone?
It's Muley Graves. You remember the preacher, don't you?
I ain't no preacher anymore. - All right.
You remember the man?
Glad to see you again.
Now, where are my folks?
They gone.
They gone to your Uncle John's. The whole crowd of them. Two weeks ago.
But they can't stay there, because John's got his notice to get off. What happened?
How come they gotta get off?
We lived here 50 years, same place.
Everybody's gotta get off. Everybody's leaving. Going out to California.
Your folks, my folks, everybody's folks.
Everybody except me. I ain't getting off.
Who done it?
Listen. That's some of what done it. The dusters.
Blowing like this year after year.
Blowing the land away. Blowing the crops away. Blowing us away now.
Are you crazy?
Some say I am. You wanna hear how it happened?
That's what I'm asking you, ain't it?
Well, the way it happens... The way it happened to me...
A man come one day...
After what them dusters done to the land, the tenant system don't work no more.
They don't even break even, much less show profit.
One man and a tractor can handle 12 or 14 of these places.
You just pay him a wage and take all the crop.
Yeah, but we couldn't do on any less than what our share is now.
The children ain't getting enough to eat as it is.
And they're so ragged we'd be ashamed if everybody else's children wasn't the same way. I can't help that.
I got my orders. They told me to tell you to get off. - That's what I'm telling you.
You mean get off my own land? - Don't go to blaming me.
It ain't my fault. - Whose fault is it?
You know who owns the land.
Shawnee Land and Cattle Company.
Who's Shawnee Land and Cattle Company? - It ain't nobody.
It's a company.
They got a president, ain't they? They got somebody who knows what a shotgun's for!
Son, it ain't his fault because the bank tells him what to do. - All right.
Where's the bank? - Tulsa.
What's the use of picking on him? He ain't nothing but the manager.
He's half crazy trying to keep up with his orders.
Then who do we shoot?
Brother, I don't know.
If I did, I'd tell you. I just don't know who's to blame.
I'm right here to tell you, mister: There ain't nobody gonna push me off my land!
My grandpa took up this land 70 years ago!
My pa was born here. We was all born on it!
And some of us was killed on it!
And some of us died on it.
That's what makes it our'n.
Being born on it and working on it and dying.
And not no piece of paper with writing on it.
Well, what happened?
They come. They come and pushed me off.
They come with the cats. - The what?
The cats, the caterpillar tractors.
And for every one of them there was 10, 15 families thrown right out of their homes.
A hundred folks. And no place to live but on the road.
The Rances, the Peterses, the Perrys, the Joadses.
One right after the other, they got thrown out.
Half the folks you and me know thrown right out into the road.
The one that got me come, about a month ago.
Go on back! Go on back!
I'm warning you, go on back!
You come any closer and I'm gonna blow you right out of that cat!
I told you!
Why, you're Joe Davis' boy.
I don't like for nobody to draw a bead on me.
Then what are you doing this for? Against your own people.
Three dollars a day, that's what I'm doing it for.
I got two little kids at home. My wife, my wife's mother. Them folks gotta eat.
First and only, I think about my folks. What happens to others is their own lookout.
Yeah, but you don't understand, son. This is my land! Used to be your land.
It's the company's now.
Have it your own way, son.
But just as sure as you touch my house with that cat I'm gonna blow you plumb to kingdom come!
You ain't gonna blow nobody nowhere. First place, they'd hang you and you know it.
It wouldn't be two days before they'd send a guy to take my place. Now go on!
Get out of the way!
What was the use? He was right. And there wasn't a thing in the world I could do about it.
It's just, it don't seem possible just getting throwed off like that.
The rest of my family set out for the West. There wasn't nothing to eat, but I couldn't leave.
Something just wouldn't let me.
So now I just wander around and sleep wherever I am.
I used to tell myself that I was looking out for things so that when the folks come back, everything would be all right.
But I knowed it wasn't true.
There ain't nothing to look out for and there ain't nobody ever coming back.
They're gone!
And me I'm just an old graveyard ghost.
That's all in the world I am.
Do you think I'm touched?
No.
You're lonely, but you ain't touched.
Well, it don't matter. If I'm touched, I'm touched and that's all there is to it.
The thing I don't understand is my folks taking it.
Like Ma. I seen her nearly beat a peddler to death with a live chicken.
She aimed to go with an ax in the other hand got mixed up, forgot which was which.
When she got through with that peddler, all she had left was two chicken legs.
Just a... Just a plain old graveyard ghost. That's all.
She's settling.
What do you figure on doing?
It's hard to say. Stay here till morning, go to Uncle John's, I reckon.
After that, I don't know.
Listen.
That's them. Them lights.
Come on. Come on. We gotta hide out.
Hide out for what? We ain't doing nothing.
You're trespassing. This ain't your land no more. That's the superintendent with a gun.
Come on!
Come on, Tom. You're on parole.
Muley!
All you gotta do is hide and watch.
Won't they come out here?
I don't think so.
One came out once and I clipped him...
Shh! From behind with a fence stake. They ain't bothered since.
He ain't here.
Anybody ever told me I'd be hiding out at my own place...
Lord, make us grateful for what we are about to receive for his sake. Amen.
I seen you. You ate during grace. Just one little dab.
Just one teeny little old dab, that's all.
Ain't he messy though. - I seen him.
Gobbling away like an old pig.
Why don't you keep your eyes shut during grace, you old...?
What's it say again, Uncle John?
It says, "Plenty of work in California.
Eight hundred pickers wanted."
Wait till I get to California.
I'm gonna reach up and pick me an orange whenever I want it. Or some grapes.
Now, there's something I ain't never had enough of.
I'm gonna get me a whole big bunch of grapes off a bush and I'm gonna squash them all over my face and let the juice drain down off of my chin.
Praise the Lord for victory!
I sure would like that.
Yes, sir, I sure would like that.
Oh, thank God. Thank God.
Tommy.
Ma.
You didn't bust out, did you?
You ain't gotta hide?
No, Ma. I'm paroled. I got my papers.
I was so scared we was going away without you and we'd never see each other again.
I'd have found you, Ma.
Muley told me what happened. We going to California true?
We've gotta go, Tommy, but it's gonna be all right.
I seen the handbills about how much work there is, and high wages too.
There's something I gotta find out first, Tommy.
Did they hurt you, son? Did they hurt you and make you mean mad?
Mad, Ma?
Sometimes they do. - No, Ma.
I was at first, but not no more.
Sometimes they do something to you.
They hurt you and you get mad and then you get mean.
And they hurt you again and you get meaner and meaner till you ain't no boy nor man anymore, just a walking chunk of mean mad.
Did they hurt you that way, son?
No, Ma. Don't worry about that.
I don't want no mean son. - It's Tommy.
It's Tommy back! - Tommy!
What'd you do, son?
Tommy's out of jail!
I knowed it! You couldn't keep him in. You can't keep a Joad in jail.
I knowed it from the first.
Get out of my way! I told you so.
I told you Tom would come busting out of that jail just like a bull through a corral fence.
You can't keep a Joad in jail! - I didn't bust out.
They paroled me.
I was that way myself.
How are you, Uncle John?
Hello, Tommy. I'm feeling fine.
How are you, Noah?
Fine, Tommy. Bust out?
No, parole.
Hello. - Tommy!
The jailbird's back! The jailbird's back!
Hi, Al.
Hello, Tom.
Did you bust out of jail?
No, they paroled me.
Rosasharn.
Busted out.
That's Connie Rivers with her. They're married now.
She's due now about three, four months.
She wasn't any more than a kid when I went up.
Hi, Rosasharn.
How are you, Tom?
This is Connie, my husband.
Did you...?
No, parole.
If this don't beat all. I see I'm gonna be an uncle soon.
You do not see.
Hey, Joad! John Joad.
You ain't forgot, have you? - We ain't forgot.
We'll be coming through here tomorrow.
I know. We be out. We be out by sunup.
How'd you get all this money?
Sold things, chopped cotton. Even Grandpa.
Got us about $200 all told.
Shucked out 75 for this here truck.
Still got nearly 150 to set out on. I figure we ought to be able to make her on that. Easy.
After all, they ain't but about 12 of us, is they?
She'll probably ride like a bull calf, but she'll ride.
Well, I reckon we better begin rousting them out if we aim to get out by daylight.
How about it, John? How are you boys coming?
Ma.
I'm ready.
Rosasharn, honey. Wake up the children. We're fixing to leave.
Ruthie. Winfield. Jump up now.
Where's Grandpa? Al, go get him.
I'm gonna get up front. Somebody help me. Wait.
Somebody help me.
Kids, you climb up on top first.
We're going to California!
Al's gonna drive, Ma. Sit with him and Grandma, and we'll swap around later.
Connie, help Rosasharn up there alongside the kids.
Where's Grandpa?
Grandpa!
Where he always is, probably.
Grandpa! Grandpa! Well, save him a place.
John, you and Noah climb up and find a place.
Gotta kind of keep her even all around.
You think it'll hold?
If it does, it'll be a miracle out of Scripture.
Ma. Pa.
Let go of me, goldurn you!
No, Pa, please.
What's the matter, Grandpa?
What's the matter? There's nothing the matter.
I just... - I just ain't going, that's all.
What do you mean? We gotta go.
We got no place to stay.
I ain't talking about you, I'm talking about me.
I give her a good going-over all last night and I'm staying.
But you can't do that, Grandpa. This here land's going under the tractor.
We all gotta get out.
All except me and I'm staying. - What about Grandma?
Take her with you!
Who'd cook for you, Grandpa? How you gonna live?
Muley's living, ain't he? And I'm twice the man that Muley is.
Now, listen to me, Grandpa. Listen to me just a minute.
And I ain't listening either.
I told you what I was gonna do, and I don't give a hoot and a holler if there's oranges and grapes crowding a fella out of bed.
I ain't going to California!
Goldurn!
This is my country and I belong here.
It's my dirt.
It's no good, but it's... It's mine, all mine.
Either we gotta tie him up and throw him in the truck or something. He can't stay here. No, can't tie him.
Either we'll hurt him or he'll get so mad, he'll hurt himself.
Reckon we could get him drunk?
Ain't no whiskey, is there?
Now, wait. There's a half a bottle of soothing syrup here.
Here. Used to put the children to sleep.
Don't taste bad.
There's coffee left. We can fix him a cup.
That's right, douse some in it.
Better give him a good dose. He's mighty muleheaded.
If Muley... If Muley can scramble along, I... I guess I can.
I smell spareribs.
Somebody's been eating spareribs.
How come I ain't got none?
Well, I got some saved for you, Grandpa. Got some warming now.
And here's a cup of coffee for you first.
Get me a mess of spareribs. I want a great big mess of spareribs.
I'm... I'm hungry.
Why, sure you're hungry.
I sure do like spareribs.
Get up there, Noah.
Easy, now. Easy!
Better throw something over him so he won't get sunstruck.
Everything all set now?
All right, let her go, Al.
Get aboard, Ma.
Well, goodbye and good luck.
Hold her, Al.
Ain't you going with us?
I'd like to.
There's something going on there in the West and I'd like to try and learn what it is if you feel you've got the room.
Plenty of room. Get on.
Let her go, Al!
California, here we come!
Ain't you gonna look back, Ma? Give the old place a last look?
We're going to California, ain't we?
All right then, let's go to California.
That don't sound like you, Ma. You never was like that before.
I never had my house pushed over before.
Never had my family stuck out on the road.
Never had to lose everything I had in life.
I ain't going. - It's gonna be all right, Grandpa.
I ain't going.
It's all right, Grandpa. You're just tired, that's all.
That's it. Just tired.
Just tired.
This here is William James Joad. Died of a stroke, old, old man.
His folks buried him because they got no money to pay for funerals.
Nobody killed him. Just a stroke and he died."
I figure best we leave something like this on him lest somebody digs him up and makes out he was killed.
Looks like a lot of times the government's got more interest in a dead man than a live one.
Not be so lonesome, knowing his name's there with him.
Not just an old fella lonesome underground.
Would you say a few words, Casy?
I ain't a preacher no more, you know.
We know, but ain't none of our folks ever been buried without a few words.
I'll say them, make it short.
This here old man just lived a life and just died out of it.
I don't know whether he was good or bad and it don't matter much.
Heard a fella say a poem once.
And he says, "All that lives is holy."
Well, I wouldn't pray just for an old man that's dead because he's all right.
If I was to pray, I'd pray for folks that's alive and don't know which way to turn.
Grandpa here he ain't got no more trouble like that.
He's got his job all cut out for him so cover him up and let him get to it.
I'm going down the road feeling bad
I'm going down the road feeling bad
Oh Lordy
I ain't a-gonna be a-treated this way
They fed me on corn bread and beans
Gosh, Connie sure sings pretty, don't he?
I ain't a-gonna be a-treated this way
That's my son-in-law.
Sings real nice.
What state you all from? Oklahoma.
Had us a farm there, sharecropping.
We're from Arkansas. Had me a store there. Kind of a general notions store.
When the farms went, the stores went too.
I had as nice a little store as you ever saw. I sure did hate to give it up.
Well, you can't tell.
I figure when we get out there and get work and maybe get us a piece of growing land near water, it might not be so bad at that.
That's right. Paying good wages, I hear.
We can all get work.
Can't be no worse than home.
You all must have a pot of money.
No, we ain't got no money but there's plenty of us to work and we're all good men.
Get good wages out there and put it all together, and we'll be all right.
Good wages?
Picking oranges and peaches?
Well, we aim to take whatever they got. - What's so funny about that?
What's so funny about it?
I've just been out there.
I've been and seen it.
I'm going back and starve because I'd rather starve all over at once.
Say, what do you think you're talking about?
I got a handbill here says they're paying good wages.
And I seen in the papers they need pickers.
All right, go on. Nobody's stopping you.
Yeah, but what about this?
I ain't gonna rile you. Go on.
Wait a minute, buddy. You just done some jackassing.
You can't shut up now.
It says they need 800 pickers. You laugh and say they don't.
Which one's the liar?
How many of you got them handbills? - I got one.
Come on, how many?
I got one.
We all got one.
What does that prove? - There you are. Same yellow handbill.
Eight hundred pickers wanted.
All right, the man wants 800 men.
So he prints 5,000 handbills and maybe 20,000 people see them.
And maybe 2- or 3,000 people start west on account of that handbill.
Two or 3,000 people that are crazy with worry heading out for 800 jobs.
Now, does that make sense?
Say, what are you, a troublemaker?
You sure you ain't one of them labor fakes? I...
I swear I ain't, mister.
Don't you go around here trying to stir up any trouble.
I tried to tell you folks what it took me a year to find out.
Took two kids dead. Took my wife dead to show me.
But nobody could tell me neither.
I can't tell you about them little fellas laying in the tent with their bellies swelled out and just skin over their bones.
Shivering and whining like pups.
And me running around looking for work.
Not for money, not for wages.
Just for a cup of flour and a spoon of lard.
Then the coroner come.
Them children died of heart failure," he said. He put it down in his paper.
Heart failure?
And their little bellies stuck out like a pig bladder.
Well, it's late. I gotta get some sleep.
Well... Good night, folks.
Suppose he's telling the truth, that fella?
He's telling the truth. The truth for him.
He wasn't making it up.
Was it the truth for us?
I don't know.
I gotta get out, I tell you.
I gotta get out now.
You folks aim to buy anything?
We want some gas, mister.
Got any money?
What do you think, we're begging?
I just asked, that's all.
Well, ask right. You ain't talking to bums.
All in the world I done was ask.
What kind of pie you got?
Banana, pineapple, chocolate and apple.
Cut me a hunk of that banana cream and a cup of java.
Make it two.
Two it is. Seen any good etchings lately, Bill?
Well, this one ain't bad. A little kid comes late for school and the teacher says...
Cheese it.
Could you see your way clear to sell us a loaf of bread, ma'am?
This ain't a grocery store. We got bread to make sandwiches with.
I know, ma'am. Only, it's for an old lady. No teeth.
Got to soften it with water so she can chew it, and she's hungry.
Why don't you buy a sandwich? We got nice sandwiches.
Well, I sure would like to do that, ma'am, but the fact is, we ain't got but a dime for it.
It's all figured out, I mean for the trip.
You can't buy no loaf of bread for a dime. We only got 15-cent loaves.
Give him the bread.
We'll run out before the bread truck comes.
All right, then we run out!
This here's a 15-cent loaf.
Well, would you...? Could you see your way to cutting off 10 cents worth?
Give him the loaf.
No, sir. We wanna buy 10 cents worth.
Go on, it's yesterday's bread.
Go ahead. Bert says to take it.
Well, it may sound funny, being so tight, but we got 1,000 miles to go and we don't know if we'll make it.
Is them penny candies, ma'am?
Which ones?
There, them stripy ones.
Oh, them.
Well, no. - Them's two for a penny.
Give us two then, ma'am.
Go on, take them, take them.
Thank you, ma'am.
Them ain't two-for-a-cent candy.
What's it to you?
Them's a-nickel-apiece candy.
We better get going. We're dropping time.
So long.
Wait a minute, you got change coming.
What's it to you?
Bert.
Look.
Truck drivers.
Where you going?
California.
How long you plan to be in Arizona?
No longer than to get across.
Got any plants?
No, no plants.
Okay, go ahead, but keep moving.
Well, there she is, folks. The land of milk and honey.
California.
Well, if that's what we came out here for...
Well, Connie, maybe it's nice on the other side. Them picture postcards, they was real pretty.
There, Grandma. There's California.
Let's get going. She don't look so tough to me, John?
Well, I don't know.
Hold on.
Ain't too cold, is she, Tom?
No, it's fine when you get in, Pa.
Come on, John. Let's give her a whirl.
This is supposed to be good for you, John.
Come on, Pa, before she floats away.
You people got a lot of nerve.
What do you mean?
Crossing the desert in a jalopy like this.
You been across?
Sure, plenty. But never in no wreck like that.
If we break down, maybe somebody'd give us a hand.
Well, maybe, but I'd hate to be doing it. Takes more nerve than I got.
Don't take no nerve to do something, ain't nothing else you can do.
Hope she holds.
Grandpa.
I want Grandpa.
I want Grandpa.
Don't you fret now.
There. Don't you fret now, Grandma.
Everybody set back there?
Yeah.
Here we go.
Thank you very much.
Holy Moses, what a hard-looking outfit.
All them Okies is hard-looking.
Boy, but I'd hate to hit that desert in a jalopy like that.
You and me got sense. Them Okies got no sense and no feeling.
They ain't human. No human being would live the way they do.
A human being couldn't stand to be so miserable.
Just don't know any better, I guess.
What a place. How would you like to walk across it?
People done it. If they could, we could.
Lots must have died too.
Well, we ain't out of it yet.
This here's the desert. We're right in it.
I wish it was day.
Tom says if it was day, it'd cut the gizzard right out of you.
I seen a picture once and there was bones everywhere.
Man bones?
Some, I guess. But mostly cow bones.
I sure would like to see some of them man bones.
Grandpa. I want Grandpa. Yes.
Now, everything's going to be all right.
We got to get across, Grandma.
The family's got to get across.
Seems like we wasn't ever doing nothing but moving. I'm tired.
Women's always tired.
You ain't? You ain't sorry, are you, honey?
No, but...
But you seen that advertisement in the Spicy Western Story magazine.
Don't pay nothing. Just send them the coupon and you're a radio expert.
Nice, clean work.
But we can still do it, honey.
I ought to have done it then, not come on any trip like this.
What's this here?
Agricultural inspection. We gotta go over your stuff. Got any vegetables or seed?
No.
We gotta look over your stuff. You gotta unload.
Unload?
Holy Moses.
You'll have to get out while we unload for inspection.
Look, mister, we've got a sick old lady. We gotta get her to a doctor. We can't wait.
You can't make us wait. Yeah?
Well, we gotta look you over.
Well, I swear we ain't got anything. I swear it. Grandma's awful sick.
You wasn't fooling.
You swear you got no fruit or vegetables?
No, I swear it.
Then go ahead. Get a doctor at Barstow. That's just eight miles.
But don't stop or get off. Understand? - Thank you.
Okay, cap.
Much obliged.
Ma! Grandma! Look!
There she is. There she is. I never knowed there was anything like her.
Will you look at her?
Look yonder, John.
Look how pretty and green it is, Winfield.
Wonder if them's orange trees, John. - Look like orange trees to me.
They sure are pretty, whatever they are.
Yes, indeed.
Look at them haystacks. I bet we sure could have fun playing over there.
Pretty, ain't it? Mighty pretty. Tom.
Where's Ma?
I want Ma to see this. Look, Ma.
Come here, Ma.
You sick, Ma?
You say we got across?
Look.
Thank God.
And we're still together.
Didn't you sleep none?
Was Grandma bad?
Grandma's dead.
When?
Since before they stopped us last night.
That's why you didn't want them to look?
I was afraid they'd stop us and we wouldn't get across.
I told Grandma.
I told her when she was dying. I told her the family had to get across.
I told her we couldn't take no chance on being stopped.
So it's all right.
She'll get buried where it's nice and green and trees and flowers all around and...
She got to lay her head down in California after all.
How far you figure you gonna get that way, pushing?
Right here. We run out of gas.
Where's the best place to get work around here?
Don't matter what kind either.
If I've seen one of them things, I've seen 10,000 of them.
Ain't it no good? - Not here.
Not now.
There was some picking around here about a month ago, but it's all moved south.
What part of Oklahoma you from, anyhow? - Sallisaw.
Sallisaw?
Well, I come out from Cherokee County myself about two years ago.
Cherokee County! Gee!
Oh, boy!
Connie's folks are from Cherokee County.
Well, you don't say!
All right, all right. Let's don't go into it.
What I gotta tell you is this: Don't try to park in town tonight.
Just go right on out to that camp.
If I catch you in town after dark, I gotta lock you up.
But what are we gonna do?
Well, Pop, that just ain't up to me.
The guy they ought to lock up is the guy that sent them things out.
How many, folks?
Sure don't look none too prosperous. - Wanna go somewhere else?
On a gallon of gas?
Let's set up the tent and maybe I can fix some stew.
I could break up some brush if you want me, ma'am.
You wanna be asked to eat, don't you?
Yes, ma'am.
Didn't you have no breakfast? - No, ma'am.
There ain't no work hereabouts.
Pa's been trying to sell some stuff to get gas, so as we can get along.
Didn't none of these have no breakfast?
I did. Me and my brother did.
We ate good.
Well, you ain't hungry then, are you?
We ate good.
I'm glad some of you ain't hungry. There won't be enough to go all around.
He was bragging. Know what he done?
Last night, come out and say they got chicken to eat.
Well, I looked in whilst they was eating and it was fried dough, just like everybody else.
Ma? How about it?
Well, I don't know what to do.
I've got to feed the family. And what am I gonna do about all these here?
Give this to Ruthie.
Here.
There you are, John.
Here, Tom. You take it. I ain't hungry.
What do you mean? You ain't ate today.
I know, but I got a stomachache. I ain't hungry.
Take that plate in the tent and you eat it.
It wouldn't be no use. I'd still see them.
You get. Go on now. Get.
You ain't doing no good. There ain't enough for youse anyway.
Go on now.
You can't send them away.
Here. Take your plates and go inside.
Now, look, all you little fellas. You each go and get you a nice flat stick and I'll put what's left for you?
Now get.
I don't know whether I'm doing right or not.
Get inside. Get inside, everybody, and stay inside.
Lady's gonna feed us. Get yourself a tin can.
You men wanna work?
Sure, we wanna work. Where's it at?
Tovaris County. Fruit's opening up. Need a lot of fruit pickers.
You doing the hiring?
Well, I'm contracting the land.
What you paying?
Well, can't tell exactly yet. About, 30 cents, I guess.
Why can't you tell? You took the contract, didn't you?
That's true, but it's keyed to the price.
Might be a little more, might be a little less.
All right, mister. I'll go.
You just show us your license to contract, then you make out an order.
Where, and when and how much you're gonna pay. You sign it and we'll go.
Now, listen, smart guy. I'll run my business my own way.
I got work. If you wanna take it, okay.
If not, just sit here, that's all.
Twice now I fell for that line.
Maybe he needs 1,000 men.
So he gets 5,000 there and he'll pay 15 cents an hour.
You guys will have to take it because you'll be hungry.
If he wants to hire men, let him write it out and say what he's gonna pay.
Ask to see his license. He ain't allowed to contract men without a license.
Hey, Joe. Agitator.
Ever see this guy before?
Seems like I have.
Seems like I seen him hanging around a used-car lot that was busted into.
Yep, that's the fella. Get in this car.
You got nothing on him.
Open your trap again and you'll go too.
You don't wanna listen to troublemakers. You better all pack and come to Tovaris County.
Come on, you.
Give me that gun.
Go down to the willows and wait.
I ain't gonna run.
Why, the sheriff, he seen you, Tom.
You wanna get fingerprinted?
I guess you're right.
Hide in the willows. If it's all right to come back I'll give you four high whistles.
What's going on here?
This man of yours he got tough so I hit him.
Then he started shooting. Hit that woman there, so I hit him again.
Well, what'd you do in the first place?
I talked back.
Is this the fella that hit you?
Don't look like him.
It was me, all right. You just got smart with the wrong fella.
Get in that car.
This lady's bleeding to death.
Boy, what a mess them.45s make. Better get the doc.
Al.
You can come in now.
We gotta get out of here.
Guy in the willows said them poolroom fellas figure on burning the camp out.
We gotta get the truck loaded.
Ma. Pa.
What are you doing with the jack handle?
Well, we'll fight it out later. We gotta hustle. Where's Connie?
Well, Tom, he's gone.
He lit out this evening.
Said he didn't know it was going to be like this.
Glad to get shot of him. - Never was no good, never will be.
Pa, shh!
How come I got to shh? Run out on us, didn't he?
Cut it out, Pa. Help Al with the truck. Some of the fellas in town, they're gonna burn out the camp tonight.
Don't fret, honey. You'll be all right.
Tom, I just don't feel like nothing at all.
Without him, I just don't wanna live.
He'll be back. We'll leave word for him.
Just don't you worry.
Get on. Ma, you and Rosasharn climb up.
Ma. Maybe... Maybe Connie gone to get some books to study up with.
He gonna be a radio expert, you know. Maybe he figured to surprise us.
Maybe that's just what he done.
Ma, there comes a time when a man gets mad.
You promised me...
I know, Ma. I'm trying to.
If there was a law, maybe we could take it. But it ain't the law.
They're working on our spirits trying to make us cringe and crawl, working on our decency.
You promised, Tom. - I know.
I'm trying to, Ma. Honest I am.
You gotta keep clear. The family's breaking up. You gotta keep clear.
What's that? A detour?
Tom! Tom! Please!
Just where do you think you're going?
We're strangers here, mister. We heard there was work in a place called Tovaris. Yeah?
You're heading the wrong way.
What's more, we don't want no more Okies in this town.
There ain't enough work here for them that's already here.
Which way's it at, mister?
You turn right around and head north. And don't you come back until the cotton's ready.
You understand?
Pa. Let's try that other tire.
You got another flat tire, Tom?
Pa, get that spare back there?
Ma, will you get the hell off there?
Tell you, something's got to happen soon.
We're down to our last day of grease and two days of flour and 10 potatoes.
And Rosasharn, we gotta remember she's gonna be due soon.
Morning.
Morning.
You folks looking for work?
We're looking under boards for work.
Can you pick peaches?
We can pick anything.
There's plenty of work about 40 miles up here, this side of Pixley.
You turn east on 32, look for the Keene ranch.
Tell them Spencer sent you.
Mister, we sure thank you.
Come on, Ma.
What is it? A wreck?
Where do you think you're going?
A fella named Spencer sent us. Said there was work picking peaches.
You wanna work?
Sure do.
All right. Just pull up in line there.
Okay for this one. Take them through. - What's the matter?
What happened?
A little trouble up there, but you'll get through all right.
Go ahead.
What do you think it is?
A washout?
I don't know what these cops have got to do with it, but I don't like it.
These are our own people too, all of them.
I don't like this.
Get going. Stay in line.
Go ahead.
What are you gonna do, scab?
Go on. Hurry up.
Come on, come on, come on.
Go on up there.
Up the street there.
Keep in line, up the street.
Hold it, bud.
Wanna work?
Sure, but what is this?
None of your business.
Name? - Joad.
How many men?
Four.
Women?
Two.
Kids?
Two.
Can you all work?
Sure, I guess so.
Okay. House 63. Wages, 5 cents a box.
No bruised fruit.
Move along. You go to work right away.
Come on, honey.
Name?
Joad. Say, what is all this here?
Joad. Not here.
License?
Oklahoma E-L-2-0-4.
Don't check. Now, you look here. We don't want no trouble with you.
Sure do wanna make you feel at home here, all right.
We gonna live here, Ma?
Why, sure. This won't be so bad once we get her washed out.
I liked the tent better.
Why, this has got a floor.
It won't leak when it rains.
Here. This might come in handy.
Name?
Still Joad.
How many?
Six. You all go on. Rosasharn and me will unload the truck.
Any more of them hamburgers, Ma?
No, there ain't. - You made a dollar. That's a dollar's worth.
Dollar's worth?
They charge extra at that company store and there ain't no other place.
Well, I ain't full.
Well, tomorrow you'll get in a full day's work and a full day's pay, and then we'll all have enough.
You wouldn't think just reaching up and picking would get you in the back.
Think I'll walk out and find out what all that fuss outside the gate was.
Anybody come with me?
No, I think I'll set a while, then go to bed.
Think I'll look around and see if I can't meet me a girl.
Say, when I was your age...
Working on me what all that yelling was about. Got me all curious.
I'll be back in a little while.
Tom. Now, you be careful. Don't you go sticking your nose in anything.
Okay, Ma. Don't worry.
Where do you think you're going?
I thought I'd take a walk. - Is there any law against that?
You can just turn around and walk back.
You mean I can't even get out of here?
Not tonight, you can't.
Do you wanna walk back? Or shall I whistle up some help and have you taken back?
I'll walk back.
Evening.
Who are you?
Just going past, that's all.
Know anybody around here? No.
Just going past, I tell you.
Casy!
Well, if it ain't Tom Joad. Hi, boy.
I thought you was in jail.
No. They just run me out of town. Come on in.
Tom Joad.
This the fella you been talking about?
That's him.
What are you doing here?
Working, picking peaches.
I heard fellas shouting when we come in. I came to find out what's going on. - What's it all about?
This here's a strike.
Well, 5 cents a box ain't much, but a fella can eat.
Five cents?
They paying you 5 cents? - Sure.
We made a buck since midday.
Lookie, Tom. We come here to work.
They tell us it's gonna be 5 cents, but there's a whole lot of us.
So the man says 2 and a half cents.
A fella can't even eat on that and if he's got kids...
So we says we won't take it. So they drive us off.
Now they're paying you 5 cents. But if they bust this strike, you think they'll pay 5?
Don't know. Paying 5 now.
They'll get 2 and a half cents just the minute we're gone.
You know what that is.
One ton of peaches, picked and carried for a dollar.
That way you can't even buy enough food to keep you alive.
Tell them to come out with us, Tom. Them peaches is ripe.
Two days out and they'll pay us all 5, maybe 7.
They won't. They're getting 5 now. That's all they care about.
But the moment they ain't strikebreaking, they won't get no 5.
Next thing you know you'll be out. They got it all fixed down to a tee.
Well, soon as the harvest is in, you're a migrant worker. Afterwards, just a bum.
Five they're getting now. That's all they're interested in.
I know exactly what Pa would say. He'd say it's none of his business.
That's right. He'll have to take a beating before he'll know.
Take a beating? We was out of food.
Tonight we had meat. Not much, but we had it.
You think Pa's gonna give up his meat on account of some other fellas?
Rosasharn needs milk.
You think Ma's gonna starve that baby just on account of fellas yelling outside a gate?
Tom, you gotta learn like I'm learning.
I don't know what's right yet myself, but I'm trying to find out.
That's why I can't ever be a preacher again.
Preacher's gotta know. I don't know.
I gotta ask.
I don't like it. - What's the matter?
I can't tell. Seems as though I hear something and when I listen, there ain't nothing to hear.
It ain't out of the question, you know.
We're all a little itchy. Cops been telling us how they're gonna beat us up and run us out.
Not them regular deputies, but them tin-seal men. The ones they got for guards.
They figure I'm the leader because I talk so much.
Turn out the light. Come outside.
What is it?
I don't know.
Can't tell whether you hear it or not. - You hear it, Tom?
I hear it. I think there's some guys coming this way, a lot of them. - We gotta get out of here.
Down that way, under the bridge span.
There he is! The one in the middle, the skinny one. Chuck, Alec, get him!
You don't know what you're doing! You're helping to starve kids.
Shut up, you dirty...
Casy!
You've killed him!
Serves him right too.
Look out!
He's dead. He's good and dead. Did you see the fella that done it?
I ain't sure, but I caught him across the face, a trademark he won't get rid of in a hurry.
Ma?
Tom! Tom! Pa, wake up.
Al, get the light.
Come on.
Anybody ask anything?
No, ma'am.
Well, you stay by that door.
Yes, ma'am.
Tommy?
How's it feel?
Busted my cheek, but I can still see.
What'd you hear?
Looks like you've done it.
I thought so. Felt like it.
Folks ain't talking about much else.
They say they got posses out. Talking about a lynching when they catch the fella.
They killed Casy first.
That ain't the way they're telling it. They're saying you done it first.
Do they know what the fella looks like?
They know he got hit in the face.
I'm sorry, Ma.
I didn't know what I was doing any more than when you take a breath. I didn't even know I was gonna do it.
It's all right, Tommy.
I wished you didn't do it but you done what you had to do and I can't read no fault in you.
I'm going away tonight. I can't go putting this on you folks.
Tom. There's a whole lot I don't understand. But going away ain't gonna ease us.
There was a time we was on the land. There was a boundary to us then.
Old folks died off and little fellas come.
We was always one thing.
We was the family.
Kind of whole and clear.
But now we ain't clear no more.
There ain't nothing that keeps us clear.
Al, he's hankering and gibbeting to be off on his own. Uncle John's just dragging around.
Your pa's lost his place. He ain't the head no more.
We're cracking up, Tom.
There ain't no family now.
And Rosasharn, she's gonna have her baby, but it won't have no family.
I been trying to keep her going, but...
And Winfield what's he gonna be this way?
Growing up wild. And Ruthie too.
Just like animals.
Got nothing to trust.
Don't go, Tom.
Stay and help. Help me.
Okay, Ma. I shouldn't. I know I shouldn't, but okay.
Ma, here come a lot of people.
How many?
Ten of us.
House 25. The number's on the door.
Okay, mister. What you paying?
Two and a half cents.
Two and a half?
Say, mister, a man can't make his dinner on that.
Take it or leave it. There are 200 men coming in from the South that'll be glad to get it.
But how are we going to eat?
Look.
I didn't set the price. If you want it, okay. If you don't, turn around and beat it.
Which way to House 25?
Straight up the street.
That Casy.
He might have been a preacher, but he seen things clear.
He was like a lantern. He helped me to see things too.
Comes night, we'll get out of here.
Like a lantern.
I'll start the car.
All right, Tom.
Jump up.
Just till we get distance. Then you can come out.
I'd hate to get trapped in here.
Get in, Ma.
Come on, John.
Hey! Where you going?
We're going out.
What for?
We got a job offered. A good job.
Yeah? - Yeah.
Well, let's take a look at you.
Wasn't there another fella with you?
You mean that hitchhiker?
Little short fella with a pale face?
I guess that's what he looked like.
We just picked him up on the way in. - He left when the rate dropped.
What did you say he looked like again?
Short fella, pale face.
Was he bruised about the face this morning?
I didn't see nothing.
Okay, go on.
Going out for good?
Yeah. Going north.
Okay.
You done good, Al. You done real good.
Know where we're going?
It don't matter. We gotta go and keep going till we get plenty of distance away from here.
She's... She's hotter than a heifer.
The fan belt's shot.
Sure picked a nice place for it too, didn't she? - Got any gas?
About half a gallon.
Well, Ma, sure looks like we done her this time.
Lights up ahead. That might be a camp or something.
Looks like about a mile. Reckon she'll coast her, Al?
Got to coast it.
Well, let's give her a whirl? Come on, kids.
Get in. John!
Did you hurt yourself, John?
You hit it too fast.
What's the idea of that?
Well, you see, a lot of children play in here.
You can tell people to drive slow and they're liable to forget but once they hit that hump, they don't forget.
Got any room here for us?
You're lucky. How do you do, ma'am?
How are you?
Down that line, turn to the left. You'll see it.
You'll be in Number 4 sanitary unit.
What's that?
Toilet, showers, washtubs.
You mean we'll have washtubs with running water?
Yes, ma'am. Ha. Camp committee will call on you in the morning, get you fixed.
Cops?
No. No cops. No, people here elect their own cops.
The ladies' committee'll call on you, ma'am.
Tell you about the children, the schools and sanitary unit and who takes care of them.
Will you come inside and sign up?
Drive her on down, Al. I'll sign up.
Right this way.
Now, I don't wanna seem inquisitive, you understand but there's certain information I have to have.
What's your name?
Joad. Tom Joad.
J-O...
A-D.
And how many of you?
Eight now.
Uncle John, you don't look so good.
I ain't so good, but I'm coming.
Come on.
Shove.
Campsite costs a dollar a week.
You can work that out carrying garbage, keeping the camp clean, things like that.
We'll work it out.
What's the committee you're talking about?
We have five sanitary units. Each one elects a central committee man.
They make the laws and what they say goes.
You aiming to tell me the fellas running the camp are just fellas camping here?
That's the way it is.
And you say no cops?
No cop can come in here without a warrant.
I can't hardly believe it.
Camp I was in before, they burnt it out. Deputies and some of them poolroom fellas.
They don't get in here.
Sometimes the boys patrol the fences. - Especially on dance nights.
You got dances too?
We have the best dances in the county, every Saturday night.
Who runs this place?
The government.
Why ain't there more like it?
You find out. I can't.
Is there anything like work around here?
I can't promise you that but there'll be a licensed agent here later if you wanna talk to him.
That cut you have?
Crate fell on me.
You'd better take care of it. Store manager will give you something for it.
See you later.
Ma's sure gonna like it here. She ain't been treated decent for a long while.
See you later.
Winfield. I got something to show you.
What's the matter?
It's some white things made out of dish stuff, like in the catalogs.
Come on, I'll show you.
Come on. Ain't nobody gonna say anything.
There's where you wash your hands.
I reckon you stand in them little rooms. And water comes down out of that little jigger up there.
You take a bath. - Look.
Just like in the catalogs. - Hey!
Don't you go monkeying!
Now you done it! You busted it!
All I done was pull that string.
Hi, Mr. Thomas.
Morning.
How are you?
Morning. Nice job.
Listen here.
Maybe I'm gonna talk myself out of my farm, but I like you fellas.
You're good workers so I'm gonna tell you. - You live over in the government camp?
Yes, sir.
You have dances there every Saturday night.
We sure do.
Well, look out next Saturday night.
What's the matter?
I'm head to the central committee. I gotta know.
Well, don't tell I told you.
Listen.
Citizens angered at red agitators burning other squatters' camps and order agitators to leave the county."
Listen. What is these reds anyway?
Every time you turn around, somebody's calling somebody else a red.
What is these reds anyway?
I ain't talking about that, one way or the other.
All I'm saying is there's going to be a fight at the camp Saturday night and there'll be deputies ready to go in.
Now go on with your work.
Maybe I've talked myself into trouble, but you're folks like us and I like you.
We won't tell who told. Thank you.
All right.
There ain't gonna be no fight either.
Evening. Who'd you say invited you?
Mr. And Mrs. Brown.
Go right on in, folks. Go right on in. Hello, there.
Hi, Mrs. Jennings. How are you? Glad to see you.
Hello.
Hello.
Going to the dance tonight?
I can waltz.
That's nothing. Anybody can waltz.
Not like me, they can't.
You get going! This girl's spoke for. She's gonna be married and her man's coming for her.
Hi, Bill. Nice-looking girl you got there.
Howdy, Mr. Thomas. Howdy, Mrs. Thomas.
Watching out, ain't you?
There ain't gonna be no trouble.
I hope you know what you're talking about.
Evening, boys. Who did you say invited you?
Fella named Jackson.
Okay. Have a good time.
Thanks.
Hey. - Them's our fellas.
How do you know?
Well just got a feeling. They're kind of scared too.
Follow them. Get hold of Jackson, see if he knows them.
I'll stay here.
Hello.
I...
So long.
How do you do, Mrs. Joad? How do you do?
My, you sure look pretty.
Please to dance, ma'am?
Thank you kindly, but she ain't well. - Sort of poorly.
Well, thank you just the same.
Howdy do.
Hey, Jackson. Look. Did you ever see them fellas before?
Sorry, neighbor, but we got to keep the camp clean.
I know one of them. Used to work with him. I never asked him to the dance though.
All right. Keep your eye on them. Just keep them in sight, that's all.
I seen them. A car with five men parked down by the eucalyptus trees.
And another with four men on the main road. And they got guns, I seen them.
Thank you, Willy. You done right good. You can run along and dance now.
Well, sure looks like the fat's in the fire this time.
What them deputies wanna hurt the camp for? How come they can't let us alone?
We ought to get some pickax handles...
No. That's just what they want.
No, sirree. If they can get a fight going they can call in the cops, say we ain't orderly.
They're here. We got them spotted.
Got everything ready?
There ain't gonna be trouble.
I don't want you hurting them.
Don't worry. Everything's arranged. Maybe nobody will even see it.
Well, just don't use no sticks or no knives or no piece of iron.
If you gotta sock them, sock them where they ain't gonna bleed.
Gentlemen, hats off, please.
She's getting prettier every day, Ma.
Girl with a baby's always prettier.
Come on, Ma, let's dance.
Oh, Tom. I can't.
Well, all right.
Tom, stop.
Come and sit by my side if you love me
Do not hasten to bid me adieu
But remember the Red River Valley
And the boy who had loved you so true
Nine-twenty-nine.
All right, 9:30.
All right. I'll dance with her.
You and who else?
Excuse me, Ma.
Open up! We're here about a riot!
Riot?
I don't see any riot. Who are you?
Deputy sheriffs.
Have you got a warrant?
We don't need a warrant when there's a riot.
I don't know what you're gonna do about it. I don't hear or see any riot.
What's more, I don't believe there is any riot. Look for yourself.
All right, let's go.
Oklahoma. E-L-2-0-4.
You have no right to arrest anybody without a warrant.
We'll have a warrant just as soon as we check with headquarters.
Tommy. Ain't you gonna tell me goodbye?
I didn't know, Ma. I didn't know if I ought to.
Ma...
Hush, Ruthie.
Come outside.
There was some cops here tonight. They was taking down license numbers.
I guess somebody knows something.
I guess it had to come sooner or later.
Sit down for a minute.
I'd like to stay, Ma.
I'd like to be with you and see your face when you and Pa get settled in some nice place.
I'd sure like to see you then.
But I won't never get that chance, I guess, now.
I could hide you, Tommy.
I know you would, but I ain't gonna let you.
You hide somebody that's killed a guy and you're in trouble too.
All right, Tommy.
But what do you figure you're gonna do?
You know what I've been thinking about?
About Casy.
About what he said what he done about how he died.
And I remember all of it.
He was a good man.
I've been thinking about us too.
About our people living like pigs and good, rich land laying fallow.
Or maybe one guy with a million acres and 100,000 farmers starving.
And I've been wondering if all our folks got together and yelled...
They'd drive you out and cut you down just like they done to Casy.
They're gonna drive me anyways.
Sooner or later they'd get me, for one thing if not for another. Until then...
Tommy. - You're not aiming to kill nobody?
No, Ma. Not that.
It's just... Well, as long as I'm an outlaw anyways, maybe I can do something.
Maybe I can just find out something.
Just scrounge around and maybe find out what it is that's wrong.
Then see if there ain't something that can be done about it.
I ain't thought it all out clear, Ma.
I can't. I don't know enough.
How am I gonna know about you, Tommy?
Why, they could kill you and I'd never know. They could hurt you. How am I gonna know?
Well, maybe it's like Casy says.
Fella ain't got a soul of his own, just a little piece of a big soul.
The one big soul that belongs to everybody.
Then...
Then what, Tom?
Then it don't matter.
I'll be all around in the dark.
I'll be everywhere wherever you can look.
Wherever there's a fight so hungry people can eat, I'll be there.
Wherever there's a cop beating up a guy, I'll be there.
I'll be in the way guys yell when they're mad.
I'll be in the way kids laugh when they're hungry and they know supper's ready.
And when the people are eating the stuff they raise and living in the houses they build I'll be there too.
I don't understand it, Tom.
Me neither, Ma, but it's just something I've been thinking about.
Give me your hand, Ma.
Goodbye.
Goodbye, Tommy. Later, when this is blowed over you'll come back?
Sure, Ma.
Tom, we ain't the kissing kind, but...
Goodbye, Ma.
Goodbye, Tommy.
Tommy.
Turn that up, Al, and get her rolled up. - How you fixed, John?
Getting along.
Here.
Winfield, get on top, out of the way.
I don't see what you folks are hurrying so for.
They tell me there's 20 days' work up there.
Yes, sir, and we aim to get in all 20 of them.
All ready, Ma? - Yes.
How you feeling, Rosasharn?
All aboard, everybody. All aboard for Fresno.
Wait a minute.
Careful of her, now.
She'll be all right.
Watch her, John.
I'll take care of her.
How are you fixed, Al?
All right, Pa.
Now, Ma...
Twenty days' work. Oh, boy!
I'll be glad to get my hands on some cotton. That's the kind of picking I understand.
Maybe. Maybe 20 days' work and maybe no days' work.
We ain't got it till we get it.
What's the matter, Ma?
Getting scared?
Scared.
Ha! I ain't never gonna be scared no more.
I was though.
For a while, it looked as though we was beat.
Looked like we didn't have nobody in the whole wide world but enemies. Like nobody was friendly no more.
Made me feel kind of bad and scared too. Like we was lost and nobody cared.
You're the one that keeps us going, Ma. I ain't no good no more and I know it.
Seems like I spend all my time these days thinking how it used to be.
Thinking of home.
I ain't never gonna see it no more.
Well, Pa, a woman can change better than a man.
A man lives sort of, well, in jerks.
Baby's born or somebody dies, and that's a jerk.
He gets a farm or loses it, and that's a jerk.
With a woman, it's all in one flow like a stream.
Little eddies and waterfalls, but the river, it goes right on.
A woman looks at it that way.
Maybe, but we're sure taking a beating.
I know. That's what makes us tough.
Rich fellas come up and they die and their kids ain't no good, and they die out.
But we keep coming.
We're the people that live.
They can't wipe us out. They can't lick us.
We'll go on forever, Pa, because we're the people.
By the end of the World War Tomainia weakened.
Revolution had broken out, her diplomats sued for peace while Tomainia's army fought on, confident its war machine would smash the enemy's lines.
Big Bertha, able to fire 100 miles, was to make its appearance on the Western Front, and strike terror into the enemy.
75 miles away was her target: the cathedral of Notre-Dame.
Range: 95,452.
Stand clear!
Fire!
Stand by your trigger!
Range correction: 95,455.
Breach secured.
Stand clear.
Ready... Fire!
Defective shell. We'll examine it.
Check the fuse.
Yes, the fuse.
Look out! Run!
What's that?
Air raid.
After Big Bertha.
The anti-aircraft gun!
To the gun!
Have you gone crazy?
Come down!
What do you think you're doing? Have you gone crazy?
Sir, the enemy have broken through. Every man to the front.
Muster the gun crew!
Get your hand grenades, soldiers.
Where's your hand grenade?
Give him one.
Keep moving. Come along, hurry up!
Pardon me, but to work this...
Pull the pin, count to ten and throw it!
Let them have it!
This is no time to scratch.
Pull yourself together.
Take this.
Forward!
Fall in!
Hey you, come on!
Order arms!
Prepare to attack.
Forward!
There you are.
The enemy! Come on, let's get him!
May I come in, sir?
Who is it?
Friend.
What division?
21st artillery, sir.
Take this and keep firing. I'll be back.
Comrade! Help!
What is it?
I'm exhausted. Quick, help me to my plane.
Thank you. I'll see you get the Tomainian Cross for this.
Only too willing to oblige, sir.
You saved my life. Thank you.
I'll strap you in.
I can't make it alone. You'll have to stay with me.
Can you fly?
I can try.
Lift my hand to the stick. I haven't the strength.
Take charge of that gun!
The enemy! Quick, lift my hand to the throttle.
We'll fool 'em!
Hold on to these dispatches.
If we get them to General Schmelloffel,
Tomainia may yet win.
I'm going to faint.
Don't say that.
Sorry.
Where am I?
Don't you know me?
Yes, I feel better now.
The blood's returning to my head.
What's below?
The sun?
Shining upwards.
Strange. How's the gas?
Kept me awake all night.
No, the gasoline in the tank!
Almost empty.
We must be nearly there. What time is it?
Approximately one minute to twelve.
Strange.
We seem to be defying the laws of gravity.
Water. Quick, I'm going to faint.
Wait a while.
We'll get into trouble if you faint any more.
Just hold it.
I think I... Now...
Take it!
Something's wrong.
I can't reach it.
It's all gone.
What's the matter?
Belt too tight.
Loosen it.
I'm trying to!
We're upside down.
I know it!
The stick!
Impossible.
There it goes. We're out of gas.
Well, I suppose this is the end. Cigarette?
Not now!
I shan't need this any more.
What month is it?
April. Spring in Tomainia.
Hilda will be in the garden, tending the daffodils.
How she loves daffodils!
She'd never cut them for fear of hurting them.
It was like taking a life to cut a daffodil.
Sweet, gentle Hilda.
A beautiful soul.
She loved animals, and little children, too.
We've landed! Dispatches!
Comrade, where are you?
The dispatches... Where are they?
Are you hurt?
Take me to General Schmelloffel.
If we don't deliver these, we're defeated.
The war's over. - What?
We lost.
Hynkel takes power.
The Jewish soldier suffered a loss of memory and remained in hospital for years, ignorant of the change in Tomainia.
Hynkel ruled the nation with an iron fist.
Under the double-cross emblem liberty was banished.
Only the voice of Hynkel was heard.
Adenoid Hynkel said,
Tomainia was down but today has risen."
Democracy is fragrant."
Liberty is odious."
Freedom of speech is objectionable."
Tomainia has the greatest army."
The greatest navy."
But to remain great we must sacrifice."
We must tighten our belts."
He now speaks to Field Marshal Herring, Minister of War.
Now Herr Garbitsch, Minister of the Interior.
He remembers his early struggles, shared by his two loyal comrades.
A reference to the Jewish people.
The Phooey remarks that for the world he has peace in his heart.
We now pause for station identification.
This is the Pari-Mutual network, bringing you
Hynkel's address to the children of the double-cross.
The interpreter is Hynkel's personal translator, reading from a prepared manuscript.
Stand by for further commentary. Go ahead, Tomainia.
His Excellency is about to descend the stairs.
Your Excellency, are you hurt?
Ride in the other car.
His Excellency seems pleased as he is greeted by Tomainian children.
He pauses before a woman with a child.
Camera!
Even the baby is thrilled and seems all smiles at the attention.
His Excellency leaves the scene and will return along Hynkelstrasse, where he'll pass Tomainia's modern masterpieces:
the Venus of Today and the Thinker of Tomorrow.
How was it?
Very good.
Your reference to the Jews might have been more violent.
What?
To arouse the people's anger.
Violence against the Jews might make the people forget their stomach.
You're right. Things have been quiet in the ghetto lately.
Good morning, Mr. Jaeckel.
What's good about it?
Conditions could be worse.
If you think so, you have a great imagination.
You heard Hynkel's speech.
I heard nothing. I've got my own troubles.
You're better off than a lot of people.
What about the barber?
Still in hospital.
He's been there since the war.
Why not rent his barbershop for him?
He won't let me. Every few weeks he writes to say he's coming back.
A pity it should be idle all these years.
Why worry?
The government will soon take it from him.
Perhaps you're right. Not such a good morning after all.
Now you said it.
Hannah.
On the mantelpiece is my tobacco pouch. Will you get it?
Everyone is full of troubles.
Yeah, everyone. Look at Hannah, poor girl.
A hard worker, can't get a job.
Father was killed in the war, mother died last year.
Can't earn enough to pay her rent.
What can I do? I can't throw her out.
You need some more.
Where are you going? - Mrs. Shoemaker's laundry.
You'd better take the key. Mrs. Jaeckel and I are going out.
I'm locking up in case the storm troopers start their monkey business again.
Look, fellows! Tomatoes and potatoes.
I'll take a box home.
Hey, the lorry.
Hold it there, will you?
You have no right!
Just charge it to my account!
Nice ripe tomatoes.
Why don't some of you do something?
If I were a man I'd show you.
What would you do, pretty?
Not one of you has the guts to stand up alone and fight!
Is the lorry in case someone hits back?
Shut up!
Come and take me. You'll get medals for it.
You pick on women and rob defenceless people.
Don't rob the poor girl, boys. Give her back her tomatoes.
I'll have to do it again.
Pigs!
Patient 33!
Yes, sir.
An interesting case: amnesia.
Jewish soldier. Been here since the war.
He thinks it's only been weeks.
Does he knows what's happened?
No.
His one interest seems to be in his barbershop, which he believes he left a few weeks ago.
He'll have many surprises.
I'm afraid so.
Yes? - Number 33 is gone.
He was to be examined.
But he's disappeared.
Disappeared?
Let him go. It isn't a serious case.
There's little we can do for him.
Come on, get out of here!
What are you doing?
I don't know.
Leave that alone.
Don't be silly.
I'm not silly! I appreciate that.
When you talk to me, "Hail Hynkel"!
Who are you?
I'll show you who I am! Come down to headquarters!
That's my shop.
I don't care if it is or not.
Going to put up a fight, are you?
Come to headquarters.
Let me tell you something.
Policeman?
Arrest that man for assault.
Come here, you!
Leave me alone. Attacking a storm trooper!
You'll hear from my lawyer.
He bit my finger!
Sorry, I didn't mean to hit you.
I enjoyed that.
But you'd better beat it.
I'll call a policeman.
No!
Why not?
Are you crazy? More are coming!
More what?
Come in here.
What's wrong with you? Don't be foolhardy.
What's this?
Who hit you? I think it was a gang.
You'd better get fixed up. We'll investigate later.
What time is it?
All right, they've gone.
Thanks, mister. That did me a lot of good.
You've sure got some nerve.
We should all fight back.
We can't fight alone, but we can lick 'em together.
We didn't do so bad.
You're the barber, who was in hospital!
Mr. Jaeckel has talked about you.
We didn't think you'd come back.
The storm troopers will be after you.
You'd better hide. I'll get the key to the cellar.
Is this the man?
That's him. Hail Hynkel!
Who's he?
Don't fool with me.
Your hands.
Just a moment. Not here.
First you'll finish this.
Go on, paint that!
Wait a minute, boys. I've got a bright idea.
Commander Schultz!
First in command.
Second in command.
Oh, never mind.
You! Who told you to hang people from lampposts?
What was the trouble?
A Jew attacking storm troopers.
Where is he?
There. Break ranks.
So there you are.
Get up.
You? Don't you remember me?
You saved my life.
Me? Strange. And I always thought of you as an Aryan.
I'm a vegetarian.
Don't you remember? We got away in my plane.
Plane?
Then we crashed.
Now I remember.
Well, how are you?
What's my friend done? He resisted my men painting his windows.
Any brave man would resist.
I'm sorry for this.
No harm.
In future you will not be molested again.
If you or your friends ever need help...
Who did that?
One of my friends.
Hynkel's palace was the centre of the world's greatest war machine.
Behind it was the dynamic Adenoid Hynkel, whose genius ran the nation, whose ceaseless activity kept him occupied every moment of the day.
Marshal Herring is waiting.
Enough!
I believe we've got something now.
A bulletproof uniform. The material is as light as silk.
Where?
I've arranged for a demonstration. It will only take two minutes.
I can spare one.
Professor Herr Kibitzen.
Actions speak louder than words. A bulletproof uniform.
One hundred percent perfect.
Shoot!
Far from perfect.
Where's my secretary?
In the outer office.
Take a letter.
Herring here in the tower room. We've got something marvellous.
I shall be up.
A parachute. The most compact in the world.
Worn like a hat.
It will open in 25 feet.
Demonstrate, professor.
Herring, why do you waste my time like this?
Send Garbitsch here.
Herr Garbitsch is waiting.
Enough!
What's the meaning of this?
25 million for prison camps? We need to manufacture munitions.
We've made a few arrests.
How many?
Five or ten thousand... a day.
A day? - Just a few dissenters.
Dissenting about?
Working hours, wage cuts, the synthetic food, the quality of the sawdust in the bread.
What more do they want?
It's from the finest lumber!
Nevertheless, the people are overworked. They need diversion.
The people, bah!
We might go further with the Jews.
Burn some of their houses. An assault on the ghetto.
Something more dramatic. When can we be ready to invade Osterlich?
Three months.
I can't wait. Napaloni's army might invade first.
We must strike now.
We'll require foreign capital.
Borrow it! The bankers have refused.
One man might make us a loan:
Epstein. - Epstein?
He's a Jew, isn't he?
Well, let's be big about it. We'll borrow from Epstein.
It might be difficult in view of our policy towards his people.
Then we'll change our policy.
Tell Schultz all persecution of the Jews must cease.
At least till we've negotiated this loan.
I don't understand it. The whole ghetto is so quiet.
You can't imagine what was going on.
This Hynkel business.
You weren't here, you were in the hospital, unconscious.
You don't appreciate what a good time you were having.
If things get worse we can go to Osterlich.
That's still free.
Sooner or later we'll have to go.
Anyway, it's nice to see you back.
It's like the old days again, eh?
How's business?
Very slow.
The men are in concentration camp.
You should fix up the women.
The beauty parlour business.
Know anything about it?
You can learn. You can practise on Hannah.
Hannah, get in that chair, we'll make you look beautiful.
What for?
He's going to practise on you.
Not with mud on my face?
No, we'll take some off.
Make me look beautiful?
Sure. He can't make you look any worse!
Mrs. Shoemaker's laundry!
I'll give it to her. You sit here and enjoy yourself.
I know. I've seen you making eyes.
Don't pay any attention to him.
I like your shop since it's fixed up.
I wish I had a business like this. There's no future in housework.
Maybe if I save my money I can have a barbershop some day.
But I can never save. Money slips through my fingers.
I've always lived up to every penny I've earned.
Why shouldn't I? You're here today and gone tomorrow.
Do you believe in God?
I do. But if there wasn't one, would you live any different?
I wouldn't.
Life could be wonderful if people'd leave you alone.
Things are looking brighter now.
Maybe because of you saving Schultz.
Funny how they've left us alone.
Too good to be true.
Do you ever daydream?
That's the only time I'm really happy: dreaming.
Sometimes I get so carried away I don't know what I'm doing.
Aren't you like that?
We're very much alike.
Both absent-minded.
I like absent-minded people.
Like the man who put his watch in boiling water and held the egg!
All great men are absent-minded.
My folks didn't think so.
You have an excuse. You were injured in the war.
I was born that way.
I wonder why women never grow whiskers.
Isn't that foolish of me?
I could kick myself in the shins, I could...
I'll give you a shampoo.
Ain't I cute?
How did you do it?
You should try it on yourself.
Fixed up, you'd look handsome.
Four pecks a pound, new potatoes! The potato man!
Take it easy there.
Did you hurt yourself?
Careful next time.
Here's another one.
How do you do?
Something's happened. The storm troopers helped me up.
How wonderful if they stopped hating us, if they let us go about our business like we used to.
How wonderful if we didn't have to go to another country.
I don't want to go.
With all the persecution, I still love it here.
Perhaps we don't have to go.
Wouldn't it be wonderful if they'd let us live and be happy again?
Nothing works! Not even a sharp pencil.
I'm surrounded by incompetent, stupid, sterile stenographers.
I'll get you a pen.
Don't bother! I won't send it.
Get out, get out!
We've just discovered the most wonderful poison gas.
It will kill everybody...
All right. Later.
B76 to see Herr Herring.
A lady. My secret agent.
Your secret agent? Tell her to come here.
Have B76 come right in.
Any news from Epstein?
Our agent reports that all the board of directors are Aryans.
The loan's bound to go through. - Good.
A strike at the arms factory.
The leader?
Five of them.
Have them shot.
They were.
How many were going to strike?
Three thousand of them.
Have them all shot. I don't want dissatisfied workers.
These men are skilled craftsmen.
Let's train others first, then shoot them!
Cannot afford to be lenient.
The rhythm of production will be affected.
Rhythm... All right, have your rhythm.
Spare the strikers and permit them to return to work.
But mark them for future reference.
That's my department. I'll attend to that. This way.
The strike leaders are all brunettes. Not one blond.
Troublemakers! Worse than Jews.
Then wipe them out!
Doucement".
We'll get rid of the Jews first, then concentrate on the brunettes.
We shall never have peace till we have a pure Aryan race.
How wonderful! Tomainia, a nation of blue-eyed blonds.
Why not a blond Europe, Asia, America?
And a brunette dictator.
Of the world! Why not?
Aut Caesar aut nullus. The world's effete, worn out, afraid.
No nation would dare oppose you.
Dictator of the World!
It's your destiny. We'll kill off the Jews, wipe out the brunettes, then will come forth a pure Aryan race.
Beautiful blond Aryans.
They will love you, they will worship you as a god.
No, you mustn't say it.
You make me afraid of myself.
Dictator of the World!
We'll invade Osterlich first. After that we can bluff.
The nations will capitulate.
The world will be under your thumb.
Leave me! I want to be alone.
Aut Caesar aut nullus.
Emperor of the World!
My world.
The happy hour programme.
Work with the rhythm of music.
Our next selection: Brahms' Hungarian Dance number five.
Fifteen cents, please.
Happy hour signing off.
At six, Adenoid Hynkel will address the children of the double-cross.
It seems like the old days again.
How long is it going to last?
In the papers it's rumoured that Hynkel's going to give the Jews back their rights.
Maybe.
What do you want?
Business is much better. Nobody interferes with us any more.
Doesn't that make you feel good?
The trouble, Mr. Jaeckel, is you're so used to bad times, you're unhappy without them.
Get my Sunday shoes. They're on the windowsill.
I can't find the shawl.
I've got a shawl.
What's going on?
They're dressing Hannah up to go out.
Is that so?
She's got a beau.
Who is it?
The barber.
Now, turn around.
My dear! Those hands!
What's the matter with them?
Those calluses. They're so rough.
Maybe I better not go.
Don't be foolish. He knows you do housework.
Wait! I'll get a pair of mittens.
See if he's ready.
Not yet. He's polishing a bald man's head.
Bad news. The invasion of Osterlich will have to be delayed.
What? - Epstein refuses to lend the money.
Epstein refuses, eh?
Send for Schultz.
Epstein refuses.
What did he say?
He complained of the persecution and said he wouldn't have any dealings with a mediaeval maniac.
He'll deal with a mediaeval maniac more than he thinks!
First I shall deal with his people.
Your Excellency?
Call out the storm troopers.
A little mediaeval entertainment in the ghetto!
At such a time I think it ill-advised.
Such demonstrations demoralise the country.
Indeed?
Since when do you care about the ghetto?
I speak in the interests of our party and the cause of humanity.
You need a holiday.
Fresh air.
A little outdoor exercise.
I'll send you to a concentration camp.
Place Schultz under arrest.
Very well, but remember my words.
Your cause is doomed to failure because it is built on the stupid persecution of innocent people.
Your policy is worse than a crime. It's a tragic blunder.
Traitor! Traitor!
You're a double-dyed democrat!
Schultz, why have you forsaken me?
Excellency, here are the notes for your speech.
I'll not need them.
What I say will not be directed to the children of the double-cross but to the children of Israel!
That Hynkel isn't such a bad fellow after all.
Most amusing.
Get a Hynkel badge! A Hynkel badge!
A fine photo on each!
We'd better go home. - Yeah.
Let's hurry.
Wait a minute.
What's that?
Turn off the radio.
The storm troopers!
Bar that door!
Get some water!
Get the women and children upstairs. Lock all the doors.
You men, stay right here.
We've got to make a stand.
We might as well die as live like this.
Wait a minute. We have a social call to make here.
Wait a minute!
Schultz gave strict orders not to molest anyone in this court.
These Jews attacked us.
I don't care.
Orders were to keep out.
You saw that!
I can't help it. Schultz's orders.
Let's get going.
Orders or not, I'm going to get that girl.
Out!
Schultz arrested!
Hear that?
He's arrested Commander Schultz.
A Jew corrupted our commander. - Let's kill the louse!
Schultz is accused of treason, and you know why.
Schultz was a friend of that barber.
Let's get the barber! We want the barber!
It's the storm troopers!
Get on the roof.
They'll kill you!
I'll fight.
Don't be a fool, you'll be murdered. Get on the roof.
All right, here we are. Smash in the door!
Come on, we'll give the barber a haircut!
Where are the bombs?
There goes the barbershop!
Never mind. We can start again.
We can go to Osterlich. That's still free.
Mr. Jaeckel says it's beautiful.
Wonderful green fields, and they grow apples and grapes.
His brother's got a vineyard.
Mr. Jaeckel said he'd take me with him.
Now we can all go together.
It'll be wonderful living in the country, much better than a smoky old city.
And if we work hard and don't eat much, we can save money and buy a chicken farm.
There's money to be made in chickens.
Look at that star!
Isn't it beautiful!
Hynkel with all his power can never touch that.
All right, the coast is clear.
Commander Schultz escaped. He's hiding in my cellar.
He's holding a meeting at midnight and he wants you to be there.
Hannah, you come and help Mrs. Jaeckel with the supper.
All right, I'll be down.
I don't understand it. This crazy midnight supper...
What does this Schultz want of us?
He wants us to blow up the palace. - What?
We Jewish people shouldn't get mixed up in such a business.
I know it but Schultz has them all hypnotised.
I knew he was up to some mischief. - Sure he is.
I found him putting a coin in one of your puddings.
Don't worry, I've fixed everything. Wait and see.
Gentlemen, may I claim your indulgence for a moment?
We are here tonight to rid the country of a tyrant.
In order to carry this out one of us must die.
In ancient times the Aryan tribe of the Langobardians made human sacrifice to the god Thor.
At a feast by lottery the victim was chosen.
Tonight, at this feast, one of you will be chosen.
Each man will receive a pudding.
Concealed in one of these is a coin.
Whoever gets it must give up his life but he will join the long line of history's noble martyrs and will rid his country of a tyrant.
I know that it is the wish of all of us to be chosen this night to die for Tomainia.
Much as I should like to participate in this ordeal, I cannot...
Why?
Don't you understand?
He's too well known.
It must be somebody like us.
I can't see it like that.
It is a question of my honour. It is very embarrassing.
Commander Schultz, I apologise for my friend.
Let me say, on behalf of myself and the others, that we consider it a great privilege to die for our country.
Very well, then.
Gentlemen, I shall now retire until fate has chosen the liberator.
Until then... Hail Hynk...
What am I saying?
Gentlemen, we have pledged our honour.
Proceed!
Gentlemen, the coin is here!
What's the meaning of this?
Somebody made a fool of us.
I did. - What?
I put a coin in every pudding.
Blowing up palaces and wanting to kill people!
We're in enough trouble!
Hannah's right. We've all been foolish.
Our place is at home, looking after our own affairs.
The papers say Schultz may be in the ghetto.
Here, read it for yourself.
Hannah, read that.
Mystery surrounds the disappearance of ex-Commander Schultz.
At police HQ it was believed he may be hiding in the ghetto.
A certain Jewish barber, reported to be a friend of Schultz,
is wanted for questioning."
Me?
Only for questioning. Not too serious.
Meyerberg was only wanted for questioning. We never saw him again.
Who is it?
It's me, Mr. Mann.
Did you hear what they're saying about Schultz hiding in the ghetto?
I know, I know.
Don't you think it's serious if they find him in the house?
Don't you realise there are spies everywhere!
Spies?
What's the matter?
He's wanted for questioning.
Where's the Commander?
In the next room.
If Commander Schultz is found in this house, we'll all go to a concentration camp and have our heads cut off, too!
Am I arguing?
Then get rid of him.
You can't throw him out.
Of course not.
But I'd like to know how long he's going to stay here.
Your breakfast is on the table.
Thank you. I have breakfast waiting at home.
Search every house.
What now?
They're looking for Schultz.
He's in one of these houses.
They're always looking for somebody.
It's me. Let me in.
The storm troopers are searching every house.
Tell the Commander.
Did you tell him?
Yes.
What is it?
The storm troopers.
What? - You'd both better get on the roof.
We can't leave all these things.
All of you, pack my cases.
You pack that.
Clear this shelf.
Pack this and this.
This mustn't be found.
Open the door.
They're here! Get up on the roof.
Nothing left behind!
My golf clubs!
The hatbox!
Take this.
Come on, let's hurry!
Where are you going?
You'll see him later.
I'll meet you tonight.
All right.
Take this.
Quick!
Stop!
Look where you are!
I can't see, wait a moment.
My bag!
It's right here. Here it is.
Don't drop the other one.
My golf clubs, not my golf clubs!
Come here. They'll see you.
Quick, this way!
Woah, steady!
Now be careful.
Yes, sir.
Lucky you didn't break your neck.
You'll pardon me.
I'm sorry.
You guard the back. Wait a minute!
I'll have to bother you again.
There he is.
How are you?
So-so.
Here's your friend.
Your silence will be appreciated.
Take him to the wagon.
Where are you going?
Smoking room.
Come on, this way!
I am pleased to announce that we are at last ready to march on Osterlich.
This was made possible by the genius of Field Marshal Herring, upon whom I shall now pin a token of my regard.
Turn around.
Gentlemen.
To Field Marshal Herring!
To the invasion of Osterlich!
Elephant!
Wait.
Napaloni's army is on the Osterlich front.
60,000 men are on the border.
To take Osterlich!
I can't believe it.
You can't believe it!
You let him steal a march on us.
I had the ground covered.
Declare war on Napaloni!
Mobilise every division of the army and air force.
Attack Bacteria at once!
But... - Do as I tell you!
Madness.
Shut up! Will you sign this?
What is it?
A declaration of war.
Yes. A pen!
I'll sign it.
A pen!
I'll sign it! Napaloni...
It's Napaloni.
Wait a minute.
Napaloni?
You talk to him.
What'll I say?
Be nice, affable, pleasant.
Well, well, how are you?
No, he hasn't been playing much.
You went round in 92?
His Excellency?
Just now he's a little hoarse.
No, I mean he can't talk.
May I take a message?
He says no doubt you've heard about Osterlich.
He wants to discuss it.
Ask him to come here.
His Excellency invites you to Tomainia to discuss the matter.
Very well. I'll make the arrangements.
He's coming.
Good.
We'll put on the greatest military show the world has ever known.
Napaloni will leave the invasion of Osterlich to me.
And this?
What is it?
Your declaration of war.
Peace is declared!
2,975,000 eager citizens are massed in the station square awaiting Benzino Napaloni.
Entering the station is our Phooey, ready to greet his guest.
This will cement the friendship between our Phooey and the Dictator of Bacteria.
His Excellency is about to greet the Bacterian ambassador.
How do you do?
Garbitsch...
See about the photography.
Tell the press to see that our Phooey is well photographed.
Not the back of his head! - Yes, sir.
Napaloni's train is coming into the station.
From a pink and white carriage
Napaloni and his wife will step out and Adenoid Hynkel will deliver his address of welcome.
What's all this mix-up-a?
They've gone too far.
At ease!
Bring the carpet.
Why can't -a we get out here?
No-a carpet.
Who cares?
Me, Napaloni, I never get out without a carpet.
Quick. - It's going back.
What?
Let's get out while it's stopping.
Shut up!
Take it away!
Stay here until they've made up their minds.
You got-a da carpet. Put it down!
My friend!
Napaloni!
This is indeed a pleasure. Welcome to Tomainia. This way.
Pictures!
Sure. Salute!
Another, please.
This is a pleasure, my friend Hynkel.
You want another?
There.
Where's -a my ambassador?
Hello, Spook.
How do you feel? Look after mamma.
Hynky, did you meet-a my wife?
That's her. Let's go.
Tomainia... very nice, very nice.
Your clock is-a slow.
This way.
It's -a very nice people.
The people are very nice.
Thank you.
He's my husband!
You make a mistake! You make a big-a mistake!
Napaloni's army shall not invade Osterlich. It belongs to me!
We shall not discuss the Osterlich situation.
This interview is to impress on him the force of your personality.
To make him feel your superiority.
Napaloni is aggressive, domineering.
We must put him in his place.
But how?
By means of psychology.
By making him feel inferior.
This can be done subtly.
For instance,
I have arranged that he'll be looking up at you, you looking down at him.
His position will be inferior.
Then again we shall seat him here beside your bust so that if you relax that will always be glaring at him.
Where is he now?
Resting.
I have arranged that he will enter from the far end of the room.
Another psychological triumph.
He will have the embarrassment of walking the entire floor.
Signor Napaloni is now leaving his room.
He's coming. Quick, give me a flower.
At all times be above him, before him.
Entering or leaving you must be first.
Hello, Hynky!
How are you feel?
My brother dictate!
You're a nice-a little man. I'm so glad to see you again.
And my friend the Garbitsch!
This is a lovely place.
I feel-a fine.
I just had a nice cold shower. When you have the plumbing fixed it'll be in good shape.
Won't you sit down?
Well, Hynky, my dictator friend, you.
I must be a-growing!
What do they give me? A baby stool?
This is not for me. I like it better upstairs.
Garbitsch, this is a lovely country.
Very nice-a people.
I thought the public enthusiastic. Sure.
They like to see new faces.
I'm sorry for the mishap that occurred to Madam Napaloni.
What's that?
I'm sorry for the Napaloni that occurred at the... at...
Madam Napaloni at the station.
She's not used to public life. She can't take it.
Match.
I'm sorry...
Don't apologise. I find-a one.
I'm simply crazy about this palace.
Ivory and gold. A lovely combination.
Gets away from that gingerbread idea.
Tell me something, Garbitsch, what's on the programme?
The grand ball this evening.
And a review of the army.
That won't take-a long!
I'm afraid it will.
So you got a big army, huh?
Modesty forbids.
Seems I've heard about it.
I think I'll get me a shave.
We have a barbershop.
Is that so?
You look blue under the gills. What do you say we go together?
Delighted.
Good!
Very well, this way.
This is it. I can-a smell 'em.
This is-a very sweet. It was the library.
A good barbershop.
Too old-fashioned.
Is that so?
When I get shaved I like something to look at.
So I'm putting in glass walls.
This way, I shall have a view of the mountains.
And this, a view through the glass ceiling.
What's above?
The ballroom.
In my summer palace I have a barbershop.
Is that so?
Also with glass walls.
You don't tell me!
With goldfish inside.
Goldfish swimming inside the walls?
How do you feed them?
You can't, they're all dead. That's why I'm building a new one.
Very interesting!
You like it?
The Hynkel stadium.
Before half a million spectators the greatest ever display of arms marches by in review.
Our beloved Phooey and I'll-Dig-a-Ditchy are seated, thrilled by this historic event.
What?
Nothing. I'm just chewing.
Some peanuts?
I've had some. - Good shape.
Here you are, Spook.
Now passing, Tomainia's heavy artillery.
It's all right.
I want to show you my new bombing planes. They're coming over.
Where from? - Aroma.
Aroma?
That's 400 miles away.
Right. I don't know what's detaining them.
Now passing, Tomainia's light artillery.
Very light!
And here come the armoured tanks, the pride of Tomainia's army.
The latest design, the last word in modern warfare.
Where's the propellers?
For going under the water!
Under water?
You never heard of tanks that go under the water and fly up-a stairs?
What's that? - Under the water and in the air.
Obsolete now! We're concentrating on flying dreadnoughts.
What's that? - My planes!
Now passing, Hynkel's flying division number 34.
Our planes!
You're right. They're yours.
Garbitsch! The invasion of Osterlich.
Our troops, tanks and guns will be hidden along the border.
To disarm suspicion, you will go hunting.
Then you will show up at Pretzelburg, meet the army, step into a car and cross over into Osterlich.
Herring and I will be waiting at the capital.
First Napaloni must remove his troops.
To be decided tonight.
Where is Napaloni?
I'll look for him.
It might be advisable for you to dance with Madam Napaloni.
It'll carry weight.
You mean I will!
You find him! And let me know at once.
Madam Napaloni... - Your Excellency!
Why so triste?
Because I no speak.
No? May I have the pleasure?
Allow me.
Madam, your dancing was superb.
Excellent.
Very good.
My dear Adenoid. - Benzino!
I've been looking for you.
Let's go to some quiet place where we can talk-a things over.
As you wish. - An excellent idea. To the buffet!
Of course, this way.
There's a Tomainian proverb...
Funny. I wish I understand it.
Now about the border.
Yes. No problem.
It should be no trouble.
What's the matter?
Wait.
You, too. Out!
Out.
So... the border question. - Yes.
It's just a matter of detail. Formalities.
Strawberries!
Have you any English mustard?
English mustard.
That's da hot-a stuff?
Very hot.
Cream.
Hynky, I'm going to make this very simple.
You agree not to invade Osterlich,
I agree not to invade Osterlich.
We sign, then I remove my troops from the border.
When your troops are gone, I sign.
That's -a right.
Just a minute, you don't understand.
First we sign, then I remove-a da troops.
Precisely. I sign after. - Just a minute.
Hey, Spook, treaty.
Hold-a dis.
Now, look, you sign-a dis treaty first.
Then I remove my troops after.
Why are we arguing?
You said I remove first.
I can't sign while they're there.
I won't remove them till you sign. - Why not?
Why should I?
Osterlich is a free country!
Your soldiers are there.
And they'll stay until you sign.
I'll blow them off.
This won't get us anywhere.
To quote an old Latin phrase...
Strawberries!
Where's -a my sandwich?
Another one!
I don't get this treatment in my own joint!
Can't we discuss this without passion?
I'm not-a passionate. I'm just...
I want him to sign the treaty.
What would my people think, signing such a treaty when your soldiers are on the border?
I won't move until you sign!
Not until you clear the border will I sign!
Then they remain.
Then I kick them off.
One move from you and my artillery will blow you to pieces!
And my aeroplanes will bomb your artillery like that!
You want-a start a world war?
You and the world I'll throw in the ocean!
Strawberries!
Your Excellency, we have...
I got-a my guns here in the pass and I'll blow him to pieces.
What's the matter? What ails you?
This isn't like you.
Hey, Garbitsch, come here.
What's with Hynky?
Mustard on his strawberries.
What else can you expect from Hynky?
The Bacterian...
Tomainia...
You cannot treat Bacteria this way.
I'll take the Bacterian people and tear them apart, like this!
Look what he's doing! It's an insult to my people!
He's -a tearing spaghetti!
He sign-a the treaty or we have a war!
Give me a-something! Quick, give me a-something!
I have an appointment.
What's this? Press.
How's the conference progressing?
Very successfully. How did you get in?
How did he get here?
No one is to enter the palace under any circumstances, understand?
There are minor details to be cleaned up...
Excuse me, we're busy.
The whole world will know we're fighting!
So what? - Can't we come to an agreement?
When he signs.
I sign nothing.
I must speak to you alone. Do you mind?
Mind? I don't mind!
Sign! Sign!
He'll have the advantage.
It's a mere scrap of paper.
When his troops are off the border, we can move in.
I'll sign.
What?
Hold-a this.
Ah, my little Hynky! My dictator brother!
I knew we have-a no trouble.
Two prisoners escaped in officers' uniforms.
Sound the alarm! Two prisoners escaped.
The planes are searching for us.
The woods.
No, the open. The border's that way.
The invasion of Osterlich.
Now or never.
Ducks.
Did you hear that?
It came from over there.
A yodeller.
Where did you get that outfit?
What? - Don't answer back!
Where's Schultz?
You won't talk, eh?
He will when we get him to camp. - Come on.
There it is. The village of Pretzelburg.
If we can pass through there we're safe.
Through the woods?
They're swarming with soldiers. They'd suspect us at once.
If you see anyone, don't look right or left.
We must bluff our way through.
Here they come.
Can you see what they're doing?
Looking this way.
Keep going!
They're following us. Shall we run?
Certainly not.
Just a little bit?
Keep walking!
We could walk faster.
Make up your mind.
Slow down?
No!
There's no hurry.
He's here!
Sound assembly!
Turn back?
No, keep going!
Hail Hynkel!
Your Excellency, everything is under control.
Good.
Good.
I have been in communication with Marshal Herring in Osterlich.
The route is well guarded. Behind us are 200 tanks, 50 armoured cars and 500 machine-guns.
Good.
Good.
Are we ready to start?
Yes.
Yes.
Gentlemen.
Schultz, I'm happy you're with us again.
Thank you.
Where are we going?
You're invading Osterlich.
They're coming.
Your Excellency.
The world awaits your words.
What's happened?
He looks strange.
What's Schultz doing here?
Pardoned, I suppose.
His Excellency Herr Garbitsch,
Secretary of the Interior, Minister of Propaganda...
Victory shall come to the worthy.
Today, democracy, liberty and equality are words to fool the people.
No nation can progress with such ideas.
They stand in the way of action. Therefore, we abolish them.
In the future, each man will serve the state with absolute obedience.
Let him who refuses beware!
Citizenship will be taken away from all Jews and non-Aryans.
They are inferior and therefore enemies of the state.
It is the duty of all true Aryans to hate and despise them.
This nation is annexed to the Tomainian Empire, and the people will obey the laws bestowed on us by our great leader,
the Dictator of Tomainia, the conqueror of Osterlich, the future Emperor of the World!
You must speak.
I can't.
You must. It's our only hope.
Hope...
I'm sorry but I don't want to be an emperor.
That's not my business.
I don't want to rule or conquer anyone.
I should like to help everyone:
Jew, gentile, black man, white.
We all want to help one another. Human beings are like that.
We want to live by each other's happiness, not misery.
We don't want to hate one another.
In this world, the good earth is rich and can provide for everyone.
The way of life can be free and beautiful but we have lost the way.
Greed has poisoned men's souls, has barricaded the world with hate, has goose-stepped us into bloodshed.
We have developed speed but have shut ourselves in.
Machinery has left us in want.
Our knowledge has made us cynical, our cleverness, hard and unkind.
We think too much and feel too little.
More than machinery we need humanity.
More than cleverness we need kindness and gentleness.
Without these qualities, life will be violent and all will be lost...
The aeroplane and radio have brought us closer.
These inventions cry out for the goodness in man, cry out for universal brotherhood, for the unity of us all.
Even now my voice is reaching millions, millions of despairing men, women and children, victims of a system that makes men torture and imprison innocent people.
To those who can hear me I say, do not despair.
The misery upon us is but the passing of greed, the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress.
The hate of men will pass, and dictators die, and the power they took will return to the people.
So long as men die liberty will never perish.
Soldiers, don't give yourselves to brutes, men who despise you, enslave you, regiment your lives, tell you what to think and feel, who drill you, treat you like cattle and use you as cannon fodder.
Don't give yourselves to these men, machine men with machine minds and machine hearts.
You are not machines, you are not cattle, you are men!
You have the love of humanity in you.
Don't hate. Only the unloved and the unnatural hate.
Soldiers, don't fight for slavery, fight for liberty!
St. Luke says, "The Kingdom of God is within man."
Not in one man nor a group of men, but in all men. In you!
You have the power to create machines, the power to create happiness.
You have the power to make this life free and beautiful, to make this life a wonderful adventure.
In the name of democracy, let us use that power.
Let us all unite, let us fight for a new world, a world that will give men a chance to work, that will give youth a future and old age security.
Promising these things, brutes have risen.
But they lie! They do not fulfil that promise. They never will!
Dictators free themselves but they enslave the people.
Now let us fight to fulfil that promise!
Let us fight to free the world, to do away with national barriers, to do away with greed, with hate and intolerance.
Let us fight for a world of reason, a world where science and progress will lead to the happiness of all.
Soldiers, in the name of democracy, let us unite!
Hannah, can you hear me?
Wherever you are, look up, Hannah.
The clouds are lifting, the sun is breaking through.
We are coming out of the darkness into a new world, a kindlier world, where men will rise above their hate, their greed and their brutality.
Look up, Hannah.
The soul of man has been given wings.
He is flying into the rainbow, into the light of hope, into the future, the glorious future that belongs to you, to me and to all of us.
Look up, Hannah. Look up!
Did you hear that?
Listen...
Copy boy!
Make it snappy.
Where's the rest of this story?
Morning Post.
City desk?
Just a moment and I'll connect you.
If anybody asks for me, I'm down at the courthouse.
Elevator!
Going down.
Hello, Hildy.
Hi, Skinny.
Hello, Ruth, Maisie.
Is the lord of the universe in?
Yes, in a bad humor.
Somebody must've stolen the crown jewel.
Shall we announce you?
I'll blow my own horn.
Bruce, wait here. I'll be back in ten minutes.
Even ten minutes is a long time to be away from you.
What did you say?
Go on.
Well, go ahead.
I just said, "Even ten minutes is a long time to be away from you".
I heard you. I like it. That's why I asked you to say it again.
I like being spoiled.
The man I'm going in to see did little spoiling.
I'd like to spoil him. Want me to go with you?
I can handle it.
Lf it gets rough, I'm here.
I'll come running, partner.
Hello, Jim.
Hello, Hildy!
How are you?
Welcome back.
Hello, Hildy, how have you been?
Beatrice, how's "Advice to the Lovelorn"?
Fine. My cat had kittens again.
Your own fault.
Glad to see you. Hi, Jim.
Mildred, you still around?
A little more around the chin, boss.
What do you want?
Your ex-wife is here.
Hello, Hildy.
Hello, Walter.
Hello, Louie. How's the big slot machine king?
I ain't doing that no more. I'm retired. You know what I mean?
Walter.
I'm busy!
The governor didn't sign that reprieve.
Tomorrow, Earl Williams dies and makes a sucker out of us.
What are you going to do?
Phone the governor. - I can't.
Why not?
He's out fishing.
How many places are there?
At least two, Atlantic and Pacific.
That simplifies it, doesn't it?
Get him on the phone.
And say what?
Quiet, Duffy. He's thinking.
Tell him if he reprieves Earl Williams, we'll support him for senator.
Tell him the Morning Post will be behind him.
You can't do that.
Why not?
We've been a Democratic paper for over 20 years.
After we get the reprieve, we'll be Democratic again.
Go on, Duffy, get going.
The Morning Post expects every editor to do his duty.
You too, Louie.
Get out of here.
Well, Walter, I see you're still at it.
First time I double-crossed a governor. What can I do for you?
Would you mind if I sat down?
There's a lamp burning in the window for you. Here.
I jumped out of that window a long time ago, Walter.
May I have one of those?
Thank you.
And a match?
Thank you.
How long is it?
How long is what?
You know what.
How long is it since we've seen each other?
Well, let's see.
I spent six weeks in Reno, then Bermuda. About four months.
Seems like yesterday to me.
Maybe it was yesterday, Hildy.
Been seeing me in your dreams?
Mama doesn't dream about you. You wouldn't know her now.
Yes, I would. I'd know you anytime.
Any place, anywhere.
You're repeating yourself. You said that the night you proposed.
You still remember it.
If I didn't remember it, I wouldn't have divorced you.
I sort of wish you hadn't.
What?
Divorced me.
It makes a fellow lose faith in himself.
It gives him a feeling he wasn't wanted.
Junior, that's what divorces are for.
Nonsense, you've got an old-fashioned idea divorces last forever.
Till death do us part". Divorce doesn't mean anything nowadays.
Just a few words mumbled over you by a judge.
We've got something between us nothing can change.
I suppose you're right in a way.
Sure, I'm right.
I am fond of you, you know.
Thattagirl!
I often wish you weren't such a stinker.
You must meet my mother. She'd like that phrase.
Then why'd you promise not to fight the divorce and then gum up the works?
I meant to let you go, but you know you never miss the water till the well runs dry.
A big lummox like you, hiring an airplane to write:
Hildy, don't be hasty.
Remember my dimple. Walter".
It delayed our divorce while the judge watched it.
Not to brag, but I've still got the dimple, and in the same place.
I acted like any husband who didn't want to see his home broken up.
What home?
Remember the home I promised you?
Sure I do.
The one we were to have right after the honeymoon.
That honeymoon!
Was it my fault? Did I know that coal mine would have a cave-in?
I intended to be with you on our honeymoon.
Instead of two weeks in Atlantic City with my bridegroom I spent two weeks in a coal mine with John Kruptzky.
You don't deny it?
No. We beat the whole country on that story!
Suppose we did! That isn't what I got married for!
What is the good? Look, Walter.
I came to tell you to stop phoning me a dozen times a day sending me 20 telegrams...
I write a beautiful telegram, don't I?
Are you going to listen?
What's the use of fighting? I'll tell you what you do.
Come back to work on the paper, and if we can't get along we'll get married again.
What?
Sure, I haven't any hard feelings.
Walter, you're wonderful in a loathsome sort of way.
Be quiet so I can say what I have to.
Tell me over lunch.
I have a lunch date.
Break it.
I can't.
Hands off!
Are you playing osteopath?
Temper, temper.
You are no longer my husband and no longer my boss.
And you won't be my boss.
What does that mean?
Just what I say.
You're not coming back to work?
You're right for the first time today.
Got a better offer?
You bet!
Work for somebody else! That's the gratitude I get.
Stop hamming.
Five years ago, you were a college girl.
I took a doll-faced hick!
You wouldn't have if I wasn't doll-faced.
It was a novelty to have a face to look at without shuddering.
I made you a great reporter.
You won't be as good on any other paper.
We're a team. The paper needs both of us!
Sold American!
All right, go ahead.
Listen, Walter, please.
The paper's going to have to get along without me.
So will you.
It didn't work out.
It would have worked if you'd been satisfied as editor and reporter.
You had to marry me and spoil everything.
I wasn't satisfied?
I suppose I proposed to you!
Practically! Making eyes at me until I broke down.
Oh, Walter!" I was tight when I proposed to you.
If you'd been a gentleman, you'd have forgotten about it.
You used to pitch better than that.
Hello.
What?
Sweeney? What can I do for you?
What?
Wait a minute. I'm not Sweeney. I'm Duffy.
Sweeney, you can't do that to me. Not today, of all days!
What's the matter with you?
Are you a loony?
Now, listen, Sweeney.
This is no time...
All right, I suppose so. If you have to, you have to.
He had to.
Everything happens to me.
365 days in a year, and this has to be the day.
What's wrong?
Sweeney.
Dead?
He might as well be.
He picks today to have a baby!
Not on purpose?
He's supposed to cover the Earl Williams case, and where is he?
Walking up and down in a hospital. Is there no honor?
Haven't you got anybody else?
Nobody else on the paper can write.
This'll break me.
Unless...
Hildy!
You've got to help me.
Not a chance, Walter.
Get out of here, Duffy!
Save your breath.
This'll bring us back together again.
That's what I'm afraid of.
This is bigger than anything else.
Do it for the paper.
Scram, Svengali.
If you won't do it for love, how about money?
I'll raise you $25 a week.
Listen to me, you baboon...
I'll make it $35 and not a cent more.
Listen!
How much will the other paper pay?
There's no other paper.
Then the raise is off. You go back to your old salary.
Trying to blackjack me.
I'm busy.
Take a good look at it.
Do you know what it is?
It's an engagement ring.
Engagement ring?
I tried to tell you right away but you would start reminiscing.
I'm getting married, and I'm getting as far away from the newspaper business as I can get.
I'm through.
You can get married, but not quit. - No?
Why not?
I know what quitting would mean. - What?
It would kill you.
You can't sell me that.
You're a newspaperman.
I want to go someplace where I can be a woman.
You mean, be a traitor.
A traitor to what?
To journalism.
You're a journalist!
A journalist?
What does that mean?
Peeking through keyholes, chasing fire engines waking people up in the night to ask questions stealing pictures off old ladies?
I know all about reporters.
Buttinskies running around with no money, and for what?
So a million people will know what's going on.
Why, I...
What's the use?
Walter, you wouldn't know what it means to want to be respectable and live a halfway normal life.
The point is, I'm through.
Where did you meet this man?
Bermuda.
Rich?
He's not what you'd call rich. He makes about $5000 a year.
What's his line?
He's in the insurance business.
Insurance business?
That's a good honest business.
Sure, it's honest. It's also adventurous, romantic.
I can't picture you being surrounded by policies...
I can, and I like it, what's more.
Besides, he forgets the office when he's with me.
He doesn't treat me like an errand boy.
He treats me like a woman.
He does?
How did I treat you? Like a water buffalo?
I don't know from buffaloes, but I do know about him.
He's kind, he's sweet, and he's considerate.
He wants a home and children.
Sounds like a guy I ought to marry. What's his name?
Baldwin. Bruce Baldwin.
I knew a Baldwin once, a horse thief.
Couldn't be the same fellow, could it?
You are not talking about the man I'm marrying tomorrow.
Tomorrow?
As soon as that?
At last, I got out what I came up here to tell you.
Guess there isn't any more to the story.
So long, Walter.
So long, Hildy.
Better luck to you next time.
Thanks.
Well, you kind of took the wind out of my sail.
I just want to wish you everything I couldn't give you.
This other fellow. I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to see him.
I'm particular about whom my wife marries.
Where is he?
He's right on the job, waiting for me out there.
Do you mind if I meet him?
It wouldn't do any good.
You're not afraid, are you?
Of course not.
Let's see this paragon. Is he as good as you say?
He's better.
Then what does he want with you?
You got me.
Back in an hour, Mildred.
I am sorry, Hildy.
I suppose Bruce... What's his name?
I suppose he opens doors for you?
And with a lady, he takes his hat off.
I am sorry.
When he walks with a lady, he waits for her.
In that case...
Allow me.
I can see my wife picked out the right husband for herself.
There must be some mistake. I'm already married.
Already married?
You should have told me.
Congratulations again, Mr. Baldwin.
No, my name...
Mr. Burns.
I'm terribly busy. What did you say, Mr. Baldwin? - Mr. Burns.
My name is...
I'm busy with Mr. Baldwin. I didn't hear what you said, sir.
My name is... - Mr. Burns...
What is it with you?
I'm Bruce Baldwin.
Can't you see that I'm...
You're Bruce Baldwin!
Well, who is he?
Who are you?
My name's Pete Davis.
Mr. Davis, is this any concern of yours?
From now on, keep your nose out of my affairs.
Don't let it happen again.
I'm terribly sorry about this mistake. This is indeed a pleasure.
That's wrong, isn't it? Bruce... do you mind if I call you Bruce?
We're almost related.
No, not at all.
You see, my wife...
That is, your wife.
Hildy, you led me to expect you were marrying a much older man.
What did I say?
Don't worry about it.
I realize you didn't mean old in years.
Do you always carry an umbrella?
It looked cloudy this morning.
That's right. Rubbers too, I hope.
Thattaboy! A man ought to be prepared.
We'd better run along.
We'd better go.
Where are we going?
I'm taking you two to lunch. Didn't you tell him?
No, she didn't.
I guess she just wanted to surprise you, Bruce.
After you, Hildy.
You're wasting your time.
No, I'm glad to do it.
Hello, Gus.
It's Hildy!
It's none other. How are things?
I can't complain.
I can. I'm hungry. A roast beef sandwich...
Sorry.
...on white bread.
Over there, Bruce.
And you, Hildy?
I'll have the same.
And you, sir?
Yes, that's all right for me.
Bring some mustard too, Gus.
So you two are going to get married?
How does it feel, Bruce?
It feels awful good.
You're getting a great girl.
I realize that.
Things have been different since I met Hildy.
I've never met anyone quite like her.
Everybody else I've ever known you could always tell ahead of time what they would say or do.
But Hildy's not like that. You can't tell that about her.
That's nice.
You're getting something else too: A great newspaperman.
No orchids, Walter.
One of the best I ever knew.
Sorry to see her go. Darn sorry.
I'd like to believe you.
I mean it. If you ever want to come back...
Which I won't.
In spite of everything, there's only one man I'd work for.
I'd kill you if you worked for anybody else.
Hear that?
That's my diploma.
It must be quite a business if it's...
Are you sure you want to quit?
What do you mean?
If there is any doubt about it or if there's anything...
No, this is your chance to have a home and to be, like you said, a human being.
I'll make you take that chance.
Certainly. Why, I wouldn't let her stay.
She deserves all this happiness. All the things I couldn't give her.
All she ever wanted was a home.
I'll certainly try.
I know you will, Bruce.
Where will you live?
Albany.
Got a family up there?
Just my mother.
Just your mother.
You're going to live with her?
Just for the first year.
That will be nice.
Yes, a home with mother, in Albany too.
Mighty nice little town. It's the state capital.
I know. We were there once.
Will you ever forget the night you brought the governor to the hotel?
You see, I was in taking a bath.
Well, I came walking out without...
She didn't know I was in town.
Bruce, how is business up there?
Any better?
Albany's a mighty good insurance town.
Most people take it out pretty early in life.
I can see why they would.
Statistics show that most of...
I've got a feeling I ought to have taken out a little insurance.
That really doesn't matter now that Hildy and I have well, you know, we've...
What do you think?
It might have been a good idea if I had taken out insurance.
I honestly feel that way.
I'm in one business that really helps people.
Of course, we don't help you much while you're alive, but afterward.
That's what counts.
Sure.
I don't get it.
Nice going.
So sorry, Gus. My foot must have slipped.
That's all right. What would you like to drink?
Coffee.
Shall I put some rum in the coffee?
Sure.
Me too, Gus, please.
Not for me.
Go on, Bruce.
I have a lot to do. I have to buy the tickets, check the baggage...
Do it tomorrow.
We're leaving today at four o'clock, taking the sleeper for Albany.
You're leaving today at four o'clock?
That's only two hours.
That's not much time.
I've got a lot to do. I want to...
Isn't that silly? All down over my front.
That's nothing new. Here.
Never mind, I'll get Gus.
Gus, do something about this, will you?
Call me to the telephone when I get back to the table.
Thanks, Gus, that's fine.
I'm terribly sorry about that. That was silly, wasn't it?
Let me get that straight. I must have misunderstood you.
You're taking the sleeper today, then getting married tomorrow?
Well, it's not like that.
What is it like?
Poor Walter. He'll toss and turn all night.
Perhaps we'd better tell him. Mother's coming too.
Your mother kicked the bucket...
No, my mother.
Your mother?
Well, that relieves my mind.
It was cruel to let you suffer so.
Isn't Walter sweet?
Always wanting to protect me.
I admit I wasn't much of a husband, but you can always count on me.
I don't think she'll need you much. I aim to do the protecting myself.
Mr. Burns, telephone.
For me?
That's strange.
Pardon me.
He's not such a bad fellow.
No, he should make some girl real happy.
Slaphappy.
He's not the man for you. I can see that.
But I sort of like him. He's got charm.
He comes by it naturally. His grandfather was a snake.
Hello?
Duffy, listen.
Any way we can stop the 4:00 train to Albany from leaving?
We might dynamite it.
Could we?
Maybe we couldn't.
All right, get this.
Send Sweeney out of town on two weeks' vacation right away.
Keep your shirt on. Hildy's coming back.
She doesn't know it yet, but she's staying.
Tell Louie to stick around the office. I may need him. Goodbye.
Thanks, Gus.
This is bad business.
What's the matter?
The Earl Williams case.
I've been reading about that.
It's pretty bad.
What is the lowdown on it?
Simple, honey.
Poor little dope lost his job, went berserk and shot a cop who was coming to quiet him down.
What a shame.
Your paper has been taking his side.
If he was out of his mind, why doesn't the state just put him away?
Because it was a colored policeman. You know what that means.
The colored vote's important.
Especially with an election in three or four days.
That mayor would hang his grandmother to be reelected.
You could show the man wasn't responsible.
That's not so easy.
Maybe it isn't so hard either.
What do you mean, Hildy?
Doesn't an expert have to examine him before they hang him?
A bird named Egelhoffer is doing it. He'll say the same as the rest.
Suppose he does.
What's your scheme?
Walter, you get the interview with Earl Williams.
Print Egelhoffer's statement.
And right alongside it, double column, run your interview.
Alienist says he's sane. Interview shows he's goofy.
You could save that poor devil's life.
You could...
You're going away.
I forgot.
How long would the interview take?
An hour for the interview. An hour to write it.
We could take the 6 o'clock train if it'd save a man's life.
No, Bruce.
If you want to save Earl Williams' life write it yourself.
You're a good reporter.
I can't write that kind of thing. It takes a woman's touch.
Don't get poetic. Get Sweeney.
He's the best man for that sob-sister stuff.
Poor Sweeney.
Duffy just told me his wife finally had twins.
Isn't that terrible?
Sweeney went out to celebrate and now we can't find him.
So Sweeney has twins and Williams gets hanged.
Now, Walter, look.
Argue with her, or you'll be on a honeymoon with blood on your hands.
How can you be happy after that?
You'll remember that a man went to the gallows because she was too selfish to wait two hours.
Earl Williams' face will come between you tonight and the rest of your life.
Stop it, Walter.
The whole place will hear you.
What an act.
I just remembered Sweeney was only married four months ago.
Hildy, you win. I'm licked.
Then Mrs. Sweeney didn't have twins?
No, indeed. The twins were Walter's, all his.
It was nothing.
Well, come on, let's forget it.
We'll start over again.
I'll offer a business proposition.
Not interested.
You'll be interested.
Don't listen to him.
I know him from way back.
Excuse me, will you?
I'm talking to him.
Now, look, Bruce persuade her and you can write an insurance policy for me.
No, Mr. Burns. I wouldn't use my wife for business purposes.
Wait a minute, Bruce.
How big a policy?
25,000.
Fifty thousand.
What's the commission on a $100,000 policy?
Around $1000, but Hildy...
And what's wrong with $1000?
I couldn't...
We could use that money.
How long would it take to get him examined?
I could get a company doctor here in 20 minutes. - Get him.
Get him.
You keep out of this.
Suppose you have Mr. Burns examined over in his office and see what they'll allow on that old carcass of his.
I'm better than I ever was.
That's nothing to brag about.
I'll go back and change and after you get the check, phone me.
I'll be in the press room at the criminal courts building.
Oh, Walter?
I think you better make that a certified check.
Think I'm a crook?
Yes. No certified check, no story. Get me?
It'll be certified. Want my fingerprints?
No, thanks. I've still got those.
Gus, how much do I owe you?
Thank you, dear.
Oh, I'm sorry.
How much money have you got?
You know, everything we have, $500.
Give me it.
I have to buy the tickets.
I'll buy the tickets.
Believe me, he'll get you in a crap game.
Hildy, I don't gamble.
I know people that never did anything till they met Walter Burns.
But remember, it's everything we have.
I know.
You got change of ten?
See what I mean, don't you, Bruce?
I just gave everything to Hildy. All I've got left...
Come on, Hildy.
Not me. Sign it.
All right.
For the waiter.
Come on, Bruce. Really.
I'll open for a dime.
I'm in.
I'll stay.
Wilcox 3400.
How many?
Two.
Take that, one of you birds. You ain't doing anything, Ernie.
What's the matter with you guys?
Crippled or something?
I'll just bet 20 cents.
Press room. Wait a minute.
Hello, Sarge, McCue talking.
Hold the line, will you? What?
I told you this is the press room of the criminal courts building.
Jake, new lead on the hanging.
This alienist from New York, Dr. Max J. Egelhoffer.
He's interviewing Williams in about half an hour in the sheriff's office.
Must be the tenth alienist they've put on Williams.
If he wasn't crazy, he would be by the time ten of those babies got through psychoanalyzing him.
Is this guy Egelhoffer any good?
You figure it out.
He's the guy they sent to Washington to interview the Brain Trust.
He said they were sane.
Here's the situation on the eve of the hanging.
I'll pick up a little fudge.
This is Murphy.
More slop on the hanging.
A double guard has been thrown around the jail, municipal buildings railroad terminals, and elevated stations to prepare for the expected general uprising of radicals at the hour of execution.
The sheriff has put 200 more relatives on the payroll to protect the city from the Red Army which is leaving Moscow in a couple of minutes.
Trouble is, when the real Red Menace shows up the sheriff will still be crying wolf.
What do you got?
Is that good?
Sure looks good from here.
Hildy, when did you get back?
How are you, Eddie?
Glad to see you.
Glad to see you.
Where'd you get the hat?
I paid 12 bucks for that hat.
Coming back to work?
It's a farewell appearance. I'm going into business for myself.
What doing?
I'm getting married tomorrow.
Again?
Are we invited to the wedding?
I might use you for a bridesmaid, Roy.
How are you, Murphy?
What are you getting married for?
None of your business.
Ain't fooling us, are you?
Fooling?
Look what I've got in here.
Three tickets to Albany on the 6:00 train tonight.
Three?
For me and my beau and, hats off boys, his sweet darling ma.
That's nice.
What kind of marriage is that?
I'm settling down. I'm through with the newspaper business.
Can you picture Hildy singing lullabies and hanging out didies?
Swapping lies over the back fence?
Sour grapes.
She'll get tired beating rugs.
I'm not going to beat any rugs.
That's 3rd and Jefferson. Where the Central School is.
No school this time of day.
What do you care for? You quit.
You said you were through.
I just thought it might be a good fire, that's all.
What's that?
Practicing for the Williams party.
You'll miss a nice hanging.
Not interested.
Tell them to pipe down.
Keep quiet down there!
How do you expect us to get any work done?
Shut up!
Very little respect for the press around here.
Say, did anybody phone me?
Not that I know of.
Say, Hildy, does Walter know you're getting married?
Just had lunch with him.
Does he know you're quitting?
I told him. Any more questions?
Shall I deal you in?
I haven't got time. I have to do a yarn on Williams.
Did he know what he was doing when he fired that gun? If you ask us, no.
If you ask the state alienist, the answer is yes.
Who is he? What's he do?
He was a bookkeeper.
He starts at $20 a week. After 14 years he works himself up to $17.50.
Got more gum?
McClosky Company goes out of business. Williams loses his job.
Can't get another.
I'm in.
So he hangs around the park listening to soapbox spellbinders making speeches, and begins believing them.
And makes some of his own.
Up a dime.
I'm in.
Anything else, Doc? - No, that'll be all, Mr. Burns.
Everything okay?
Nothing to worry about.
Good, good.
How are you doing, Bruce?
Just one more thing.
Good day, Mr. Burns. Mr. Baldwin.
Goodbye, Doc.
Thanks very much.
Who's the beneficiary?
Excuse me?
That is, in case of your death.
Who do we pay the money to?
Why, Hildy, of course.
I don't know. That would make me feel pretty funny.
Now, why shouldn't I make Hildy my whatever-it-was?
I feel I should take care of her.
But you will take care of her, Bruce.
Say, if that doctor is right, I'm good for a long time yet.
Look, Bruce, this is a debt of honor with me.
I was a bad husband to Hildy.
She could have claimed a lot of alimony.
But she wouldn't take any.
She had it coming to her, but she was too independent.
I'm independent too, you know.
I know you are.
But look, you just figure it this way.
I'm good for, we'll say at least 25 years yet.
By then, you'll have made enough so that money won't mean anything to you.
But suppose you haven't made good.
What about Hildy's old age?
Think of Hildy.
I can see her now.
White-haired, lavender and old lace.
Can't you see her, Bruce?
Yes, yes, I can.
She's old, isn't she?
Don't you think that Hildy's entitled to spend her remaining years without worries of money?
Of course you do, Bruce.
Of course, if you put it that way.
And remember, I love her too.
Yes, I'm beginning to realize that.
And the beauty of it is she'll never have to know until I've passed on.
Maybe she'll think kindly of me after I'm gone.
You make me feel like a heel, coming between you.
No, no, Bruce. You didn't come between us.
It was all over for her before you came on the scene.
For me it'll never be.
What do you want?
Can I see you a minute, please?
Excuse me, Bruce.
Did you get it, you get it?
Where is it? Come on.
Certified? - Sure.
But Walter, that's for $2,500.
Here we are certified and everything.
Certified.
I'm afraid Hildy'll feel ashamed to think she hasn't trusted you.
But she'll know some day.
You promised to phone her as soon as you got the check.
Oh, yes, yes, of course.
Get me Hildy Johnson, press room, criminal courts building.
Sit down, Bruce.
The operator will get her for you.
Excuse me, will you?
Yes, I'll wait, thank you.
Start hollering.
Hildegarde.
Thank you.
Hildy Johnson speaking.
Take it easy, will you?
Did you get the check?
Is it certified?
Certified and everything.
I have it right in my pocket.
In your pocket. That's fine.
Wait. Maybe it isn't so fine. Where are you?
Mr. Burns' office.
Is he there?
Look, Bruce. I don't want you to carry that check in your pocket.
Well, because...
Yes, yes, I know all that. But...
There's an old newspaper superstition that the first big check you get, you put in the lining of your hat.
In your hat.
It brings good luck.
I've been a reporter for 20 years. I never heard that.
Neither did I. I know it sounds silly, dear, but do it for me.
Yes, yes, right now.
All right. Just a minute.
There, I've done it.
Anything else?
Oh, yes.
All right.
Yes, I'll tell him. Goodbye.
Everything all right?
Hildy said she'll get right to work.
Fine.
I must be going now.
You don't want to forget this.
It might rain, you know.
Thanks.
You mind if I don't show you out?
I'm so busy in here.
Thanks for everything.
What did you say?
Thanks for everything.
Nonsense. Don't thank me. I should thank you.
So long.
So long.
Hello, Cooley.
What are you doing here?
I want an interview with Earl Williams.
No more interviews.
Why not?
Sheriff's orders. Besides, a doctor's coming over. Can't do it.
Say, is this your money?
I don't think it is.
Twenty bucks?
I guess it is.
That's what I thought.
Come on, I'm in a hurry.
Open up here.
Now, Hildy, don't be...
I won't be long.
Hello, Earl. - Hello.
My name's Johnson. Mind if I talk to you for a few minutes?
No, I haven't anything else to do.
I guess that's right.
So I couldn't plead insanity. I'm just as sane as anybody else.
You didn't mean to kill that policeman?
Of course not. It's against everything I stand for.
They know it was an accident. I'm not guilty.
It's just the world.
I see what you mean.
Sorry about the lipstick, Earl.
Now, look, after you lost your job... - ...what did you do?
I tried to find another job.
I mean, how did you spend your time?
I used to sit around in the park, anyplace. I don't smoke.
When you were in the park, did you hear any speeches?
You mean those fellows that talk too much?
I didn't pay any attention...
Did you hear anything they said?
Yes.
Is there anything in particular you remember?
There was one fellow. - What did he talk about?
He talked about production for use.
Production for use?
Yes, he said everything should be made use of.
Makes sense, doesn't it?
Yes, I liked him.
He was a good speaker.
When you found yourself with that gun in your hand and that policeman coming at you, what did you think about?
I don't know exactly.
Could it have been "production for use"?
I don't know. L...
What's a gun for, Earl?
A gun?
Why, to shoot, of course.
And maybe that's why you used it. - Maybe.
It seems reasonable.
Yes, yes, it is.
I've never had a gun in my hand before.
And that's what a gun's for, isn't it?
Maybe that's why...
Sure, it is.
That's what I thought of. "Production for use".
It's simple, isn't it?
Very simple.
There's nothing crazy about that.
Nothing at all.
Write about that in your paper.
You bet I will. Who sent you the roses?
Miss Mollie Malloy. She's wonderful...
Is that her picture?
Yes. She's beautiful, isn't she?
Time's up, Hildy.
All right.
Guess that's all.
I liked talking to you. Goodbye, Miss Johnson.
Goodbye, Earl.
Good luck.
Three landladies, boys.
Got well, didn't you?
I wonder what the Post will do without Hildy?
You suppose Walter Burns will ever let her go?
Remember when Fenton wanted to go to Hollywood?
Had him thrown in jail for arson.
Forgery.
Was that it?
Yeah, give me some change.
Hey, Mac.
Hey, Stairway Sam.
Would you mind turning on some lights?
It's so dark, you can't see anything.
Who's this guy Hildy's marrying?
I don't know. Bruce something.
I give the marriage six months.
Why?
She won't be able to be away from the paper any longer.
Did you see her when that bell went off?
It must be pretty nice to be able to walk out of a place and quit.
I had a publicity job offered to me last year. I should have taken it.
That's what I'd like, a job on the side.
A desk and a stenographer. I wouldn't mind a nice, big blonde.
With big brown eyes.
I'll bet you ten to one it don't last six months.
She's just like us, or we wouldn't be waiting for that guy to dance.
Miss Mollie Malloy.
Hello, Mollie. How's tricks?
I've been looking for you tramps.
Come to pay a call on Williams?
Nice roses you sent Earl.
What do you want done with them tomorrow?
A lot of wise guys, ain't you?
You're breaking up the game. What do you want?
I came to...
I came to tell you what I think of you. All of you.
Keep your shirt on.
If you was worth breaking my nails on, I'd tear your face open.
What are you sore about?
Wasn't that a swell story we gave you?
You crumbs have been making a fool out of me long enough.
I never said I loved Earl, and was willing to marry him on the gallows.
You made that up.
And about my being his soul mate and having a love nest with him.
You've been around that cuckoo since they threw him in the death house.
That's a lie.
Everybody knows you're his girlfriend.
I met Mr. Williams just once in my life.
When he was wandering in the rain without his hat and coat on like a sick dog, the day before the shooting.
Give me one.
I went up to him like any human being would and asked him what was the matter.
He told me about being fired after being on the job for 14 years.
Who bets?
Bet 20 cents.
I brought him up to my room because it was warm.
Put it on a phonograph.
Listen to me, please.
I tell you he just sat there talking to me all night.
He never once laid a hand on me.
And in the morning he went away and I never saw him again till that day of the trial.
Sure, I was his witness.
And what a witness.
That's why you're persecuting me.
Because Earl treated me decent, and not like an animal.
We're busy.
Go see your boyfriend.
He's got a nice room.
Not for long.
He left a call for 7 a.m.
It's a wonder lightning don't come down and strike you all dead.
What's that?
They're fixing up a pain in the neck for your boyfriend.
Shame on you.
Shame on you!
A poor little fellow that never meant nobody no harm.
Sitting with the angel of death, and you cracking jokes.
You're going to get out of here.
Take your hands off me!
Let's get out of here.
They ain't human. - I know.
They're newspapermen.
All they've been doing is lying.
All they're doing is writing lies.
Why won't they listen to me?
Why won't they listen to me?
Who?
Hildy Johnson?
Hang on. She'll be back in a minute.
You guys want to play any more cards?
What's the use? I can't win anyway.
Gentlemen of the press.
Hildy.
Phone for you.
What?
Where are you?
You're where?
Well, how did that happen?
Never mind, never mind. I'll be right down.
I'm sorry, Pete. Sorry.
Hi, Sheriff. How you doing?
My shin and my back.
What's going on around here?
Bruce was in trouble.
Lioness rushes to defend cub.
Man forgets hankie. Mama goes to wipe nose.
I still give that marriage six months.
I don't know what you fellows are talking about.
What do you want, Pete?
Oh, I got the tickets for the hanging here, boys.
Pete?
What?
Why can't you hang this guy at five o'clock instead of seven?
It won't hurt you, and we can make the city edition.
That's kind of raw, Roy hanging a man in his sleep to please a newspaper.
But you can reprieve him twice so he hangs three days before election.
And you can run on a law-and-order ticket.
I had absolutely nothing to do with those reprieves.
How do we know there won't be another tonight?
What if Egelhoffer finds Williams insane?
He won't find him insane, because he isn't. He's just as sane as I am.
Saner!
Be serious, boys. After all, this is a hanging.
And it's going to go according to schedule.
Seven o'clock in the morning and not a minute earlier.
There's such a thing as being humane, you know.
All right, Pinky. Wait until you want a favor.
And please don't call me Pinky.
Why not?
Because I got a name, see, and it's Peter B. Hartwell.
What's the "B" for? - Bull.
But I'm innocent. I didn't do it. I never stole a watch in my life!
I know you didn't, Bruce. Mike, let him out. I can't.
He's accused of stealing a watch they found on him.
But I never stole...
Please, Bruce.
Who accused him? Diamond Louie, a crook.
I know. It's no good.
You going to let him out or not?
I never stole...
All right, you're not.
Read the Post in the morning.
I can't imagine who'd do a thing like that to me.
I can't think of any enemies.
I'm sure you haven't any...
Have you got the check?
Oh, yes, I have it right here.
That's a funny superstition you newspaper people have.
Yes, isn't it?
About being arrested, I thought maybe Walter Burns might have something to do with it.
But then, of course, I realized he couldn't have. - Why?
He's a very nice fellow.
Oh, yes, I found that out.
What's the matter?
I've lost my wallet. Yes?
Well, Bruce, never mind. I have the money.
Better give me the check too.
And that picture of us in Bermuda.
Don't bother, Bruce. You'll find lots of things missing.
Wait here. I'm not taking any more chances.
I'll be down in three minutes. We'll take the next train.
Sorry.
And so into this little tortured mind came the idea that that gun had been produced for use.
And use it he did.
But the state has a production for use plan too.
It has a gallows.
And at 7 a.m., unless a miracle occurs, that gallows will be used to separate the soul of Earl Williams from his body.
And out of Mollie Malloy's life will go the one kindly soul she ever knew".
That's as far as she got.
But can that girl write an interview?
She'll do till somebody else comes along.
It's not ethical, reading other people's stuff.
Where you get that ethics stuff?
You're the only one who'll swipe any of it.
I say anybody that can write like that won't give it up to sew socks for a guy in the insurance business.
Now I give that marriage 3 months and I'm laying 3-1.
Any takers?
I'll take that bet.
A girl can't leave the room without being discussed by old ladies.
Hello, Post?
Get me Walter Burns, will you, please?
Don't get sore.
We were only saying a reporter like you wouldn't quit so easy.
This is Hildy Johnson.
I can quit all right, without a single quiver.
I'll live like a human being, not like you chumps.
Is that you?
I've got some news for you.
I got the interview, but I've got some more important news.
Better get a pencil and take it down.
All ready?
Now, get this, you double-crossing chimpanzee.
There won't be an interview or a story.
Your check leaves with me in 20 minutes.
I wouldn't cover the burning of Rome for you.
And if I ever lay my eyes on you again I'll hammer on your monkey skull so it rings like a Chinese gong!
You don't know why I'm angry?
Get Louie to tell you about his watch.
And there's just one other little thing.
Hear that?
That's the story I just wrote.
I know we had a bargain. I said I'd write it.
I didn't say I wouldn't tear it up.
It's all in little pieces now.
And I hope to do the same for you someday.
That's my farewell to the newspaper game.
I'll be a woman. Not a news machine.
I'll have babies, give them cod-liver oil and watch their teeth grow.
And if I ever see one of them look at a paper, I'll brain him.
Where's my hat?
Mr. Burns?
Yes, she's still here.
Give me that.
And another thing I want...
Where is my...
There it is.
Hello, Doctor. Sorry to be late.
Quite all right.
These boys from the newspapers take up my time.
They wanted me to hang Williams at their convenience.
Oh, hello, Earl.
These newspapers.
What they did to me in Chicago!
I believe it.
Always after me for interviews.
Me too.
I did promise to make some sort of statement when I finished here.
You don't mind, do you?
It is hardly ethical. All statements are supposed to come from me. I see.
What do you say to giving them some sort of joint interview?
I can discuss some of the psychological aspects of the case and you...
We'd have our pictures taken together?
Shaking hands. - Splendid idea!
I don't take a good picture.
That doesn't matter. Publicity's the thing.
Doctor, I'm getting awful tired.
Can't I go back to jail again?
I'm sorry. I forgot you were there.
No, we've further questions for you.
Sheriff, would you extinguish the lights?
That will help with what we're doing here.
Mr. Williams, you know, of course, that you are going to be executed.
Who do you feel is responsible for that?
I am innocent. It wasn't my fault.
Well, Murph. - Send a post card, kid.
Goodbye.
Au revoir, Hildegarde.
When will we see you again?
Next time you see me, I'll be in a Rolls Royce giving interviews on success.
So long, you wage slaves.
When you're climbing fire escapes, getting kicked out front doors and eating in one-armed joints don't forget your pal, Hildy Johnson.
And when the road beyond unfolds, and the work...
Look out! It's a jailbreak!
What's the matter?
What happened?
Watch where you're aiming, will you?
Watch the gate! He'll try the gate!
Who got away?
Who was it?
Earl Williams!
Who did he say?
Earl Williams!
Hello, hello!
Hurry up, this is important.
Flash!
Earl Williams just escaped.
Jailbreak!
Williams went over the wall!
I don't know anything yet.
Hello, Post?
Give me Walter Burns, quick. Hildy Johnson.
Walter? Walter?
Hildy.
Earl Williams just escaped from the county jail.
Don't worry, I'm on the job.
Hey, Cooley!
Wait!
Hey, wait a minute!
Cooley, I want to talk to you!
This is Endicott. Give me rewrite.
He ain't here.
Hello, Gil?
Here's the situation now. Ready?
Williams was taken to the sheriff's to be examined by Egelhoffer.
In a few minutes, he shot his way out.
Nobody knows where he got the gun.
He got out through the skylight.
He must have slid down the rainpipe.
Nobody knows where he got it.
Or they won't talk.
Give me the desk.
The crime commission offers a $10,000 reward.
No clue yet as to Williams' whereabouts.
Here's a little feature. An accident about a tear bomb.
Yeah, tear bomb, tear bomb. Criminals cry for it.
I don't know.
The tear bomb went off unexpectedly in the hands of the bombing squad.
The following deputies were rushed to the hospital.
A fine friend you are.
Their names are Mervin D. Wilkerson, the mayor's brother-in-law.
After all I've done for you.
Howard Schuster, the sheriff's uncle.
Highlights on Sheriff Hartwell's manhunt.
William Mansfield, his landlord, and Lester Winthrop who married the sheriff's niece.
You remember, the very homely dame? Call you back.
Mrs. William Rice, scrub lady, while scrubbing the eigth floor was shot by one of the sheriff's deputies.
Look, I'm not...
There goes another scrub lady!
It was only a flesh wound. They took her to the hospital.
McCue speaking. Give me the desk.
Any dope on how he escaped?
Maybe the sheriff let him out so he could vote for him.
A man answering the description of Earl Williams boarded a southbound...
Call you back.
I thought you'd gone.
I thought so too.
Get me Walter Burns, quick!
Walter, listen.
I've got the story on how Williams escaped, and I've got it exclusive.
That's right, and it's a pip.
It cost me $450 to tear it out of Cooley.
What's the story?
I'll give it to you. But first I have to tell you I gave him money.
And it wasn't exactly mine.
It's Bruce's money and I want it back.
Bruce's money?
Sure, you'll get it. Now, what's the story?
I'll send the money. I swear it on my mother's grave.
All right. Here's the...
Wait a minute, your mother's alive!
My grandmother's grave. What's the story?
You get that money down here.
All right, here's your story. The jailbreak of your dreams.
This expert, Dr. Egelhoffer, the thinker from New York was giving Williams a sanity test in the sheriff's office.
Sticking a lot of pins in him so he could get his reflexes.
He decided to reenact the crime as it had taken place in order to study Williams' coordination.
I'm coming to it.
He had to have a gun to reenact the crime with.
Who do you suppose supplied it?
Peter B. Hartwell. "B" for brains.
No kidding!
I'm not kidding. I'm not good enough to make this up.
The sheriff gave his gun to the professor who gave it to Earl, who shot the professor in the classified ads.
No, ads.
Ain't it perfect?
If he'd unrolled a red carpet and loaned Williams an umbrella it couldn't have been more ideal.
Who? Oh, no.
Egelhoffer wasn't badly hurt.
They took him to the hospital, where they're afraid he'll recover.
That's great work, Hildy.
Stop worrying about that money. You'll get it in 15 minutes.
I had better. Bruce is waiting in a taxi for me and we're in a hurry.
Hold on a minute.
Vangie, come here.
There's a guy in a taxi in front of criminal courts.
Name's Bruce Baldwin.
What does he look like?
He looks like Ralph Bellamy. - Oh, him?
Can you handle it?
I've never flopped on you yet, have I?
Come on, get going. You only got about two minutes. Hurry.
Sorry to keep you waiting. How much was it again?
$450. Well, just a second.
Louie, come here.
I need $450 worth of counterfeit money.
Can't carry that much, boss.
No, just the $450 counterfeit.
I got that on me.
Quite a coincidence. Take it over to Hildy.
It's coming. I'm sending it with Louie.
Thanks for your story. And good luck on your honeymoon.
No, no, never mind the thanks. Just see that money gets here.
Hildy, you still here?
No, I'm in Niagara Falls.
McCue speaking.
Emil, I got a good feature on the manhunt. Ready?
Mrs. Phoebe DeWolfe, colored, gave birth to a pickaninny in a patrol wagon with Hartwell's rifle squad acting as nurses.
Phoebe was walking along the street when...
That's right.
So they coaxed her into the patrol wagon.
When the pickanninny was born, they checked to see if it was Earl Williams.
They knew he was hiding somewhere.
Here's the payoff. They named the kid Peter Hartwell DeWolfe.
Press room.
Bruce?
I thought you were downstairs in a...
What?
Arrested again.
What for this time?
Well, they called it "mashing".
No, I didn't, Hildy!
I was sitting in the taxi where you left me and the young lady seemed to have a dizzy spell and I just...
She's kind of...
Yes, she's a blonde.
Yes, very blonde.
Never mind. I know how it happened. Just a minute.
Get me Walter Burns. Hildy Johnson.
Bruce, where are you?
Twenty-seventh Precinct?
Hold on a minute.
Walter, you...
He was there a minute ago.
But I want...
I'm sorry, I can't locate him". Why, that double-crossing...
Hello, not you.
Bruce, I can't get there right away.
How about 20 minutes?
I have to wait here for the...
I'll tell you when I see you.
If I ever get my hands on Walter...
Anything I can do to help?
How much money you got?
$1.80.
64 cents.
Welcome to it.
Thanks, you better buy an annuity.
What's that, Emil?
No, I can't give you an official statement.
No, wait a minute. Here's the mayor. How about a statement, Mayor?
Don't pester me now, please.
His Honor won't say anything.
Have you seen Hartwell? - Hard to tell.
There's so many cockroaches around...
Wait a minute. How about a statement?
We go to press in 20 minutes. - I've nothing to say.
Not now.
Just a moment. What do you know about the escape?
Where'd he get the gun?
Not so fast.
About the election...
What effect will this have?
None whatsoever.
How can an unavoidable misfortune like this have any influence on the upright citizens of our fair city?
Mr. Mayor, please, is there a Red Menace or ain't there?
How did Williams get out?
Have you picked out somebody to be responsible?
Any truth in the report you're on Stalin's payroll?
The senator claims you sleep in red underwear.
Never mind the jokes.
Don't forget I'm the mayor and...
Hartwell, I want to see you!
How'd he get away?
Where'd he get the gun?
Any statement on the Red Uprising tomorrow?
Red Uprising?
There will be no Red Uprising.
The governor says the situation calls for the militia.
I say anything the governor says is a tissue of lies.
Here's a red-hot statement from the governor.
He claims the mayor and sheriff have shown themselves to be a couple of eight-year-olds playing with fire.
You can quote him as follows:
It's lucky for the city that next Tuesday is Election Day as the citizens will thus be saved the expense of impeaching the mayor and the sheriff".
That's all. Call you back.
Nice to have seen you, Mayor.
Excuse me, I've got so much to do. - Wait.
Who engineered this getaway?
Was it the Reds?
Was it you? Me?
Just a minute. I'll tell you.
I've got him located.
Williams? - Where?
Out on Center Street.
I just got a tip.
Why didn't you say so?
The rifle squad is going out.
You'll catch him if you hurry.
Look, please...
Pete, I want to talk to you.
I've got so much to do.
See here, Fred...
Pete, you're through. Through?
You mean I'm through?
I'm scratching your name off the ticket and running Sherman in your place.
Reform the Red with a rope"!
Williams isn't a Red and you know it!
But there's Communistic sympathizers and I thought if I got a slogan like that I could...
That's got nothing to do with this case.
There are 200,000 votes at stake. If he don't hang, we'll lose them.
We're going to hang him.
He can't get away.
What do you mean?
He did get away, didn't he?
What do you want?
What do you want?
Are you Sheriff Hartwell?
I'm him. What is it?
You're a hard man to find. I have a message from the governor. - What?
It was a reprieve for Earl Williams.
For who?
Earl Williams.
You said there wasn't going to be a reprieve.
It frightens me to think of what I'd like to do to you.
Who was there? - Nobody.
He was fishing. - Get the governor on the phone.
He's not there.
He's duck shooting.
Blasted nimrod!
Fishing, duck shooting...
A guy who's done nothing for the last 40 years gets elected governor and he's a Tarzan.
Read that. "Insane".
He knows very well Williams isn't insane.
I never met the man.
Pure politics.
It's an attempt to ruin us.
What do we tell the reporters?
Tell them the party is through on account of you.
As an afterthought, tell them I want your resignation now.
Hello.
Yes, yes, this is Hartwell.
What? Where?
Holy Moses!
Hold the wire!
They've got Williams!
The rifle squad has him at his house.
Tell them to hold the phone.
Hold the wire.
Cover up that transmitter.
No. Now, listen.
You never arrived with this. Yes, I did.
I came through that door...
How much do you make?
I thought he was sheriff...
What's your salary?
$40 a week.
How'd you like to make $350 a month?
That's almost $100 a week.
I couldn't afford that. Who? Me?
They need a fellow like you in the city sealer's office.
The what?
City sealer's.
You mean I should work in the sealer's...
My wife wouldn't like that.
She lives in the country with my family.
That's all right. Bring her in. We'll pay all the expenses.
I don't think so.
Why not?
I got two kids in school. If they change towns, they'll lose a grade... No.
They'll skip a grade.
And I guarantee you that they'll graduate...
Hold your horses, Olsen. Hurry up, Fred.
Now, what do you say?
That puts me in a peculiar hole.
No, it doesn't.
You never delivered this.
You got caught in traffic or something.
No, I came... - Pretend you didn't.
Now get out and don't let anybody see you.
But how do I know... - Come to my office tomorrow.
What's your name?
Pettibone. - Pettibone?
Not really.
Lay low and keep your mouth shut.
I'm tired anyhow.
Go to this address.
Nice homey place.
They'll take care of you. Tell them Fred sent you.
Here's $50 on account.
Wait, I'll tell you in one minute.
You forgot to tell me what a city sealer does.
Is it hard?
Easy.
Very easy.
Good, because my health isn't what my wife...
We'll fix that too.
My wife?
Yes, fix anything. Go ahead.
They're still on the phone.
Tell them to shoot to kill.
But the reprieve!
Go ahead and do as I tell you.
Hello, Olsen.
Shoot to kill. That's the orders. Pass the word along.
$500 reward.
$500 for the man who does it.
I'll be right over.
Hi, Hildy.
You double-crossing hyena.
What'd you pull on Mr. Baldwin this time? - Who, me?
You and that albino of yours.
Evangeline's no albino.
She'll do, till one comes along.
She was born in this country.
If she tries anything else, she'll have to stay in this country.
Did you bring that money?
Oh, yeah, $400.
$450.
All right, you can't blame a guy for trying.
Give me a receipt.
I'll give you a scar.
You got plenty of them.
I'll take Mr. Baldwin's wallet too.
Mr. Baldwin's what?
His purse. Come on, Louie.
All right, Hildy.
I'll do it for you because I like you.
But tell your financier to be more careful, know what I mean?
I'll loan him a pair of your brass knuckles.
Don't talk that way. I'll take that.
I'll take it to the station.
Wait a minute!
Take it to the 27th Precinct and tell the cops how this happened. I couldn't do that.
Burns would turn me in.
Not a bad idea.
Here, catch!
Louie!
Hello, operator.
Hildy Johnson. Will you get me...
Drop that phone!
Never mind.
You won't tell anybody where I am.
Put that gun down, Earl.
You don't want to shoot me.
I'm your friend, remember?
I'm writing the story on you of production for use.
That's right. Production for use.
You don't want to hurt your... Don't move!
Maybe you're my friend, maybe not.
But don't come nearer.
You can't trust anybody in this crazy world.
I don't blame you. I wouldn't trust anybody either.
Don't do that. Put it back.
Put it back.
If you try any tricks, I'll shoot you. I can do it right from here.
Sure you could, Earl. But you don't want to do that.
You don't want to kill anybody.
No, you're right. I don't want to kill anybody.
That's what I thought. - Wait a minute.
Where are you going?
I was going to close the door so nobody'd see you.
No, you weren't. You were going to get somebody.
But I don't want that. All I want is to be left alone.
I won't get anybody.
You will.
You'll get them after me again. I won't let you do that. I won't...
Give me that.
I guess I fired all the shells.
I'm awful tired. - That shot.
They'll know you're here.
I don't care.
I'm not afraid to die.
I told the guy that when he handed me the gun.
Quiet!
Waking me in the middle of the night.
Talking about things they don't understand.
Shut up.
I wish they'd take me back and hang me.
They will if you don't keep quiet.
I couldn't go through another day like this.
You think I could?
Get me Walter Burns, quick. Tell him I need him.
Bruce, I know I said I'd be down, but something terrific has happened.
Walter, come right away.
Wait, Bruce, I'll explain.
I've got Earl Williams here, in the press room. On the level.
Hurry, I need you!
Bruce, I've captured Earl Williams. You know, the murderer.
Stay there, Earl. Wait.
Bruce, I'll be down.
As soon as I hand him to the paper.
Bruce, I can't. Don't you realize...
Who is it?
Me, Mollie Malloy. Open the door!
What do you want, Mollie?
I got to find...
Where is everybody?
They've gone.
Please tell me where.
I don't know, and I'm awfully busy.
They got him surrounded. They'll shoot him down like a dog.
They're looking for you too.
I don't care. Tell me.
I ain't afraid of them.
All right, they're down at Center Street and Fourth.
Oh, that's where I used to...
Mollie, Mollie, don't go.
Come in, Mollie. Draw up a chair.
Hello. - How did you get in here?
Down the pipe.
I didn't mean to shoot him. Really, I didn't.
Be quiet.
You believe me, don't you?
Sure, I believe you.
Thanks for the roses. They were beautiful.
That's all right, Mr. Williams.
Don't cry.
Don't you get hysterical.
I want to get him out.
You wouldn't get down that hall.
But they'll find him.
I know.
I'm trying to think before those reporters come back.
Let them take me. What's the difference?
I'll never let them.
Who locked the door?
Now it's too late.
It isn't. Get in this desk.
Oh, what's the use?
Come on, get in.
We'll get you out in ten minutes.
Pull yourself together.
All right, here.
Sit down.
All right, all right, I'm coming!
Don't kick the building down.
We got phone calls to make.
What's she doing up here?
What's the matter?
Came up here and had hysterics.
How do you feel, kid?
Not so good.
Get you some water?
Do anything for you?
You don't look so sick.
Did you bump into Williams?
Funny!
Where is he? - Let me alone.
Okay.
Give me the desk.
No harm in asking. Hello, Jim.
Yes, false alarm.
They surrounded the house, all right but Williams wasn't there.
The Halloween outside has the police standing on its ear.
I thought you were gone.
I'm waiting for money from Walter.
What a chase! Give me Emil.
Give me the desk.
Any news, boys?
Yeah, I never been so tired in my life. What?
Where?
Melrose Station?
All right, connect me. Hello, Mollie. How are you?
Hold it a minute. This looks good.
An old lady claims Williams is hiding under her piazza.
Tell her to stand up.
You want to go out on it?
I'll cover this end.
I spent $1.40 on taxicabs already.
No more going out.
Never mind, Sarge.
Who pulled the shades down?
They were throwing those lights around.
You know, I've got a hunch Williams ain't anywhere they've been looking for him.
He might be here in this building.
Sure, sure, hanging around like a duck in a shooting gallery.
From the skylight, but how did he reach the ground?
I'm pretending there ain't any Earl.
He could have jumped to this roof.
From the roof he could slide down the drainpipe.
And come in any of these windows.
If the story walks in the window...
Masterminds. Why don't you go home? Maybe Williams will call on you.
It'd be funny if he was in this building.
Why not search the building?
I am not wandering all over.
A great bunch of reporters you are.
Too lazy to go after the biggest story in years.
You seem pretty anxious to get rid of us.
Are you trying to scoop us? - Are you crazy?
On my time?
Maybe Mollie's been giving her the truth on how Williams got the gun.
I didn't do nothing.
Come clean.
Let the girl alone. She's...
Well?
Mrs. Baldwin. Mother.
Don't "mother" me.
Playing cat and mouse and keeping my boy locked up.
Making us miss two trains, and you supposed to be married tomorrow.
I'll be with you in five minutes...
Just give me Bruce's money.
You can stay here forever, you and that murderer you caught.
Murderer?
Which one of these men is it?
They all look like murderers.
What murderer did you catch?
I never said any such thing.
I'm quoting my son. He has never lied to me.
Somebody's lying.
I never said anything like that.
Yes, you did.
I said I was trying to find the murderer.
Quit stalling.
She's got it balled up.
Who are you holding out on?
Nobody.
Now let me go, will you?
Stop it, stop it!
She don't know where he is.
I'm the only one that knows.
Where's Williams? - Try and find out.
Come on, talk.
Now you want me to talk? - Talk.
Ain't that funny?
You wouldn't listen to me before, and now you want me to talk.
Don't say anything.
I know what I'm doing. - Stay out of this.
Why didn't you listen to me?
Cut that out.
Hands off!
Where is he?
Why do you want to know?
So you can write more lies to sell papers?
Never mind that.
All right. I'll give you a story.
A wonderful story!
Only this time it'll be true. You'll never find me now!
Get the ambulance, somebody!
Get an ambulance, somebody!
She's dead.
No, she isn't killed, she's moving!
Did you see that?
She jumped.
I know that.
Where have you got Williams? Hidden.
He's in the desk.
She didn't kill herself.
How're you doing? - Let me out.
Quiet.
You're sitting pretty.
What's in there?
Who are you?
This is Bruce's mother.
What are you doing?
Shut up!
You're doing something wrong.
Mother, please.
Take her out of here.
Take the lady to Polack Mike's.
My name's Louie Peluso.
See that she doesn't talk to anyone.
Tell them it's a case of D.T.'s.
Don't worry, Mother. It's only temporary.
Let go of me.
Where are you going?
To get Bruce out of jail.
Why did you do this to me?
Get Bruce out of jail?
How can you worry about a man who's resting in a police station? - This is war!
You can't desert me.
Get off that trapeze.
You've got your story.
Earl Williams captured by the Morning Post".
I covered your story for you, now I'm getting out.
You drooling idiot, there are 365 days in a year one can get married.
How many times you got a murderer locked up in a desk?
You got the whole city by the seat of the pants.
You've got the brain of a pancake.
This isn't just a story. It's a revolution.
The greatest yarn since Livingston discovered Stanley.
The other way around.
Don't get technical at such a time.
You've taken a city that's been graft-ridden for 40 years and given us a chance to have the same kind of government New York has under La Guardia.
If I didn't have your best interest at heart, I wouldn't argue with you.
You've done something big. You've stepped up into a new class.
We'll make such monkeys of those ward healers nobody'll vote for them. - Expose them?
We'll crucify that mob.
We'll keep Williams under cover, until we can break the story then share the glory with the governor.
I get it, I get it.
You'll kick over City Hall.
You got the mayor and Hartwell backed up against the wall.
This isn't just a newspaper story. It's a career!
And you bellyache about catching the eight or nine o'clock train.
But I never figured it that way.
Because you're a doll-faced hick.
They'll be naming streets after you. There'll be statues of you.
The movies will be after you. There'll be a Hildy Johnson cigar.
I can see the billboards now:
Light up with Hildy Johnson..."
We got a lot to do.
Now you're talking.
We can't leave Williams here.
We'll take him to my private office.
How are you going to take him?
We'll carry the desk over.
It's crawling with cops outside.
We'll lower it out the window with pulleys.
Start pounding out a lead!
How much of this stuff do you want?
All you the words you got.
Can I call the mayor a bird of prey?
Call him anything you like.
Give him the works.
Hello, Duffy?
We got the biggest story in years.
Earl Williams captured by the Morning Post. Exclusive!"
Tear out the whole front page.
The whole front page. Out!
And never mind the European war. We got something bigger than that.
Hildy Johnson's writing the lead.
And get hold of Butch O'Connor.
Tell him to come up here with his wrestlers.
Yeah, Butch O'Connor. What?
I've got a desk I want moved...
What the deuce do you want?
Hello, Bruce. - Hildy.
Never mind the Chinese earthquake.
I just want to ask you...
How'd you get out of jail?
Not through any help of yours.
I'm not talking to you.
I had to wire Albany for $100 so I could get out on bail.
What will they think in Albany?
The money went to the police station.
We're waiting for that story.
We'll explain everything to them.
Where's mother?
She left.
I can't hear you.
Where'd she go?
Out someplace.
Junk the Polish Corridor!
Tell me where my mother was going. - She couldn't say.
This is more important.
Did she get the money?
She left in a hurry.
I'll take that money.
In my purse. I can handle things.
I'll take that certified check too.
I'll give you the tickets. You'll find your money in the wallet.
My wallet?
This is my wallet.
Say, there's something funny going on... What are you doing?
Just wanted to look at it.
Hildy, I'm taking...
I'm taking the 9 o'clock train.
Sure, sure.
Did you hear what I said?
I said I am taking the 9 o'clock...
Oh, Bruce, I put it in here!
Let her alone, will you, buddy.
Do me a favor...
Just answer one question.
You don't want to come with me, do you?
Answer me.
You don't, do you? No.
Take the Miss America pictures off page six.
Hildy, tell me. Tell me the truth.
Wait a minute.
Now look here, my good man...
You shut up, Burns.
You're doing all this to her.
She wanted to get away from you.
But you caught her and changed her mind...
Stick Hitler on the funny page. Now let me ask you...
Will you give up everything for a man like him?
No, but something's happened. I'll tell you...
Tell him nothing. He's a spy, you fool. - I am not a spy.
Ridiculous.
You're coming with me right now.
Just a second. This is the biggest thing in my life. I see.
I'll keep.
I'm like something in the icebox.
You just don't love me.
That isn't true. Just because you won't listen you say I don't love you.
You never intended to be decent and live like a human being.
All right, if that's what you want to think.
I'm trying to concentrate.
You're just like him and all the rest.
Sure. That's what I am.
What?
Leave the rooster story alone. That's human interest.
If you had any sympathy or understanding...
I understand, all right...
Wait a minute.
There's one question I want to know.
The mayor's first wife's name.
The one with the wart on her?
Fanny. What, Duffy?
You never loved me at all. Never mind.
You don't work for advertising.
If you change your mind, I'm on the 9 o'clock train.
If you want me, take me as I am. Don't try to change me.
I'm no suburban bridge player. I'm a newspaperman.
That's it. Keep it coming as fast as you can.
Get back in there, you mock turtle.
You tell Butch it's a matter of life and death? Good.
Butch's on his way. We just have to hold out for 15 minutes.
The boys will be back to phone.
I'll handle them.
God, now the moon's out.
Three taps is me. Don't forget.
Got enough air?
Not very much.
That better?
You're sitting pretty.
How's it coming? - All right.
Where's Bruce? - He went out.
Is he coming back here?
Certainly.
Didn't you hear him?
What have you got so far?
While Hartwell's paid gunmen stalked the city, shooting bystanders spreading terror, Williams was lurking..."
Wait a minute.
Aren't you going to mention the Post? - I did.
Second paragraph.
Who reads the second paragraph?
How long have I been telling you how to write a story?
I'm sorry.
What's the idea of locking this door?
Who's that?
Bensinger.
That's his desk.
Open the door, will you?
What's his name?
Bensinger, of the Tribune.
The Tribune? - Who's in there?
Haven't you any better sense...? Hello.
Hello, Mr. Burns.
Quite an honor having you come over here.
Hello, Bensinger.
You know my...
I just want to get my...
It's quite a coincidence seeing you tonight, isn't it?
How do you mean?
I was talking to our Mr. Duffy about you this afternoon.
Really?
Nothing detrimental, I hope.
On the contrary. On the contrary.
That was one swell story you had in the paper this morning.
Did you care for the poem, Mr. Burns?
The poem?
The poem was great.
I liked the ending especially.
And all is well outside his cell but in his heart he hears the hangman calling the gallows falling and his white-haired mother's tears".
Heartbreaking?
That's fine.
Would you like to work for me?
We can use a man like you.
All we got are lowbrows like Johnson here.
Are you serious, Mr. Burns?
Serious? Wait a minute.
Duffy, I'm sending Mr. Bunsinger over to see you. - Bensinger.
Mervyn, isn't it?
Yeah... No. Roy.
Certainly.
Roy V. Bensinger, the poet.
You wouldn't know.
You probably never heard of Shakespeare either.
Put Mr. Bensinger on staff. How much you getting on the Tribune? - $75.
I'll give you $100 and a byline.
Now you give him everything he wants, you understand?
Roy, write me a story from the point of view of the escaped man.
He hides, afraid of every sound, every light.
He hears footsteps, they're closing in.
Get the sense of the animal at bay.
Sort of Jack London style?
I'll get my rhyming dictionary.
It doesn't have to rhyme.
I'm deeply grateful, Mr. Burns.
If there's an opening for a war correspondent I parler a little French.
I'll keep you in mind.
Au revoir, mon capitain.
Bonjour.
His white-haired mother's tears". That's the tops.
Listen, that fellow Bensinger is on his way right now.
Handle him with kid gloves. Have him write poetry.
We don't want him. Stall him until the extra's out.
Say his poetry smells and kick him downstairs.
Double-crosser. - That'll teach him.
He won't quit his paper without giving notice after this.
I mean you. - Me?
You'd double-cross anybody...
Wait a minute.
Bruce isn't coming back.
He said he was taking the 9:00 train.
In that case, he's gone by now.
Don't sit there like a frozen robin. Get on with the story.
We ought to be finished when Butch gets here.
How you have messed up my life. What am I going to do?
Window's too small. We'll carry the desk out.
I'd be on that train right now. I'm a sap, falling for your line.
They'll name streets after me...
Yes, well, get back to work.
I'm not going back to work. Walter, what...?
Who is it? - It's me, boss.
It's Louie.
Louie.
What's the matter?
Where's Mrs. Baldwin?
What happened?
Down Western Avenue, we was going 65 miles an hour, know what I mean?
Where's the old lady?
We run smack into a police patrol.
Busted it in half.
Was she hurt?
Can you imagine bumping into a load of cops?
What did you do with her?
Search me, when I come to...
You were with her. You were in the cab.
The driver got knocked cold.
Butterfingers!
You handed her over to the cops. - What do you mean?
They was on the wrong side of the street.
Now she's probably squawking to the police.
She's not squawking much. Know what I mean?
Don't tell me...
Was she killed? Was she?
Did you notice?
Me with a gun on the hip and a kidnapped lady on my hands I'm going to ask questions from cops?
You know what I mean?
Dead, dead. This is the end!
It's fate.
What will be will be.
What am I going to say to Bruce?
What can I tell him?
If he loves you, you won't have to tell him anything.
Would you rather have had the old dame drag the police in here? I killed her.
I'm responsible.
What am I going to do?
How can I ever face Bruce again?
Look at me, Hildy.
I am looking at you, you murderer.
If it was my own grandmother, I'd carry on.
You know I would, for the paper.
Louie, where'd it happen?
Western and 34th.
I got to get out of here...
We can do more here. Be calm.
Listen...
Hello, hello.
Maine 4557. Who?
Butch, where are you?
Mission Hospital?
Receiving room.
What are you doing there?
Was an old lady brought in from a smashup?
For H. Sebastian, Butch, it's a matter of life and death.
Nobody? - I can't hear.
Morningside 2469.
Speak up. A what?
You can't stop for a dame now!
I don't care if you've been after her.
Our lives are at stake!
Are you going to let a woman come between us?
Was there an old lady brought in in an auto smashup?
Butch, I'd put my arm in fire for you up to here.
You can't double-cross me.
Look around, please.
All right, put her on. I'll talk to her.
Good evening, madam.
Now, listen, you ten-cent glamour girl you can't keep Butch from his duty.
What's that?
You say that again, I'll kick you in the teeth!
Say, what kind of language is that?
Now, look here, you...
She hung up. What did I say?
Duffy, how do you like that?
Mousing around with some big...
Will you shut up? I'm trying to hear!
Duffy!
That's cooperation.
Well, where is Duffy?
Diabetes.
I ought to know better than to hire anybody with a disease.
Give me Olympia 2136, will you?
Yes, boss. - Louie, it's up to you.
Anything you say, boss.
Get a hold of some guys.
Anybody with hair on his chest, get them off the street.
We got to get that desk out.
Is it important?
You're the best friend I got. - I like you too.
Then don't fail me.
Get enough people to move that desk.
You know me. Shirt off my back.
Okay, don't bump into anything.
Dumb immigrant is sure to flop on me.
Try the hospital again.
If he's not back in five, we'll carry it alone.
Do anything you want.
There's a million ways.
We can have firemen take it out. - I don't care what you do.
Come here.
See if we can lift it.
What?
Nobody? Never mind.
Are you going to help me?
No!
I'll strain my back.
I'll find Mrs. Baldwin.
Don't open that door!
I'll go to the morgue...
We want to talk to you a minute.
Let go. What's the idea?
Get your hands off me!
Now look here, Johnson...
Hey, you!
You mean me?
Yes, you. What do you mean by breaking in here like this?
Don't bluff me. I don't care what paper you're editor of. Let go of me.
Something's happened to my mother-in-law.
We know what you are up to.
She and Mollie were in here talking.
I don't know anything. And there's been an accident.
There's something very peculiar going on here.
Now see here... - Just a moment, Hartwell.
Make your accusations in the proper manner.
Otherwise, I'll have to ask you to get out.
Ask me to what?
Get out.
You will, eh?
Don't let anybody in or out.
We'll see about this.
Give him the third degree.
Make them talk and you got Williams.
I'm going to get to the bottom of this. Are you going to talk?
What do you want me to say?
What do you know about Williams?
There.
Now we're getting some...
Take her away. I got ways to make her talk.
Don't you dare touch me or...
She got a gun! - Grab it!
No, you don't.
Walter!
All right, Burns. I'll take that gun.
Where did you get this?
I can carry a gun.
Not this gun.
I can explain it.
She was interviewing Williams, so I gave her a gun to defend herself.
Interesting. But this is the gun that Williams shot his way out with.
My good man, are you trying to make me out a liar?
I ought to know my own gun, oughtn't I...?
So that's where Williams got it.
She got it from him.
Where's Williams? - Where is he?
You're barking up the wrong tree.
Tell me where he is.
At the hospital calling on Professor Egelhoffer with marshmallows.
Where is he?
Ask the mastermind why he's here.
What do you know about this?
My dear fellow the Morning Post doesn't obstruct justice or hide criminals.
You ought to know that.
You're under arrest.
You too.
Who's under arrest?
Listen, you square-toed, pimple-headed spy do you realize what you're doing?
I'll show you.
You and the Post are obstructing justice.
I'll see that you're fined $10,000.
You'll see nothing.
I'll begin by impounding the Post's property.
Is this your desk?
What are you afraid of, Hildy?
I dare you to move this desk.
Go ahead, try it. - I will.
I warn you, you move this desk out of here, I'll put you behind bars.
He can do it too.
I'll see Roosevelt hears about it.
Tell him. Come on, boys!
Confiscate this desk.
This is your last chance.
This is a federal offense.
We'll take a chance.
All right.
Open up this door!
Mother! I'm glad to see you... - That's the man that did it.
There.
What's the idea here?
She claims she's been kidnapped.
They dragged me down all the way down the stairs and...
Did he do it?
He was in charge. He told them to kidnap me.
Excuse me, madam. Are you referring to me?
You know you did.
What about this? Kidnapping, huh?
Trying to frame me, huh?
I never saw her before in my life.
What a thing to say!
I was here when that girl jumped out the window.
Get the mayor over here.
Look, madam, be honest.
If you were out joyriding plastered, or got into a scrape, why don't you admit it instead of accusing innocent people?
You ruffian!
How dare you talk like that to me!
He's just crazy, Mother.
I'll tell more. I could tell you why they did it.
They were hiding some kind of murderer in here...
Hiding him? In here?
Madam, you're a cockeyed liar and you know it!
What's that? - He's in there!
Give me the desk.
What a break! - Stand back.
He might shoot.
Guns out.
He's harmless.
Don't take any chances.
He can't hurt anybody, you've got his gun.
Go on, you gray-haired old weasel.
Let me out of here!
Mother!
I was looking all over for you. What happened?
Jake, hang on.
Hildy, call Duffy. - No!
You want to see us scooped?
Aim right for the center.
That's murder.
Okay, one of you get on each end of the desk.
It's coming up. - You're covered.
In a minute.
Don't move.
Any time now.
I'll count three.
It's hot.
Ready?
Any second now.
Three.
I got you, Williams.
Go ahead, shoot me. - Come out.
Earl Williams was just captured in the criminal courts building.
On your feet.
Don't try any funny stuff.
Williams was unconscious.
The police overpowered him.
He offered no resistance.
His gun wouldn't work.
The Post turned Williams over to the sheriff.
Put the cuffs on them.
More later.
An anonymous note led to Williams' capture. Hold on.
The sheriff's tracing a call that gave away Williams' hiding place.
Where's the old lady? - She went out.
Call you back.
Give me the warden's office.
You'll wish you'd never been born.
Will I?
Hello, Fred.
Well, fine work, Pete.
You delivered the goods. - Looks natural, don't it?
Sight for sore eyes.
Aiding a criminal.
And a little charge of kidnapping...
But that's the jail.
Looks like about ten years apiece for you two birds.
When you think you've licked the Post, it's time to get out.
Whistling in the dark won't help. You're through.
Archie Leach said that to me a week before he cut his throat.
Is that so?
We've been in worse jams than this, haven't we, Hildy?
You forget the power that watches over the Post.
It's not with you now.
Says you.
I've caught him. Yes, Williams. Single-handed.
Proceed to the hanging, per schedule.
You'll be in office exactly two days more.
We'll pull your nose out of that feedbag.
I tell you what you'll be doing.
Making brooms in the penitentiary. Joe?
This is Hartwell.
Come to my office right away.
I captured a couple of important birds. Take their confessions.
Get Liebowitz.
The lawyers won't help you now.
You're talking to the Morning Post.
The power of the press?
Bigger men than you have found out what the power of the press is.
Presidents, kings...
Here's the reprieve.
Get out.
You can't bribe me. My wife...
Get out.
No, I won't. Here's the reprieve.
What?
I don't want to be a city sealer. - Throw him out.
Out you go.
Wait.
Who's trying to bribe you?
They wouldn't take it. - Insane!
What did I say?
An unseen power.
What do you mean with a story like that?
He's an imposter.
Trying to hang an innocent man to win an election, eh?
That's murder.
I never saw him before.
Lf I was to...
What's your name?
Pettibone.
When did you deliver this first?
Who'd you talk to?
They started to bribe me. - They?
Those.
Them. - It's absurd on the face of it.
He's talking like a child.
Out of the mouths of babes.
Hi, babe.
He's insane or drunk.
If Williams has been reprieved, I'm tickled to death. Aren't you?
You'd hang your mother to be reelected.
That's a horrible thing to say about anybody.
You're marvelous. Take a look at that.
You're an intelligent man. - Never mind.
Let's have your story.
Nineteen years ago, I married Mrs... - Skip all that.
She wasn't Mrs. Pettibone then.
She was one of the...
This document is authentic. Williams has been reprieved.
Our commonwealth has been saved the necessity of shedding blood.
Get off the soapbox. Save that for the Tribune.
Take those handcuffs off my friends.
I'm amazed at you. - Isn't he awful?
You don't know how badly I feel.
No excuse at all for Pete.
I was only doing my duty. - That's all right.
What'd you say your name was?
Pettibone.
Here's a picture of my wife. - Fine-looking woman.
You haven't seen her yet.
She's all right.
She's good enough for me. If I was to tell...
I understand perfectly, and as long as I am mayor...
Which ought to be about Three more hours.
Enough to get out a special edition asking for your recall.
And your arrest. You boys ought to get about ten years apiece.
Don't make any hasty decisions. You might run into a libel suit.
You'll run into the governor.
We understand each other perfectly.
Yes, and so do I.
So do you what?
And now, Mr. Pettibone we'll deliver this reprieve to the warden's office.
Come along.
Lf I was to tell my wife...
You won't have to.
Wait till they read the Morning Post tomorrow.
Tight squeeze.
Give me Duffy.
That's the worst jam. What?
Where?
Get him.
Remember stealing Old Lady Haggerty's stomach off the coroner?
Anytime you need this guy he's never there.
We proved she'd been poisoned, didn't we?
We had to hide out for a week.
Do you remember that?
The Shoreland Hotel. That's how we happened to...
We could have gone to jail for that too.
Yes, maybe you're right, Hildy. It's a bad business.
You'll be better off.
You better get going.
Where would I go?
To Bruce, of course.
You know he's gone. He took a train.
Send a wire.
He'll be waiting at the station when you get into Albany.
Why doesn't he have a phone?
I don't know. I got us messed up...
Get going, Hildy.
What is that with you?
Wait a minute.
Can't you understand?
I'm trying to do something noble.
Get out before I change my mind.
It's tough enough now.
Just a minute.
Send him a wire.
He'll be waiting.
Who'll write the story? - I will.
It won't be as good... It's my story.
I like to think that it... - At last.
I get it.
The same old act, isn't it?
Try to push me out, thinking I'll want to stay.
I know I deserve that. Wait a minute, Duffy.
This time you're wrong.
When you walk out that door, part of me will go right with you.
But a whole new world will open up for you.
I made fun of Bruce and Albany. You know why? - Why?
I was jealous.
I was sore because he could offer you the kind of life I can't give you.
That's what you want, honey.
I could do the story and take the train...
Forget it. Come on. Come on.
Goodbye, dear, and good luck.
Duffy, now this is how it goes so far...
Just a minute.
Hello. Who?
Hildy Johnson?
She just left. - I'm still here.
I can take it.
Hang on a minute.
Hildy Johnson speaking.
The Fourth Precinct Police Station?
Put him on.
I thought you were on your way to Albany...
What for?
For having counterfeit money.
Counterfeit money?
Hold on a minute.
Where did you get it?
I gave it to you?
All right. I'll try and do something about it.
Honey.
Honey, don't cry, please.
I didn't mean to make you cry. What's wrong? You never cried before.
I thought you were really sending me away with Bruce.
I didn't know you had him locked up.
I thought you were on the level, for once.
That you were just standing by and letting me go off with him and not doing a thing about it.
Come on, honey. What did you think I was, a chump?
I thought you didn't love me.
What were you thinking with?
I don't know.
What are you standing there gawking for?
We have to get him out of jail.
Send Louie down with some honest money and send him back to Albany.
Sure.
Everything's changed. We're coming over to the office.
Don't worry about the story. Hildy will write it.
She never intended to quit.
We're getting married.
Can we go on a honeymoon this time?
Sure.
Duffy, you can be managing editor.
Not permanently. Just for the two weeks we're away.
I don't know where.
Where are we going?
Niagara Falls.
Niagara Falls. - Two whole weeks?
Sure, you've earned it.
What?
What? A strike?
What strike?
Where?
Albany?
I know it's on the way, but...
Okay, we'll honeymoon in Albany.
Okay, Duffy.
Isn't that a coincidence! I wonder if Bruce can put us up.
Say, why don't you carry that in your hand?
Tracy!
Tracy!
Tracy!
Tracy!
Tracy!
How do you spell "omelet"?
Oh, you.
Ninety-four for the ceremony and 506 for the reception.
I don't know where we'll put them all if it should rain.
Oh, it won't rain. Tracy won't stand for it.
Mother, how do you spell "omelet"?
O-M-M-E-L-E-T.
I thought there was another L.
Funny wedding present, an omelet.
It was a dish, dear, a silver dish.
Bring some of that junk off the table.
Mother, be an angel and get these out of the way.
Yes, darling.
This stinks.
Don't say "stinks," darling. If necessary, "smells."
But only if necessary.
These cards have been changed again.
There must be a ghost in the house. Maybe the ghost of groom number one.
Don't talk about Dexter as though he were dead.
Might as well be for all Tracy cares.
Right.
Oh, I wouldn't say that.
If I never see Dexter Haven again, I'll...
Isn't that awful?
Friends of your father's.
Wouldn't you know it?
What are they, tap dancers or musical-comedy producers?
Hardly fair to your father's interest in art.
Art, my eye.
The art of putting up $ 100,000 to display the shapely legs...
That will do, Tracy.
Oh, I give up.
If you'd just face the facts squarely, as I did...
We might face the fact that neither of us has proved to be a success as a wife.
We just picked the wrong first husbands, that's all.
Don't argue about it. You wanted me to take a stand. I've taken it.
It's the only stand a woman could take and keep her self-respect.
Yes, dear, I know.
Now I have my self-respect and no husband.
You almost talk as though you wanted him back.
He wouldn't come back, probably.
Hey, it's better this way. Really. You'll see.
Let's forget about the past. We both deserve happiness now, especially you.
Darling.
Isn't George an angel?
George is an angel.
Is he handsome or not?
George is handsome.
I like Dexter.
Really?
Why don't you postpone the wedding?
How?
Get smallpox.
Don't put the idea in her head.
George isn't usually late.
He's waiting at the stables.
Waiting...
If I don't choke her before Saturday...
It'd postpone it.
It would not. Be in the car when I get down.
She's so mean about Dexter.
He was rather mean to her.
Did he really sock her?
Please, Dinah.
Did he, really?
Darling, you go wait in the car.
Well, the papers were full of "innundo."
Of what?
Of innundo.
Cruelty and drunkenness, it said.
Mother, why won't Tracy ask her own father to the wedding?
Your sister has definite opinions about things.
She's sort of...
Well, you know hard, isn't she?
Tracy sets exceptionally high standards for herself, that's all and other people aren't always quite apt to live up to them.
But don't you think it's stinking not at least to want Father?
Yes, darling. Between ourselves, I think it's good and stinking.
Oh, I wish something would happen.
Nothing ever possibly in the least ever happens here.
Mother.
How do you get smallpox?
Oh, Dinah, please go. Go.
This is Uncle Willie's favorite. Complete Surrender.
Where'd you get this idiotic thing, anyway?
Hey!
Never play with fire, particularly on the eve of your wedding.
You're a wicked old man, Uncle Willie.
Who takes this, anyway, your cook?
I love it.
It's got pictures of everything.
It certainly has.
Who is that terribly attractive man?
Can Tracy pick them, or can she?
If you're asking me...
I'm not.
Hello, darling.
Hello.
Well, how do you like me?
I adore you, but you look awful.
Awful?
Like something out of a shop window.
Well, Tracy, I...
What...?
Hey, what...?
Say, cut it out! They're new.
That's just it.
But they're not going to be. There, that's better.
I don't get it.
When I was a coal miner, the idea was to buy clean clothes.
Now that I'm general manager...
Say, Dinah anything in there about the wedding?
What do you mean?
I thought maybe you being one of the oldest families in Philadelphia and me getting fairly important myself...
It's luck, of course, but...
What's the matter?
Average Day in the Life of a Congressman.
The wife. The kitchen, where is prepared one banana, sliced, two fried eggs.
Congressman kisses wife good morning."
People like publicity.
Of all the filthy ideas.
Coming into a private house with a camera.
George Kittredge, you get on that horse.
What do you think?
What if I took it into my head to go into politics?
You'd be elected president.
I don't know about that.
I mean publicity. - Not in my home.
You mean our home, don't you?
Sorry, darling. I mean very much our home.
Oh, never mind, Eddie. I'll get up myself.
Now, steady, Bessie.
Whoa, Bessie. Whoa.
That's it...
Whoa, Bessie. Whoa!
Here, here, here.
Whoa.
Now, steady, Bessie.
Grab the reins, George, with the left hand.
Put salt on his tail.
Shut up.
Steady, Bessie.
There. Whoa, whoa, Bessie.
Whoa. Whoa.
What's the matter? You act worried.
Maybe it's because his name is Jack.
Heigh-ho, Silver.
Hello, Joe.
Hi, Mike.
I'm not gonna do it, Liz. I'm gonna tell Sidney Kidd I'm a writer.
I'm not a society snoop. Gonna tell him just that.
Just that.
Let Kidd fire me!
I'll write short stories again. That's what I should be doing.
I'm gonna tell him just that.
Just that.
Come in.
I don't think you're being fair to me.
No. You're treating me like you treat all your other writers.
You really hate me, don't you, Connor?
No. I don't like you very much, though.
You hate me, I trust, Miss Imbrie?
No. I can't afford to hate anybody. I'm only a photographer.
Ask him to wait.
Your assignment will be Spy's most sensational achievement:
Tracy Lord.
Big-game hunting in Africa, fox hunting in Pennsylvania.
Married on impulse and divorced in a rage, and always unapproachable by the press.
The unapproachable Miss Lord...
The Philadelphia Story."
Close to the Portals of Snobbish Fox Hunting." No.
No Hunter of Foxes is Spy Magazine."
Anyway, present it for the first time, quote:
A Wedding Day Inside Mainline Society."
Or What the Kitchen Maid Saw Through the Keyhole." Unquote.
Writing's your job. I'm only the publisher.
All right, publisher, take this:
Quote, "No Hunter of Buckshot in the Rear is Cagey, Crafty Connor." Unquote.
Close paragraph.
Close job, close bank account.
How can we get inside the Lord estate, let alone the house?
Now, we're not gonna do it, Liz. Doggone it, it's degrading. It's undignified.
So is an empty stomach. How do we get in?
Ask the gentleman to come in.
I understand we understand each other.
Quite.
This gentleman has been employed in our Buenos Aires office.
He came yesterday on the clipper. I believe he can help with our problem.
How?
Tracy Lord's brother, Junius is in the American Embassy there.
And he's an old friend of this gentleman's.
He'll introduce you to the Lords as intimate friends of Junius.
Dear old Junius.
This Tracy Lord... She know you?
You might say Miss Lord and I grew up together.
You might also say you were her first husband.
Yes, you might.
Holy mackerel. What goes on here?
I remember your honeymoon very well. You and she on a little sailboat.
The True Love, wasn't it?
That's right. How did you know?
I was the only photographer whose camera you didn't smash.
You were terribly nice about it. You threw it in the ocean.
Oh, one of those, huh?
Yes, I had a strange idea our honeymoon was our business.
He paid for all the cameras.
I got a nice little letter of apology too.
Always the gentleman, huh?
Except on occasion.
Now, what are the plans?
The wedding's Saturday. Today is Thursday.
They should spend tomorrow as guests of the Lords.
Listen, there's something screwy here. If you resigned, why are you doing this unless you...
Oh, you wanna get even with your ex-bride, huh?
I'll have a car pick them up at noon tomorrow in North Philadelphia.
Here, Mike, there's a little spit in your eye. It shows.
Maybe they'd rather we go to the servants' entrance.
Maybe this is the servants' entrance.
Good morning, Edward.
Why, Mr. Haven, sir.
Is Mrs. Haven...
I mean, Miss Tracy or her mother in?
They may be down at the swimming pool. Shall I announce you?
No. No, I'll go around myself and surprise them.
It will be a surprise.
These are friends of Mr. Junius.
Have them wait in the south parlor.
Certainly, Mr. Haven.
Excuse me, sir.
The south parlor?
Miss Imbrie, the south parlor.
The queen will have bread and honey at the usual time.
Seems a little cold for the south parlor.
I rather expected to find pickaninnies and banjos.
What's this room?
I forgot my compass.
Well, this would be south-southwest parlor by living room.
Knickknacks, gimcracks, signed photographs.
You have to be rich as the Lords to live in a dump like this.
I wouldn't live in it if they paid me.
They won't.
Looks like they're running a hock shop on the side.
Well, I...
Just looking around.
I'll want your fingerprints for this.
What's this guy Haven up to?
C.K. Dexter Haven.
What kind of a name is that, anyway?
C.K. Dexter Haven.
Well, Macaulay Connor is no homespun tag, my pet.
Well, you just try calling me Macaulay.
I knew a plain Joe Smith once.
He was only a clerk in a hardware store, but he was an absolute rat.
C.K. Dexter Haven. He plays polo. He designs sailboats.
Class boats, very upper-class.
Oh, don't despair.
He's out, and Kittredge, man of the people, is in.
Quite a comer too, I understand. Political timber.
Poor guy. Wonder how he fell for it?
Liz, what did I tell you? Look, how do you like this:
Living room, sitting room, terrace, pool, stables."
So they can talk to the horses without having them in the house.
Don't, Mike.
Yes?
This is the bridal suite.
Send up a couple of caviar sandwiches and some beer.
What?
Who is this?
This is the voice of doom calling.
Your days are numbered to the seventh son of the seventh son.
Hello? Hello?
What's the matter?
One of the servants has been at the sherry again. I better go see.
Dexter!
Dexter, you've come back!
Dinah, my dream girl.
What in the name of...?
Oh, no, it can't be. He went to South America for two years.
Edward said they were at the swimming pool.
They seem to be here.
Dexter, don't you know that tomorrow is the wedding?
Oh, that's right. So it is.
You can go right back where you came from.
Can't. Dinah says it's awful here without me.
Hello, you sweet thing.
Red, you look in the pink.
You don't think I'd miss your wedding, do you?
Dexter, you wouldn't.
I'm not so sure he wouldn't.
No, Mother Lord, I assure you I wouldn't.
Tell us about Junius.
Stay to lunch.
Sure. Don't bother to open your house. Stay here.
No?
How about the groom?
He's staying at the gatehouse.
Oh, that's good.
Junius is fine.
He should be here.
He's heartbroken. I suggested representing him as best man.
George might prefer to have his best man sober.
I wish you'd represent George.
That's my loyal little girl.
You'll like the people Junius did send.
You haven't switched to dope, have you?
The people Junius did send, did you say?
You don't know Macaulay Connor or Elizabeth Imbrie, do you?
We can finish later.
I better introduce you.
Call me for...
Introduce me to whom?
Imbrie and Connor. Tell them which rooms they're to have.
He wants to know whether to wear a black or white tie to the party.
Rooms?
I'd better start from the beginning. Sit down.
They're friends of Junius.
And they expect to stay here?
I think that's queer, indeed.
It's queerer than that. It's paranoiac.
Well, it was Junius' idea.
They've been kind to him and there's...
You're lying, Dexter. I can always tell.
Can you, Red?
But if they're Junius' friends...
You went to work after the divorce.
Except for an interlude in alcoholic sanitariums.
You took a job in South America. For?
A magazine.
And it wasn't by chance Spy magazine?
You are a mass of intuition.
And Junius' friends are photographers? I never thought you'd sink to do...
What are you going to do?
I'm going to phone Junius.
Wait, Red, wait. You don't have to telephone Junius. I'll confess.
No, you're slipping, Red.
I used to be afraid of that look.
The withering glance of the goddess.
I didn't think that alcohol would...
Oh, shut up.
Dinah, stay here.
Oh, please, Mother.
Maybe he's going to sock her again.
Don't say sock.
Strike is quite an ugly enough word.
Who do they think they are, barging in on people?
They'll think you don't want them.
I want them out and you too.
Yes, your majesty, but first, could I interest you in some blackmail?
No.
Well, it's an article...
It's ready for publication in Spy.
And it's about your father and that dancer.
About Father and Tina Morrow?
Now, quiet. Dinah.
But they can't.
Well, they can't... Even if it's true.
Where do you get these?
Kidd, the editor.
He's got to be stopped.
Well, he is, temporarily.
If you'll allow those two to turn in a story on your wedding.
And when Kidd says a story, he means a story.
I'm going to be sick.
Yes, an intimate day with a society bride.
I am sick.
Tough, but that's the way it seems to be.
I'm to be examined, undressed, humiliated.
At 15 cents a copy.
And you, you...
You're loving it.
Am I, Red?
Well, we're hooked.
Are they reporters?
Not friends of Junius?
They aren't anybody's friends.
We're to pretend they are.
Why?
Don't ask me. There's a good reason, and it's my wedding, so please.
I'll bet it's Father and that dancer.
Dinah, what do you know?
Oh, I listen around.
Is there no privacy anymore?
Only in bed, Mother, and not always there.
Watching every little mannerism, jotting notes on how we talk and move.
Will they do that?
And all in that snide, corkscrew English.
If we have to submit to save Father's face which, incidentally, doesn't deserve it I'm giving them a picture of life that'll stand their hair on end.
No! Tracy, we must just be ourselves, very much ourselves.
But you want us to create a good impression.
They don't know that we know, I hope.
No, that was understood. The girl's nice. He writes stories.
Very down-to-earth.
They'll love us.
Oh, dear, you both better dress.
Please, promise to behave like ladies in front of these creatures.
We'll do our best, Mrs. Lord. I don't know how good that is.
Dexter, how perfectly dreadful.
And what will they say about Seth not being here for his daughter's wedding?
I know, darling.
Come on.
You better go and tell them how terribly happy we are to have them.
That's the old Quaker spirit, Mother Lord. Now, keep swinging.
Thought it was that butler.
The family will welcome you in a moment.
What with?
With open arms.
They're happy to have friends of Junius.
They don't know about us?
Why should they?
Look, Haven our research department didn't give us much data.
This fiancé of this girl, George Kittredge, age 32.
You know him well?
Well enough.
General manager, Quaker State Coal. Controlling interest owned by Seth Lord.
That's the girl's father, huh?
What a coincidence.
How'd he meet her?
Heaven brought them together, I imagine.
Seth Lord. See bankers' annual directory of directors.
So is there a library in town?
Yes.
I suppose you wouldn't know where.
Well, roughly. My grandfather built it.
Now, about this girl Tracy Samantha Lord.
What about her?
Well, what's her leading characteristic?
She has a horror of men who wear their hats in the house.
Leading characteristics to be filled in later.
I can fill them in right now.
The young, rich, rapacious American female.
No other country where she exists.
And would I change places with Tracy Samantha Lord for all her wealth and beauty?
Oh, boy, just ask me.
Well, tell four footmen to call me in time for lunch, will you?
How do you do?
Friends of my brother, are you not?
We...
I am Dinah Lord. My real name is Diana, but my sister changed it.
I'm Elizabeth Imbrie. This is Macaulay Connor.
I spoke French before I spoke English.
My childhood was in Paris, where my father worked in a bank.
The House of Morgan.
Really?
Can you play the piano?
I can, and sing at the same time. Listen.
What is this?
Idiot, probably.
Smallpox?
How do you do?
I'm Tracy Lord. It's so nice having you here.
How did you leave Junius?
We left Junius fine.
That little sister of yours...
Isn't she a dear?
So talented.
Junius is such a lamb, isn't he?
Yes, isn't he?
It's a pity none of the males of the family are going to be here to welcome you.
Where's your father?
Darling Papa.
I do hope you'll stay for my wedding.
We'd like to.
That was our idea.
I'm so glad it occurred to you.
The house is rather a mess, of course.
We'll all have to huddle here and overflow onto the porch.
I hope your rooms are comfortable.
Your father sick?
What a cunning little camera.
I'm afraid I'm a nuisance with it.
You couldn't be. I hope you'll take loads.
Dear Papa and Mama aren't allowing reporters in.
That is, except for little Mr. Grace, who does the social news.
Can you imagine a grown-up man having to sink so low?
It does seem kind of bad.
You're a kind of writer, aren't you, Mr. Connor?
Sort of.
A book?
Yes.
Under what name do you publish?
My own. Macaulay Connor.
What's the Macaulay for?
Well, my father taught English history.
I'm Mike to my friends.
Of whom you have many, I'm sure.
English history, it's always fascinated me. Cromwell, Robin Hood, Jack the Ripper.
Where did he teach?
I mean your father.
A high school in South Bend, Indiana.
South Bend.
It sounds like dancing, doesn't it?
You must have had a most happy childhood there.
It was terrific.
I'm so glad.
I didn't mean it that way.
I'm so sorry. Why?
Well, lack of wherewithal, I guess.
That doesn't always cause unhappiness, does it?
Not if you're the right kind of man.
George Kittredge, my fiancé, never had anything, and he...
Are either of you married?
No. - No.
You were, but you're divorced?
The fact is...
Surely you're not ashamed of it.
Of course I'm not ashamed of it.
Well, it was years ago. I was only a kid in Duluth.
Good heavens, Liz, you never told me...
You never asked me.
Well, I know, but you...
Joe Smith. Hardware.
Well, you're the darnedest girl, Liz.
I think I'm sweet.
Duluth. That must be a lovely spot. It's west of here, isn't it?
Sort of, but occasionally we get the breezes.
And this is your first visit in Philadelphia.
It's a quaint place, don't you think? Filled with relics. How old are you?
Thirty.
One book isn't much for a man of 30.
I don't mean to criticize.
You probably have interests outside work.
None.
I mean, unless...
How sweet.
Are you going together?
I beg your pardon?
That is an odd question, I must say.
Well, I don't see why. I think it's very interesting.
Miss Imbrie don't you agree if a man says he loves a girl, he ought to marry?
Can she be human?
Please, I asked Miss Imbrie a question.
Well, that depends. L...
I'll see what's keeping Mama.
Look, who's doing the interviewing here?
You don't suppose she caught on?
No. She was born that way.
Don't let her throw you.
Want to take over?
I wanna go home.
Here you are.
How do you do? We're happy to have you.
Forgive me for not coming in sooner. Things are in such a state.
My little girl.
She's going to leave me.
Aren't you pretty, my dear? But then Junius' friends always are.
Look at the way she wears her hair, Tracy.
Isn't it pretty?
Mighty fine.
Shall we have sherry on the porch?
Thank you.
This is my youngest daughter, Diana.
I think we've met.
I wish my husband were here. We expect him presently.
He's been detained on business for that lovely dancer Tina Morrow.
Do you know her work? - Not professionally.
So talented and such a lovely person, but like many artists, no business head.
None whatever.
I have some lovely presents.
Don't you think so, Mr. Connor?
Hello, everybody.
I hope I'm not late.
You're never late, George.
We have a lovely surprise. Junius has sent us these dear people as a wedding present.
Mr. Kittredge, this is Miss...?
I'm so sorry.
Imbrie.
Any friend of Junius is a friend of mine.
And Mr...?
I didn't get the name.
Connor.
Macaulay Connor.
He's a writer.
Don't apologize...
No apology necessary. I have respect for writers.
Well, thank you. Any kind word is...
How are you, dear?
Much better now that you're here.
I guess this must be love.
Your guess is correct.
I'm just his faithful old dog, Tray.
Give me your paw.
You've got it.
How sweet.
Say, I'd like to see one of those.
You will.
Shall we have some sherry?
I suppose Junius has told you all about our family.
Papa!
What?
Dear Papa!
You angel, to get here in time for lunch.
Isn't he, Mama?
Indeed he is, but...
Father, this is Miss Imbrie and Mr. Connor.
How are you, Mr. Lord?
Fine, thank you.
How are you? - How do you do?
How do you do?
Hiya, Pops.
Oh, dear Dinah.
Father, here's George.
Hello, Kittredge. Margaret, my sweet.
Another place for luncheon, Edward.
Very good, madam.
Well here I am.
In the bosom of my...
Hello, friends and enemies.
Young man remove yourself.
How are you, sir?
I don't know. Get along, get along.
I changed my mind. I will stay for lunch.
Another place, Edward.
Hello, Kittredge.
How are you, Haven?
Just Damon and Pythias.
No. Grant and Lee.
You don't look as well as when I last saw you, Kittredge.
Oh, you poor fellow, I know just how you feel.
How's it coming?
Oh, beautifully, Dexter.
We're so indebted to you for these lovely people.
It's almost impossible to repay that debt.
But you'll manage, Red?
They grew up together, you know.
How nice.
You don't look old enough to get married, not even the first time.
She needs trouble to mature her. Give her lots of it.
I'm afraid she can't count on me for that.
No? That's too bad.
For your sake, you should have stuck to me longer.
I thought it was for life, but the nice judge gave me a full pardon.
That's the old redhead, no bitterness, no recrimination, just a swift left to the jaw.
They grew up together.
Luncheon is served, madam.
Thank you, Edward. Come, Seth. We have so much to talk about.
I don't suppose a man ever had a better or finer family.
I often wake up in the night and say:
Seth, you lucky dog, what have you done to deserve it all?"
And what have you?
Oh, thank you.
How stupid of me.
Oh, dear, how awful!
Oh, dear, I had a feeling that would happen.
Your camera. Well, I'm so, so sorry.
I'm sure you are.
What is it?
Your father.
Uncle Willie!
Uncle Willie, how nice.
I beg your pardon?
Please go on into lunch, everyone. I want a word with Uncle Willie.
Another place, Edward.
I'm afraid I don't understand.
You never have, but you came anyway, didn't you?
Still justice with her shining sword, daughter?
We are, thanks to you Uncle Willie.
How long will you be researching?
Not long, if I find the right books. Family history and stuff.
There's a cousin Joanna that's crazy.
Who told you?
Dinah.
Dinah should know.
Come across when you finish, Miss Hobson's.
Hobson, okay.
What is thee wish?
I'm looking for some local b...
What did you say?
What is thee wish?
Local biography or history.
If thee will consult with my colleague in there.
Dost thou have a washroom?
Thank thee.
Look, I know this is a public library, but I would...
Hello.
Hello.
Couldn't you afford to buy my book?
The bookstore didn't have one.
Are you doing the right thing?
Know what happens to girls like you who read my books?
They begin to think. That's bad.
These stories are beautiful.
Why, Connor, they're almost poetry.
Well, don't kid yourself.
They are.
I can't make you out at all now.
Really?
I thought I was easy.
So did I.
But you're not.
You...
You talk so big and tough, and then you write like this.
Which is which?
Both, I guess.
No.
No, I...
I believe you put the toughness on to save your skin.
Well, you think so?
I know a little about that.
Do you?
Quite a lot.
Look, let's get out of here.
This book, it was just such a complete surprise to me.
Let's walk. It'd be much more fun.
Tell Mr. Kittredge we'll meet him at the pool.
Yes, Miss Tracy.
The story "With the Rich and Mighty," I think I liked it best.
I got it from a Spanish peasant's proverb:
With the rich and mighty, always a little patience."
I like that.
What's the matter?
A little too rough?
A little but I'm used to it.
Tell me something, will you?
When you can do a thing like that book, how can you possibly do anything else?
You may not believe this, but there are people that must earn their living.
Of course, but people buy books, don't they?
Well, not as long as there's a library around.
That book of mine represents two solid years' work and it netted Connor something under $600.
But that shouldn't be.
Well, unhappily, it is.
Beautiful country around here.
What is it all?
Part of our place.
What about your Miss Imbrie?
Miss Imbrie's in somewhat the same fix.
She's a born painter and might be an important one, but she must eat and also prefers a roof over her head to being out in the rain and snow.
Food and a roof...
Hey, you've really got something here.
Where?
Well, all this.
Come on, the dressing rooms are over here.
I think you'll find everything you need.
Use any old one, but you'll find most of the junk in there.
Yell if you need anything.
Okay.
Hey, Connor!
Yeah?
I have an idea.
What?
I have the most wonderful little house in Unionville.
It's up on a hill with a view that would knock you silly.
I'm never there except in the hunting season and not much then.
And I'd be so happy to know that it was of some real use to someone.
Can you hear me?
Yeah.
There's a brook and a small lake no size, really and a patch of woods, and in any kind of weather it's the most wonderful...
Well, anyhow, I'm so delighted that I can offer it to you.
Well, it's terribly nice of you, but...
Heck, that's Dexter.
Look, if he comes here stand by, will you?
I don't want to be alone with him.
Certainly.
Isn't it lucky I thought of that house?
Don't think I'd troop in every minute. I wouldn't.
I'd never come except when expressly asked to.
Well, it isn't that.
What is it?
You see, the idea of artists depending upon a patron lady bountiful has more or less gone out.
I see.
That wasn't especially kind of you, Mr. Connor.
I'm sorry to have seemed patronizing.
Oh, well, I didn't mean...
Please don't bother, really.
Hello. - Hello.
Fancy seeing you here.
Orange juice?
Certainly.
Don't tell me you've forsaken your beloved whiskey and whiskeys.
No, I've just changed colors. I'm going for pale pastel shades now.
They're more becoming to me.
How about you, Mr. Connor?
You drink? Alcohol, I mean.
Well, a little.
A little?
And you a writer?
I thought writers drank to excess and beat their wives.
At one time, I think I secretly wanted to be a writer.
Dexter, would you mind doing something for me?
Anything. What?
Get the heck out of here.
I couldn't do that. You need me too much.
Mind telling me just what you're hanging around for?
No, no. Please don't go, Mr. Connor.
Please don't go.
As a writer, this is right up your street.
Don't miss a word.
I never saw you better. You're getting that fine, tawny look.
We're going to talk about me, are we? Goody.
Astonishing what money can do. Don't you agree, Mr. Connor?
Not too much, you know, just more than enough.
Take Tracy, for example. Never a blow that hasn't been softened never one that won't be softened.
It changed her shape.
She was dumpy at one time.
As it happens, I'm not interested in myself for the moment.
Not interested in yourself?
You're fascinated.
You're far and away your favorite person.
Dexter, in case you don't know...
She's a girl who's generous to a fault.
To a fault, Mr. Connor.
Except to other people's faults.
She never had any understanding of my deep and gorgeous thirst.
That was your problem.
Granted.
But you took on that problem when you took me, Red.
You were no helpmate. You were a scold.
It was disgusting, made you unattractive.
A weakness, sure.
Strength is her religion, Mr. Connor.
She finds human imperfection unforgivable.
When I discovered my relationship to her was supposed to be not that of a loving husband and a good companion, but...
Oh, never mind.
Say it.
But that of a kind of high priest to a virgin goddess then my drinks grew deeper and more frequent, that's all.
I never considered you as that, nor myself.
You did without knowing it.
And the night you got drunk on champagne and climbed out on the roof and stood there naked with your arms out to the moon wailing like a banshee.
I never had the slightest recollection of any such thing.
I know. You drew a blank. You wanted to.
Mr. Connor, what would you...?
A nice story for Spy, incidentally.
Too bad we can't supply photos of you.
The fuss you made over that childish episode!
It was enormously important and most revealing.
The moon is also a goddess chaste and virginal.
Stop using those foul words.
What are you trying to make me out as?
What do you fancy yourself as?
I don't know that I fancy...
I can't believe you're going to marry Kittredge.
How could you think of it?
He's everything you're not.
He's been poor.
He's had to work and fight for everything and I love him as I never even began to love you.
Maybe, but I doubt it. I think it's just a swing from me.
But it's too violent a swing.
Kittredge is no great tower of strength, you know. He's just a tower.
You hardly know him.
To hardly know him is to know him well.
It offends my vanity to have anyone who was even remotely my wife remarry so obviously beneath her.
How dare you, in this day and age, use such an idiotic...
I'm talking about the difference in mind and spirit.
You could marry Mac the night watchman. I'd cheer.
Kittredge is not for you.
You bet he's for me.
He's a great man and a good man.
Already, he's of national importance.
You sound like Spy magazine talking.
But whatever he is, toots, you'll have to stick.
He'll give you no out, as I did.
I won't require one.
I suppose you'll still be attractive to any man of spirit.
There's something engaging about this goddess business more challenging to the male than the more obvious charms.
Really?
Really.
We're very vain, you know.
This citadel can and shall be taken, and I'm the boy to do it.
You seem quite contemptuous of me, all of a sudden.
No, Red. Not of you.
Never of you.
Red, you could be the finest woman on this earth.
I'm contemptuous of something you can't help or make no attempt to.
Your so-called strength.
Your prejudice against weakness, your blank intolerance.
Is that all?
That's the gist of it.
Because you'll never be a first-class human being or woman until you've learned to have some regard for human frailty.
It's a pity your own foot can't slip a little sometime.
But your sense of inner divinity wouldn't allow that.
This goddess must and shall remain intact.
There are more of you than people realize, a special class of the American female.
The married maidens.
So help me, if you say another... - I'm through, Red.
I've had my say.
Well I suppose I should object to this twosome.
That would be most objectionable.
Anytime either of you want my advice...
We'll give you a ring.
Thanks. Do that, will you?
So long, Red.
I left you a wedding present. Sorry I hadn't any ribbon to tie it up with.
Aren't you swimming?
We haven't time. Uncle Willie wants us at 8.
Look what your friend considers a wedding present.
Why, it's a model of the True Love.
The what?
A boat he designed and built, practically.
We sailed it down the coast of Maine the summer we were married.
My, she was yare.
Yare? What's that mean?
It means...
What does it mean?
Easy to handle, quick to the helm, fast, bright.
Everything a boat should be until she develops dry rot.
Oh, George, to get away!
Somehow, to be useful in the world.
Useful?
You, Tracy?
Why, I'm gonna build you an ivory tower with my own two hands.
Like fun you are.
You mean you've been in one too long?
Well, I mean that and a lot of things.
We're gonna represent something, Tracy you and I and our home something straight and sound and fine.
Then perhaps your friend Mr. Haven will be somewhat less condescending.
George...
You...
You don't really mind him, do you?
I mean the fact of him?
The fact of him"? What do you mean?
Well, I mean...
Well, you know, that he ever was my lord and master.
I don't believe he ever was, Tracy.
Not really.
I don't believe that anyone ever was or ever will be.
That's the wonderful thing about you, Tracy.
What?
How?
Well, you're like some marvelous, distant well, queen, I guess.
You're so cool and fine and always so much your own.
There's a kind of beautiful purity about you, like a statue.
George...
Oh, it's grand, Tracy.
It's what everybody feels about you. What I first worshipped you for from afar.
George, listen...
First, now and always.
Only from a little nearer now, darling.
I...
I don't want to be worshipped. I want to be loved.
Well, you're that too, Tracy.
Oh, you're that, all right.
I mean really loved.
But that goes without saying, Tracy.
No.
No, now it's you who doesn't see what I mean.
I...
Well, I better get dressed, dear. I hate to be late.
George?
Yes.
Oh, nothing.
Run along. I'll be dressed when you get back.
Tracy. You're Uncle Willie's guest of honor. You mustn't be late.
Your fiancé just rode out of here on two wheels.
Does he, by any chance, walk anywhere?
When he likes, I expect.
He'll take that ring tomorrow and go through center with it.
Seth, you idiot.
Very amusing, I'm sure.
Almost as amusing as the sight of you with your arm around Mother.
I find very unamusing the stupid, undignified spectacle we're making of ourselves for those two newspaper people.
Whose fault is it?
That's not the point.
They can publish anything they like about me, but I insist we inform Connor and the camera lady we're all aware of their purpose.
All right. I'll tell them myself.
It'd look better coming from me as at least the titular head of the family.
Of course, inasmuch as you've let us in for it.
Do keep that note out of your voice, Tracy. It's very unattractive.
How does your dancer friend talk?
Or does she purr?
Tracy!
No, it's quite all right, Margaret.
Sweet and low, dulcet, very ladylike.
You've got nerve to come back in your head-of-the-family manner and make stands and strike attitudes and criticize my fiancé give orders and mess things up...
Stop it!
It's sickening, as if he'd done nothing at all!
Which happens to be the truth.
Anyway, it's not your affair, Tracy, if it concerns anyone.
Actually, I don't know whom it concerns, except your father.
That's very wise of you, Margaret.
Most wives fail to realize their husbands' philandering has nothing whatever to do with them.
Then what has it to do with?
A reluctance to grow old, I think.
The best mainstay a man can have as he gets along in years is a daughter.
The right kind of daughter.
How sweet.
No, I'm talking seriously about something I've thought over thoroughly.
I think a devoted young girl gives a man the illusion that youth is still his.
Very important, I suppose.
Oh, very, very.
Without her, he might be inclined to go in search of his youth.
It's just as important to him as it is to any woman.
But with a girl of his own, full of warmth for him full of foolish, uncritical affection...
None of which I've got.
None.
You have a good mind, a pretty face, a disciplined body doing what you tell it everything it takes to make a lovely woman, except the one essential.
An understanding heart.
Without that, you might as well be made of bronze.
That's an awful thing to say to anyone.
Yes, it is indeed.
So I'm to blame for Tina Morrow, am I?
To a certain extent, I expect you are.
You coward!
No but better that than a prig or a perennial spinster however many marriages.
That's too much.
It's not enough. I'm afraid nothing is.
What did you say I was?
Do you want me to repeat it?
A prig and...
You mean, you think I think I'm some kind of a goddess or something?
If your ego wants it that way, yes.
Also, you've been talking like a jealous woman.
What's the matter with everyone all at once, anyhow?
I've been asleep. What time is it?
After 7.
Call my house. Tell them I'm on my way. You better come.
After all, you're the host "Uncle Willie."
That's over. You're yourself. So am I.
Have you told them?
I shall, at the first opportunity.
My first party, and about time.
Can I have a cocktail?
Certainly not.
It's a dirty gyp.
That dress hikes up a little behind.
No, it's me that does.
You look adorable, Dinah.
Thanks, Tracy. Thanks ever so much.
Tracy, you must dress.
Let's all have a last drink.
Sorry, I forgot. You never drink.
Prigs don't.
What's that?
Nor spinsters.
Again, please?
Nor goddesses of any variety.
Not completely. Just a borderline case.
Mr. And Mrs. Lord, Miss Imbrie and I have something on our mind.
Just the place for it.
What? - We'd like to say something.
I'm all ears and eyes.
You're a vision of loveliness, Miss Imbrie.
Will you have cocktail or champagne?
Oh, champagne. I've never had enough.
You will tonight.
I'd like to say...
No, I have something to say.
I am Seth Lord.
No!
Then that makes you...
Available.
And you are Miss Imbrie of Spy magazine.
Now you know.
I was going to tell you...
Now, as to the reasons...
Seth, we really ought to be early.
And who'll go with me in my little car?
Dinah and I. Seth, will you take Miss Imbrie and Mr. Connor?
Dinah.
I can tell there's something in the air, because I'm being taken away.
Well, I'll see you all later.
Don't do that. What's the matter?
Nothing.
Miss Imbrie?
You know, I felt exactly as though I'd been pinched.
Don't you think you weren't.
You aren't even dressed.
You go ahead.
I'll follow along with George.
What's the matter with Tracy?
You tell me, will you?
Darned if I know. I'd like to.
Well, Macaulay, if you ever happen to find out...
I'll tell you. Sure.
And remember, Mike with the rich and mighty...
Do you know what time it is?
It's after 4.
In China, it's later than that.
In China, we'd be married by now.
Or perhaps it's only yesterday.
I'm going home after this.
There was a Chinese poet who was drowned while trying to kiss the moon in the river.
He was drunk.
I'd say as much.
But he wrote beautiful poetry.
Macaulay Connor of South Bend reporting for duty.
We're going home after this dance.
You can't do that to me, not a friend of old Junius.
I mean, not an old friend of Junius.
I wish old Junius were here.
Tracy, I'll get your wraps.
He'll wrap me up.
Hello, you.
Hello.
Hey, you look fine.
I feel fine.
Good, good.
Oh, wait. Wait.
What was I saying?
Let's have a drink. Or would Kittredge spank?
That's not what you were saying.
It isn't? All right.
Not what I was saying...
I know. Why do you wish your brother was here?
He likes Kittredge?
Everybody likes Kittredge.
Everybody likes Kittredge.
Everybody except C.K. Dexter Haven?
Come on, Connor. We'll have some wine.
We'll have some wine.
Mother!
I thought you'd gone home ages ago.
I should have, but I've been having such a good time.
Everybody should have a good time.
Darling, what's come over you?
It's just that a lot of things I always thought were terribly important I find now are...
And the other way around...
Oh, what the dickens.
Connor, you're thirsty, and the night is young.
Here we are, dear.
We'll have one more...
Not you, I'm afraid, dear.
Why should you be afraid, George?
Wine never affects me, not in the slightest.
What she really wants, George, is another dance with you.
Very well.
George, if it's that much of a chore...
Not for me!
Oh, no, you've been too attentive.
George, please.
What will the neighbors think?
The course of true love...
Gathers no moss.
Bunny, where's Brenda?
She's with Gigs and Phee.
No, Brenda's with John.
Boy, champagne.
Just the bottle.
I'm going on a picnic.
You're leaving us?
Rather, but I'll be back.
Come on, darling.
Champagne, and again and again and again.
Follow that cab.
What cab, sir?
No cab.
Some joke, huh?
Take me to the Dexter Haven mansion.
Mr. Haven?
Front entrance.
C.K. Dexter Haven!
Oh, C.K. Dexter Haven!
C.K. Dexter Haven!
This is where Cinderella gets off.
Hurry back to the ball before you turn into a pumpkin and six white mice.
C.K. Dexter Haven.
What's up?
You are.
I only hope it's worth it.
Come on in.
I bring you greetings.
Cinderella's slipper.
It's called champagne. Champagne is a great leveler.
Leveler. It makes you my equal.
Well, I wouldn't quite say that.
Well, almost my equal.
C.K. Dexter Haven, I would like to talk to you.
Well, let's go in the talking room.
Don't tell me the party's over so soon.
No, no.
I just felt like talking to you.
Well, that's nice.
I wonder if I might borrow a drink.
Certainly. Coals to Newcastle.
Here. Sit down.
Excuse me.
What's this?
What's that, my book?
! - Yes.
C.K. Dexter Haven, you have unsuspected depth.
Oh, thanks, old chap.
But have you read it?
I was trying to stop drinking. I read anything.
And did you stop drinking?
Yes. Your book didn't do it, though.
Are you still in love with her?
Or perhaps you consider that a very personal question.
Not at all.
Liz thinks you are.
Liz thinks you are, but of course, women like to romanti...
Romanticize about things.
Yes, they do, don't they?
Yes, they do, don't they?
I can't understand how you could've been married to her and know so little about her.
Can't you?
No, I can't you.
I have the hiccups.
I wonder if I might have another.
Certainly.
Thank you.
You know, Tracy's no ordinary woman and you said things to her this afternoon I resented.
I apologize, Mr. Connor.
That's quite all right.
But when a girl is like Tracy, she's one in a million.
She's sort of like a...
She's sort of like a...
A goddess?
No, no, no!
You said that word this afternoon. No.
No, she's...
She's sort of like a queen.
A radiant, glorious queen.
And you can't treat her like other women.
No, I suppose not.
I imagine Kittredge appreciates all that.
Kittredge? !
Kittredge appreciates Kittredge!
That fake man of the people.
He isn't even smart.
He's a five-cent edition of Sidney Kidd.
Well, I always thought Kidd himself was the five-cent Kidd.
And what's that make you worth, C.K. Dexter Haven?
Bringing us down here?
You know why I did that.
To get even with my ex-bride. You told me yourself.
Doggone it, C.K. Dexter Haven, either I'm gonna sock you or you're gonna sock me.
Shall we toss a coin?
You know, Kidd is just using you like he uses everybody else.
You don't know Kidd like I know him.
The guy's colossal. He's terrific.
Got everybody fooled.
Yes.
No mean Machiavelli is smiling, cynical Sidney Kidd.
The world's his oyster, with an R in every month.
That's not bad. When did I say that?
You didn't. I did. Sorry.
You never heard about Kidd's arrangement in Kansas City?
No.
In San Francisco?
Let me tell you about the time he went to Boston to be awarded the Sarah Langley Medal for World Peace.
The true story on that little jaunt would ruin him.
Look, Connor, what would happen to you if I used this?
Why?
I might want to very much.
You see, Kidd is holding a dirty piece on Tracy's father. This might stop him.
On Tracy's father?
That's right.
Oh, so that's how Kidd got you to...
That's how Liz and I were gotten in.
Blackmail, huh?
We all rode into this thing on a filthy blackmail.
Well, look, you use it with my blessings. I'm cooked. I'm through anyway.
I'm not gonna hand in a story on this wedding. I'm gonna write one on Kidd.
No, let me. I don't have to tell him where I got my facts, okay?
Okay.
All right. Come on.
Now, shoot.
Peace medal. Boston.
The time: May 1938. The place:
Kidd had just arrived.
And this same Sidney Kidd, ladies and gentlemen of America this protector of American democracy and homes and firesides was at that moment entertaining this South Carolina Mata Hari on his yacht.
Don't interrupt me!
This Sidney Kidd, ladies and gentlemen, who demanded the respect of all who were connected with him...
We've come for the body of Macaulay Connor.
Can you use a typewriter?
No, thanks, I have one at home.
Who's that?
Here was Sidney Kidd, ladies and gentlemen.
Kidd the good, Kidd the noble...
Where's Kittredge?
People's choice?
His bride just dropped him at the gatehouse after a slight explosion.
What, a fight?
Fifteen rounds. No decision.
Where's my wandering parakeet?
You look beautiful, Red.
Come on in.
Why?
No particular reason. A drink maybe?
I don't drink.
That's right. I forgot.
I haven't.
Show Liz to a typewriter and stand back.
Can she do it?
She can and she will.
You dictate to her and bring her home.
Aren't you coming?
I've got to commit suicide first.
Going my way, miss?
Miss Goddess to you.
Okay, Miss Goddess to me.
That champagne's funny stuff. I'm used to whiskey.
Whiskey is a slap on the back, and champagne's heavy mist before my eyes.
Do you hear a telephone ringing?
I did a little while ago. Let's see.
No, not yet.
Now I do. Far away.
It's my bedroom telephone.
Couldn't be anyone but George.
I was sort of swinish to him.
Perhaps I'd better go and see what...
It isn't ringing anymore.
I tell you what let's have a quick swim to brighten us up.
Dexter and I always swam after parties.
Let's dip into this instead, huh?
Hello, you.
Hello.
You look fine.
I feel fine.
Did you enjoy the party?
Sure, sure.
The prettiest sight in this pretty world is the privileged class enjoying its privileges.
You're a snob, Connor.
No doubt, no doubt.
Awash with champagne was Will Q. Tracy's pleasure dome on the nuptial eve of Tracy Samantha...
Tracy Samantha...
Tracy you can't marry that guy.
George?
I'm going to.
Why not? - Well, I don't know.
I thought I'd be for it at first, but you just don't match up.
Then the fault's with me.
Maybe so, but all the same, you can't do it.
No?
No.
Come around about noon tomorrow...
I mean today.
Snob.
You're the worst kind there is an intellectual snob.
You made up your mind awfully young, it seems to me.
Thirty's about time to make up your mind, and I'm nothing of the sort, not Connor.
The time to make up your mind about people is never.
Yes, you are. And a complete one.
You're quite a girl.
You think?
I know.
Thank you, professor.
I don't think I'm exceptional.
You are.
I know any number like me.
You ought to get around more.
Yes.
Within the upper class?
No, no. No, thank you.
You're just a mass of prejudices, aren't you?
You're so much thought and so little feeling, professor.
Oh, I am, am I?
Yes, you am, are you.
Your intolerance infuriates me.
I should think that of all people a writer would need tolerance.
The fact is, you'll never...
You can't be a first-rate writer or a first-rate human being, until you've learned to have some small regard for human frai...
Aren't the geraniums pretty, professor?
Is it not a handsome day that begins professor?
Yes, professor.
You've got all the arrogance of your class, haven't you?
What have classes to do with it?
What do they matter except for people in them?
George comes from the so-called lower class, Dexter, the upper. Well?
Mac the night watchman is a prince, Uncle Willie is a pincher.
Upper and lower, my eye. I'll take the lower, thanks.
If you can't get a drawing room.
What do you mean?
My mistake.
Decidedly. You're insulting!
Sorry.
Oh, don't apologize.
Well, who's apologizing?
I never knew such a man.
You wouldn't be likely to from where you sit.
Talk about arrogance.
Tracy.
What do you want?
You're wonderful.
There's a magnificence in you, Tracy.
Now I'm getting self-conscious.
It's funny. I...
Mike, let's...
Yeah?
I don't know.
Go up, I guess. It's late.
The magnificence that comes out of your eyes and your voice and the way you stand there and the way you walk.
You're lit from within, Tracy.
You've got fires banked down in you.
Hearth fires and holocausts.
I don't seem to you made of bronze?
No, you're made out of flesh and blood.
That's the blank, unholy surprise of it.
Why, you're the golden girl, Tracy, full of life and warmth and delight.
Well, what goes on? You've got tears in your eyes.
Shut up. Shut up.
Oh, Mike, keep talking, keep talking. Talk, will you?
No, no, I...
I've stopped.
Why?
Has your mind taken hold again, dear professor?
Good thing, don't you agree?
No, professor.
Lay off that "professor" stuff.
Now, do you hear me?
Yes, professor.
It's really all I am to you?
Of course.
Are you sure?
Why, yes, of course...
Golly.
Golly Moses!
Tracy.
Mr. Connor...
Let me tell you...
I've got the shakes.
It can't be love, can it?
No, no, it mustn't be. It can't.
Would it be inconvenient?
Terribly.
Anyway, I know it isn't.
We're out of our minds.
And into our hearts.
That ought to have music.
It does, doesn't it? You're lovely.
It's as if my insteps were melting away.
What is it?
Have I got feet of clay or something?
It's not far to the pool. It's just over the lawn, and it'll be lovely.
You're tremendous.
Put me in your pocket, Mike.
Oh, I can't imagine what makes me so sleepy.
Couldn't be the company, could it?
Well, it's you, Mr. Dexter.
Hello, Mac.
I heard you were about.
Any prowlers around? - No, no.
No prowlers.
Can Miss Imbrie get in this way? - If she can't, you can go in the back.
Thanks, Mac. Good night.
Good night, sir.
Well, home after a hard day's blackmailing.
When are you gonna telephone Kidd?
In time to get him here for the wedding.
Why?
A sort of wedding present.
If it works.
If it works.
I could still tear it up.
No. Mike's only chance to ever become a really fine writer is to get fired.
You're a good number, Liz.
Oh, I just photograph well.
I'm certainly out of focus now.
Why don't you take a swim?
A swim?
Sure.
Tracy and I always took a swim after a party.
Did you?
Bet it was fun.
I'll have to try it with Mike sometime.
Liz why don't you marry him?
You really want to know?
He's still got a lot to learn.
I don't want to get in his way for a while.
Okay?
Okay.
It's risky, though, Liz.
Suppose another girl came along in the meantime?
I'd scratch her eyes out, I guess.
That is, unless she was going to marry somebody else the next day.
Hey!
Hello, Kittredge.
What are you doing here?
Friend of the family's. Dropped in for a chat.
Don't be funny. I asked you a question.
I could ask you the same question.
I telephoned Tracy, and her phone didn't answer.
I was worried, so I walked over.
I was worried too.
About what?
What do you think of this fellow Connor?
Or do you?
If you're trying to insinuate...
My dear chap, I wouldn't insinuate anything, only...
I'd advise you to go to bed.
I don't want your advice.
I'm staying here.
You're making a mistake.
Somehow I don't think you'll understand.
You better leave that to...
What's that?
That's Mac, always singing. I'll walk you around the house.
Something's going on here, and I'm staying.
And so are you.
All right, then.
Take the works. Only heaven help you.
Don't stop, Mikey. Keep crooning.
What is this?
Easy, old man. She's not hurt?
No, no.
Not wounded, sire, but dead.
Seems the minute she hit the water, the wine hit her.
Now, look here, Connor...
A likely story, Connor.
What'd you say?
I said, a likely story.
Listen...
You'll be down directly?
Yes, if you want.
I want.
Hello, Dexter.
Hello, George.
Hello, Mike.
Second door, top of the stairs. Don't wake Dinah.
My feet are made of clay, made of clay. Did you know?
Good night, Mother.
How are the mighty fallen.
Well, if I know Tracy, and I know her well, she'll remember little of this.
For the second time in her life, she'll draw quite a tidy blank.
You don't believe it, then?
Believe what?
Well, the...
The implications of what you saw, let us say.
Well, what else am I to believe?
That's entirely up to you.
I got eyes. I got imagination, haven't I?
I don't know. Have you?
Oh, so you pretend not to believe it?
Yes, I pretend not to.
Then you don't know women.
Possible.
And you're a fool.
Well, that's quite possible.
You won't be too hard on her?
I'll make up my own mind.
We're all only human, you know.
You...
All of you, with your sophisticated ideas.
Ain't it awful?
Well?
Why, you low...
Say, listen, what right have you...?
A husband's. Till tomorrow, Kittredge.
Oi. Oi, fella.
How do you feel?
Now, look, if you think I...
I know. I'm sorry.
I thought I'd better hit you before he did. He's in better shape than I am.
Well, you'll do.
Hello, Mr. Dexter. Anything wrong?
Not a thing. Just as quiet as a church.
Who is it?
Doggone, I thought it might have been Mr. Kittredge.
Well, we can't have everything, Mac.
Good night.
Mr. Tracy.
Good grief, man, don't scream at me at the top of your voice.
Miss Dinah is waiting for you, sir.
Miss Dinah, waiting for me?
Where and why?
Just outside the door. I don't know why.
This is one of those days which the pages of history teach us are best spent lying in bed.
Yes, sir.
Uncle Willie!
Uncle Willie! Where are you going?
Back to bed unless you give me your oath you'll speak in a civilized tone.
I'll be quiet, Uncle Willie.
It's so important that I see you.
Must we ride in that?
Wouldn't we be more comfortable on pogo sticks?
I had to be alone with you, and this is very intimate.
What's the matter?
Oh, nothing much.
My head just fell off, that's all.
What is all this gibberish about Mr. Connor?
What makes you suspect what, and since when?
Last night and well into the morning.
Uncle Willie, isn't my duty to tell George?
He might want to marry her anyway.
But she can't.
If she marries anyone, it's got to be Mr. Connor.
Why, Dinah, what makes you think she should?
Apparently the little cherub has heard or seen something.
That's Dexter's own Dinah.
You have a certain amount of cheek, walking in here on this of all mornings.
Do I?
Yes.
What's all this about Mr. Connor?
Did the party last night give you bad dreams?
It wasn't any dream.
It's hard to tell once you've gone to sleep, isn't it?
Is it?
What, ho, the bride.
Tracy.
Hello.
Isn't it a fine day, though?
Is everybody fine?
That's fine.
My, I'm hearty.
How do you feel otherwise?
I don't know what's the matter with me. I must have had too much sun yesterday.
My eyes don't open properly.
Really?
Please go home, Dext.
Not until we've got those eyes open.
Uncle Willie. Good morning.
That remains to be seen.
Aren't you here early, Uncle Willie?
It's nearly half past 12.
Well, it can't be. Where's Mother?
She's talking with the orchestra, Father with the minister.
And Mr. Connor, he hasn't come down yet.
And it's your wedding day, remember?
Thanks loads. It's nice to have things...
I wonder what this might be.
Looks terribly like a watch.
But whose? I found it in my room.
I nearly stepped on it.
Also, I think I was robbed at your house last night, Uncle Willie.
My bracelet and engagement rings are...
Here you are.
But you weren't at the party.
Wasn't I?
Were you?
Now, don't tell me you don't remember.
I do. Now.
Sort of.
But there were such a lot of people. I stayed so late.
Should've taken a swim when you got home.
A swim?
A swim?
There. Now they're open.
That was just the beginning, and it was no dream.
Speaking of eye-openers...
First sane remark I've heard today.
I know a formula said to pop the pennies off the eyelids of dead Irishmen.
Dinah, if the conversation should lag, you might tell Tracy about your dream.
What did he say?
Oh, nothing.
Tray, I hate you to get married and go away.
I'll miss you, darling. I'll miss all of you.
You know, I did have the funniest dream about you last night.
Did you?
Do you like my dress, Dinah?
Yes, ever so much.
Feels awfully heavy.
It was all certainly pretty rooty-tooty.
What was?
My dream.
Oh, Dinah.
I dreamed I got up and went over to the window.
Guess what I dreamed I saw coming out of the woods?
I haven't the faintest idea. A skunk?
Well, sort of.
It was Mr. Connor.
Mr. Connor?
Yes. With his both arms full of something, and guess what it turned out to be.
What?
You. And some clothes.
Wasn't it funny?
It was sort of like as if you were coming from the pool.
The pool?
I'm going crazy. I'm standing here solidly on my own two hands and going crazy.
Then what?
Then after a while I opened my door a crack, and there he was still coming along with you, puffing like a steam engine.
His wind can't be very good.
Then what?
Then you were sort of crooning.
I never crooned in my life.
I'm only saying what it sounded like.
And then he...
Guess what.
I couldn't possibly.
He sailed right into your room with you.
That scared me, so I got up and went to your door and peeked in to make sure you were all right.
And guess what.
What?
You were. He was gone by then.
Gone?
Of course he was gone. He was never there.
I know, Tracy.
I should certainly hope you did.
I'm certainly glad I do.
Because if I didn't, and in a little while I heard the minister say:
If anyone knows any just cause or reason why these two should not be united in holy matrimony..." I just wouldn't know what to do.
Dexter says it's a dream too.
You told Dexter all that?
Not a word, not a single word.
You know how quick he is.
Dinah, you little fiend, how can you...?
Dinah.
Your mother wants to have a look at you.
I look wonderful. I smell good too.
Father?
Yes, Tracy?
I...
I'm glad you came back.
I'm glad you're here.
Why, thank you, child.
I'm sorry I'm...
Truly sorry I'm a disappointment to you.
I never said that, daughter and I never will.
Good morning.
Hello.
Testing the air.
I like it, but it doesn't like me.
Hello, Dinah.
How do you do?
Did you have a good sleep?
Wonderful, wonderful. You?
Marvelous. Have you ever seen a handsomer day?
Never, never. What did it set you back?
I got it for nothing. For being a good girl.
Good, good.
Don't worry, I'm going.
Why should you?
Well, I guess you must have things you wish to discuss.
Only remember it's getting late.
She's always trying to make situations.
Well.
Well.
What's the matter with your chin?
Chin?
Does it show very much?
A little. What happened?
I guess I stuck it out too far.
Into a door in the dark?
Yes, yes. That's it. Tracy, what about you?
Me?
Oh, of course.
Why shouldn't I be?
Well, that was a flock of wine we got away with.
I guess we're lucky both to have such good heads.
Yeah, yeah I guess that's it.
Well, anyway I had a simply wonderful evening.
I hope you enjoyed it too.
I enjoyed the last part of it.
Really?
Why especially the last?
Well, Tracy, are you asking me?
Oh, you mean the swim.
Well...
We did swim and so forth, didn't we?
Mike.
Oh, Tracy, darling.
Mike.
What can I say? Tell me, darling.
Not anything. Don't say anything, and especially not "darling."
Then you're going through with it?
With what?
The wedding.
Why shouldn't I?
Well, I made a funny discovery.
In spite of the fact somebody's up from the bottom he can still be a heel.
And even though somebody else is born to the purple he can still be a very nice guy.
Well, I'm just repeating what you said last night.
I said a lot of things last night, it seems.
Okay. No dice.
Also no regrets about last night, huh?
Why should I have?
Tracy, you're wonderful.
You don't know what I mean.
I'm asking you. Tell me straight out. Tell me the reason I should have had.
No, don't.
Just tell me what time is it?
What...?
Oh, I wonder what happened to my wristwatch.
Why, is it broken?
I must have lost it someplace.
I can't tell you how extremely sorry I am to hear that.
There. On the table.
I wonder who found it. I'd offer a reward or something.
I don't think that any reward will be expected.
Funny it would pop up here, isn't it?
Hey, what about an eye-opener, huh?
My eyes are opened.
Go ahead and get one if you want.
I think I will.
All right.
Yes, yes.
No, just give Mr. Kittredge a message.
Tell him he'd better start immediately.
Thank you.
Are you one of the musicians?
No.
Of course. You're Junius' friend. Only you're not.
You don't have any violin strings, do you?
Aspirin. Will that do? - I don't think so.
It's for a violin.
Oh, well. Don't bother.
Oh, dear.
Hello, Connor. How are you?
Just about as you'd think.
You seen Kidd?
I left a copy of it at my house for him.
And?
We'll have it out after the wedding.
Is that an alcoholic beverage?
Yes. Why?
For me?
It's for Tracy. Want one?
I'd sell my grandmother for a drink. You know I love my grandmother.
Uncle Willie's in the pantry doing weird and wonderful things.
Tell him I said one of the same.
Mind if I make it two?
That's between you and your grandmother.
Doctor's orders, Red.
What is it?
Just the juice of a few flowers.
It's a type of stinger. It removes the sting.
Oh, Dext, don't say that.
Well, why not, Red?
Nothing will. Nothing ever can.
Oh, Dext, I...
I've done the most terrible thing to you.
To me?
Oh, I doubt that. I doubt it very much, dear.
You don't know.
You don't know. - Well, maybe I shouldn't, huh?
But you must. You've got to. I couldn't stand it if you didn't.
Dext, what am I going to do?
But why to me, darling? Why ask me?
Why do I come into it anymore?
Aren't you confusing me with a fellow named Kittredge or something?
George!
George.
Splendid chap, George.
Very high morals. Very broad shoulders.
I've got to tell him. - Tell him what, darling?
I've got to tell him.
We've got to tell him.
If he's got brains, he'll see what a fool he made of himself.
How? Hello, George?
This...
I don't care whether it's bad luck or not, I've got to see you before the wedding.
What?
No, I didn't get it.
Right, right. Come on the run.
He sent a note over at 10:00.
Good. I told you he'd come to his senses.
Was he here too?
Sure.
Good golly, why didn't you sell tickets?
Say something, Dext.
Say anything.
No, you do.
Oh, Dext.
I'm such an unholy mess of a girl.
Well, that's no good. That's not even conversation.
But never in my life not if I live to be 100, will I forget how you tried to stand me on my feet again today.
Oh, you? You're in great shape.
Tell me, what did you think of my wedding present?
I like my presents at least acknowledged.
It was beautiful.
And sweet, Dext.
Yes, yeah.
She was quite a boat, the True Love, wasn't she?
Was and is.
My, she was yare.
She was yare, all right.
I wasn't, was I?
Not very.
Oh, you were good at the brightwork, though.
I made her shine.
Where is she now?
I'm gonna sell it to Ruth Watress.
You're going to sell the True Love?
For money?
Sure.
To that fat old rum pot? - Oh, well, what does it matter?
When you're through with a boat, you're through.
Besides, it was only comfortable for two people.
Unless you want her.
No. No, I don't want her.
Well, I'm designing another one anyway, along more practical lines.
What will you call her?
I thought the True Love II. What do you think?
If you call any boat that, I promise I'll blow you and it out of the water.
I'll tell you what you can call her.
In fond remembrance of me.
The Easy Virtue.
Shut up, Red. I can't have you thinking things like that.
What am I supposed to think when I...?
Oh, I don't know.
I don't know anything anymore.
That sounds very hopeful, Red.
That sounds just fine.
Tracy?
We're almost ready.
Stand up, dear. Turn around.
Oh, yes, it's lovely. I'm glad we decided against...
You shouldn't be here.
Against the blue one, dear. Now, no games, Dexter.
George will be right over. I just phoned. Here's a note he sent this morning.
Oh, dear, doesn't everything look lovely?
Dr. Parsons.
Tracy?
Mr. Kittredge hasn't arrived yet, Dr. Parsons.
I want you to meet Tracy's grandmother.
Now, Tracy, don't sit down again until after the ceremony.
Dexter, they phoned from your house that a Mr. Kidd was there.
I was to tell you that he's reading it. Whatever on earth does that mean?
I have a feeling it won't be so hard for me to resign now.
And belts will be worn tighter this winter.
Well, Red, I'm afraid it's the deadline.
So is this. Listen:
I want you to know you will always be my friend but your conduct was so shocking to my ideals of womanhood..."
No, don't go. You might as well hear it too.
That my attitude toward you and the prospect of a happy and useful life together has been changed materially.
Your breach of common decency..."
Tracy.
Hello, George.
Tracy, all these people.
It's only a letter from a friend.
They're my friends too.
...certainly entitles me to an explanation before going through with our marriage.
In the light of day, I am sure that you will agree with me.
Otherwise, with profound regrets and all best wishes, yours very sincer..."
Yes, George, I quite agree with you.
In the light of day and the dark of night for richer, for poorer, for better, for worse in sickness and in health, and...
Thank you so very much for your good wishes at this time.
That's all you have to say?
I wish for your sake as well as mine I had an explanation but unfortunately, I've none.
You better just say good riddance, George.
It isn't easy, you know.
I don't see why.
Say something, stupid.
Just wait a minute.
What for?
On the eve of your wedding, an affair.
I agree. I'll tell you again, good riddance to me.
Your attitude is difficult to understand.
Yes, I can see that it would be.
Not necessarily.
You keep out of this.
You forget I am out of it.
Kittredge it may interest you that this so-called affair consisted of two kisses and a swim.
Thanks, Mike, but...
Which I enjoyed, and the memory of which I wouldn't part with for anything.
It's no use, Mike.
After which I placed Tracy on her bed and promptly returned down here to you two, which doubtless you remember.
Doubtless, without a doubt.
You mean that was all there was to it?
I do.
Why? Was I so unattractive?
So distant? So forbidding or something?
This is fine talk too.
I'm asking a question.
You were extremely attractive.
As for distant and forbidding on the contrary, but you also were a little the worse, or better, for wine and there are rules about that.
Thank you, Mike.
I think men are wonderful.
The little dears.
I fail to see the humor in this situation, Miss Imbrie.
I can appreciate that. It was hard for me too, at first.
Oh, Liz, I...
Oh, it's all right.
We all go haywire at times.
And if we don't, maybe we ought to.
Liz...
You see, it really wasn't Tracy at all, Mr. Kittredge.
It was another girl, a Miss Pommery, 1926.
You'd had too much to drink, Tracy.
That seems to be the consensus of opinion.
Will you promise me never to touch the stuff again?
No, George.
I don't believe I will.
There are certain things about that other girl that Miss Pommery, '26, I rather like.
But a man expects his wife...
To behave herself, naturally.
To behave herself naturally.
Sorry.
But if it hadn't been for that drink, all this might not have happened.
Apparently, nothing did.
What made you think it had?
Well, it didn't take much imagination.
Not much, perhaps, but just of a certain kind.
Seems you didn't think well of yourself.
That's the odd thing, George.
I'd have hoped you'd think better of me than I did.
I'm not going to quibble. The evidence was there.
And I was guilty straight off. Until I was proved innocent.
Downright un-American, if you ask me.
Nobody is asking you.
You forgot your hat, Miss Tracy.
Oh, you look lovely, Miss Tracy.
All our very best wishes.
I wish you'd let me know when you invite people to Tracy's weddings.
Why? What happened, darling?
A Mr. Kidd is here, says he knows you.
Sidney Kidd is here himself?
What else did Sidney Kidd have to say?
He sent the strangest message. He said, "Tell Haven he wins. Tell him I'm licked."
Wins what, Dexter?
Well, it's...
Mr. Sidney Kidd's presence here makes the marriage of national importance.
I think it's extremely kind and thoughtful of him.
Come on, Tracy. It must be late.
Let's let bygones be bygones. What do you say?
Yes, and goodbye, George.
I don't understand you.
Please.
Look...
You're too good for me.
You're 100 times too good.
I never...
I'd make you most unhappy, most.
That is, I'd do my best to.
Well, if that's the way you want it.
That's the way it is.
All right.
Possibly, it's just as well.
Yes, I thought you'd finally come to that conclusion.
I've a feeling you had more to do with this than anyone.
Possibly, but you were a great help.
You and your whole rotten class.
Class, my eye.
You're on your way out, the lot of you, and good riddance!
There goes George.
Oh, my sainted aunt!
That welter of faces.
Oh, my, they look solemn.
What am I to do?
Tracy?
Yes, Mike?
Old Parsons, he's never seen Kittredge, has he?
Now, look, I got you into this thing and I'll get you out of it.
Will you marry me, Tracy?
No, Mike.
Thanks, but nope.
I've never asked a girl to marry me before. I've avoided it.
But you've got me all confused now. Why not?
Because I don't think Liz would like it and I'm not sure you would and I'm even a little doubtful about myself.
But I am beholden to you, Mike. I'm most beholden.
But they're in there. They're waiting.
Don't get too conventional all at once, will you? There'll be a reaction.
Cheer up, Red. It'll be all right. You've been got out of jams before.
Been got out of them, did you say?
Certainly. Don't worry, you always have.
Tracy.
Mother...
We've seen George. It's all right, dear.
Your father will make an announcement.
Is there anything special you want me to say?
No, no. I'll say it.
Whatever it is, I'll say it. I won't be got out of anything anymore, thanks.
I...
I...
I...
Hello. Good morning.
Stop that music.
I'm terribly sorry to have kept you waiting but there's been a slight hitch in the proceedings.
I've made a terrible fool of myself, which isn't unusual and my fiancé...
My fiancé that was, that is he thinks we better call it a day, and I quite agree with him.
Peace, it's wonderful.
Dexter, Dexter, what next?
Two years ago, I did you out of a wedding by eloping to Maryland."
Two years ago, you were invited...
Now, dear, just a loan. Here, put this ring in your vest pocket.
Don't have a vest.
Then hold it in your hand.
Which was bad manners."
Which was bad manners.
I hope to make it up to you by going through with it now."
But I hope to make it up to you by...
By going beautifully through with it now as originally and most beautifully planned.
So if you'll keep your seats..."
So if you'll keep your seats...
That's all.
That's all.
Are you sure?
I'll risk it. Will you?
You bet.
You didn't do it to soften the blow or save my face?
It's a nice little face.
I'll be yare now. I'll promise.
Be whatever you like. Are you all set?
All set.
Best man?
Honored, C.K.
Maid of honor?
Matron of honor. Remember Joe Smith.
Oh, how did this ever happen?
Better tell Mr. Dutton to start the music.
This can't be happening. It can't. But come with me.
Let's get in there. Got the ring?
Yeah. We look like stowaways.
See you soon, Red.
See you soon, Dext.
Tracy, darling.
I love you, Father.
I love you too, Tracy.
Never have I been so full of love before.
Come along. Come along.
Wait. How do I look?
Like a queen. Like a goddess.
And you know how I feel?
How?
Like a human. Like a human being.
Do you know how I feel?
Proud.
I did it. I did it all.
I feel as though I lived through all this before in another life.
When you wish upon a star Makes no difference who you are
Anything your heart desires Will come to you
If your heart is in your dream No request is too extreme
When you wish upon a star
Fate is kind She brings to those who love
The sweet fulfillment of Their secret longing
Like a bolt out of the blue
Fate steps in And sees you through
When you wish upon a star
Your dreams Come true
Pretty.
I'll bet a lot of you folks don't believe that, about a wish coming true, do you?
Well, I didn't either.
Of course, I'm just a cricket singing my way from hearth to hearth, but let me tell you what made me change my mind.
One night a long time...
Pardon me. Wait till I fix this thing. There.
One night a long time ago, my travels took me to a quaint little village.
It was a beautiful night. The stars were shining like diamonds, high above the roofs of that sleepy old town.
Pretty as a picture.
As I wandered along the crooked streets, there wasn't a soul to be seen.
The only sign of life was a lighted window in the shop of a wood-carver named Geppetto.
So I hopped over and looked in.
It was a shame to see a nice cheerful fire like that going to waste.
So what do I do?
I go in!
I looked around.
Of course, being in a strange place like that, I didn't know what to expect.
A cricket can't be too careful, you know.
Soon as I saw there was no one about, I made myself at home.
As I stood there warming my... ...myself, I took a look around.
Well, sir, you never saw such a place.
The most fantastic clocks you ever laid your eyes on, and all carved out of wood.
And cute little music boxes, each one a work of art.
And shelf after shelf of toys and...
And then something else caught my eye. A puppet!
You know, one of those marionette things, all strings and joints.
Cute little fellow.
Going up?
Good piece of wood too.
Well, now, it won't take much longer.
Just a little more paint and he's all finished.
I think he'll be all right. Don't you, Figaro?
Beg pardon.
See? That makes a big difference.
Very good.
Very, very good.
Well, you can't please everybody.
Now I have just the name for you.
Pinocchio!
Do you like it, Figaro?
No?
You do, don't you, Cleo?
Well, we'll leave it to little woodenhead.
Do you like it?
That settles it! Pinocchio it is!
Come on, now, we'll try you out.
Music, Professor!
Take it easy there! Break it up, will you?
Lotta down beats in there.
Little woodenhead go play your part
Bring a little joy to every heart
Little do you know and yet it's true
That I'm mighty proud of you
Little wooden feet and best of all
Little wooden seat in case you fall How graceful!
My little woodenhead
Cleo, meet Pinocchio. Say, "How do you do?"
Say hello to Figaro.
Up to mischief already.
You see what happens?
Up we go!
You're a cute little fellow. And that smile! You know, I...
You rascal!
Jealous?
You know, Pinocchio, I think Figaro is jealous of you.
Don't worry, Figaro. I sti...
I wonder what time it is?
It's getting late.
Come now. We go to bed.
Good night, Pinocchio.
Little funny face.
Good night, Cleo, my little water baby.
Figaro you say good night too.
Go on!
Now go to sleep, my little mermaid. Good night.
This is my idea of comfort.
Solid comfort.
Look at him, Figaro.
He almost looks alive!
Wouldn't it be nice if he was a real boy?
Oh, well. Come on.
We go to sleep.
Oh, Figaro.
I forgot to open the window.
Figaro, look, look, the wishing star!
Star light, star bright, first star I see tonight,
I wish I may, I wish I might, have the wish I make tonight.
Figaro, you know what I wished?
I wished that my little Pinocchio might be a real boy.
Wouldn't that be nice? Just think.
A real boy.
A very lovely thought, but not at all practical.
A real boy.
Quiet!
After all, enough's enough.
Now what's up?
Hey, what's going on here?
As I live and breathe, a fairy!
Good Geppetto, you have given so much happiness to others.
You deserve to have your wish come true.
Little puppet made of pine, wake.
The gift of life is thine.
What they can't do these days.
I can move!
I can talk!
I can walk!
Yes, Pinocchio, I've given you life.
Why?
Because, tonight, Geppetto wished for a real boy.
Am I a real boy?
No, Pinocchio. To make Geppetto's wish come true will be entirely up to you.
Up to me?
Prove yourself brave, truthful and unselfish, and someday you will be a real boy.
A real boy!
That won't be easy.
You must learn to choose - between right and wrong.
Right and wrong?
But how will I know?
How'll he know!
Your conscience will tell you.
What are conscience?
What are conscience!
I'll tell ya!
A conscience is that still, small voice that people won't listen to.
That's just the trouble with the world today.
Are you my conscience?
Would you like to be Pinocchio's conscience?
Well...
Very well. What is your name?
Cricket's the name. Jiminy Cricket.
Kneel, Mr. Cricket.
No tricks now.
I dub you Pinocchio's conscience.
Lord high keeper of the knowledge of right and wrong, counselor in moments of temptation and guide along the straight and narrow path.
Arise, Sir Jiminy Cricket.
Well! My, my!
Say, that's pretty swell.
Gee, thanks!
But don't I get a badge or somethin'?
Well, we'll see.
You mean, maybe I will?
I shouldn't wonder.
Make it a gold one?
Now remember, Pinocchio, be a good boy.
And always let your conscience be your guide.
Goodbye, milady.
Goodbye.
Not bad, says I.
Oh, yeah!
Almost forgot about you.
Well, Pinoke...
Maybe you and I had better have a little heart-to-heart talk.
Why?
Well, you want to be a real boy, don't you?
All right, sit down, son.
Now, you see, the world is full of temptations.
Temptations? - Yep!
Temptations.
They're the wrong things that seem right at the time, but even though the right things may seem wrong sometimes, sometimes the wrong things may be right at the wrong time, or vice versa.
Understand?
But I'm gonna do right.
Attaboy, Pinoke, and I'm gonna help ya.
And anytime you need me, you know, just whistle.
Like this.
No, no. Try it again, Pinoke.
Like this?
No, son. Now listen!
That's it! Come on, now.
Let's sing it!
When you get in trouble and you don't know right from wrong
Give a little whistle Give a little whistle
When you meet temptation and the urge is very strong
Give a little whistle
Give a little whistle
Not just a little squeak Pucker up and blow
And if your whistle's weak, yell
Jiminy Cricket?
Take the straight and narrow path And if you start to slide give a little whistle
Give a little whistle
And always let your conscience be your guide
Take the straight and narrow path And if you start to slide
Give a little whistle
Give a little whistle
And always let your conscience be your guide
And always let your conscience be your guide
Who is there?
It's me.
Oh, it's me.
Figaro.
There's somebody in here.
Careful now, Figaro.
He might spring out on us at any time.
He's in here somewhere.
Here I am!
Pinocchio!
How did you get down here?
I fell down.
Oh, you did.
You are talking.
No, no, no! - Yes!
And I can move too!
No, no, you can't! I'm dreaming in my sleep!
Wake me up! Wake me up!
Now we see who's dreaming.
Go on... say something.
Gee, you're funny. - Do it again!
You do talk!
Yes! The blue fairy came.
The blue fairy?
And I got a conscience.
A conscience!
And, someday, I'm gonna be a real boy.
A real boy!
It is my wish, it's come true!
Figaro, look! He's alive, he can talk!
Say hello to Figaro.
Hello to Figaro.
Oh, Cleo! I almost forgot. Look, it's Pinocchio!
She's my little water baby. Isn't she cute?
Yeah, cute!
This calls for a celebration!
Music!
You start one, Pinocchio.
A party! Mind if I cut in?
How 'bout sitting out the next one, babe?
Lemme out! Lemme out!
Come, Cleo, join the party! Dance!
Nice!
Gathering toys
For my little boy
Look... pretty!
Help!
Where's the bucket?
Help! Water! - Water!
I got it! Here's water. Here's some water.
Help!
Where's water?
That was close.
Maybe we'd better go to bed before something else happens.
Little man, you've had a busy night.
Now, close your eyes and go to sleep.
Why?
Everybody has to sleep.
Figaro goes to sleep, and Cleo.
And, besides, tomorrow you've got to go to school.
Why?
Oh, to learn things... - ...and get smart.
Why?
Because.
Look, Father. Look! - Wait!
Stand still now.
What are those?
Oh, those!
They are your schoolmates, girls and boys. Now get in.
Real boys? - Yes!
But hurry now. Wait, wait, wait!
Wait, wait.
Here's an apple for the teacher. Now turn around and let me look you over.
Yeah, yeah. Here. Run along now.
Wait, wait. Come back here, Figaro.
School is not for you.
Goodbye, Father!
Goodbye, son. Hurry back.
Gideon, listen.
The merry laughter of little innocent children wending their way to school.
Thirsty little minds rushing to the fountain of knowledge.
School, a noble institution.
What would this stupid world be without...
Well, well, well!
Stromboli! So that old rascal's back in town?
Remember, Giddy, the time I tied strings on you and passed you off as a puppet?
We nearly put one over on that old gypsy that time!
A little wooden boy.
A wooden boy!
Look, Giddy, look. it's amazing.
A live puppet without strings.
A thing like that ought to be worth a fortune to someone.
Now let me see. That's it!
Stromboli!
Why, that fat, old faker would give his... Listen.
If we play our cards right, we'll be on easy street, or my name isn't Honest John.
Quick! We'll head him off.
Now's our...
No, no, stupid.
Don't be crude.
Let me handle this.
Here he comes.
Yes, Giddy, as I was saying to the duchess only yesterday...
How clumsy of me!
My, my, my.
I'm terribly sorry.
I do hope you're not injured.
I'm all right.
Splendid!
Well, well. Quite a scholar, I see.
Look, Giddy, a man of letters.
Here's your book.
I'm going to school.
School!
Ah, yes. Then you haven't heard of the easy road to success.
No?
I'm speaking, my boy, of the theater!
Here's your apple.
Bright lights, music, applause! - Fame!
Fame?
Yes! And with that personality, that profile, that physique...
Why, he's a natural born actor. - But I'm going...
Straight to the top.
Why, I can see your name in lights, lights six feet high.
What is your name?
Pinocchio.
Pinocchio!
P-l-N-U-O... P-l...
We're wasting precious time.
Come. On to the theater!
Hi diddle dee dee An actor's life for me
A high silk hat and a silver cane
A watch of gold with a diamond chain
Hi diddle de day An actor's life is gay
It's great to be a celebrity
An actor's life for me
Fine conscience I turned out to be! Late the first day.
Oh, well, he can't get in much trouble between here and school.
Oh, boy, a parade! An actor's life for me
Hi diddle de dee An actor's life for me
A waxed moustache and a beaver coat A pony cart and a billy goat Why, it's... it's Pinoke! Hey, where you going?
Wait! - You ride around in a coach and four
You stop and buy out a candy store - Halt! - An actor's life for me
With clothes that come from the finest shop
What was that?
It's Jiminy!
Whatcha doin' up there?
Who? What? Jiminy?
Up where?
My boy, you must be seeing things.
Oh, no, that's my conscience. He...
Now, now, now. Just calm down.
Why, there's nothing up there to be afraid of.
Pinoke...
Over here.
Over here.
Jiminy, I'm gonna be an actor!
All right, son. Take it easy now.
Remember what I said about temptation?
Well, that's him.
Oh, no, Jiminy. - That's Mr. Honest John!
Honest John?
Get me outta here!
All right then, here's what we'll tell 'em.
You can't go to the theater. Say, "Thank you just the same."
You're sorry, but you've got to go to school.
Pinocchio? Here they come, Pinoke.
Now you tell 'em.
Oh, little boy! There you are! Where were we?
Yes... on to the theater!
Goodbye, Jiminy, goodbye!
Hi diddle dee dee An actor's life for me - Goodbye? Pinoke, you can't go!
A high silk hat and a silver cane - There he goes.
A watch of gold with a diamond chain
What'll I do?
I'll run and tell his father. No, that'd be snitching.
I'll go after him myself.
Ladies and gentlemen, to conclude the performance of this great show,
Stromboli, the master showman... That's me.
...and by special permission of the management... That's me too.
...is presenting to you something you will absolutely refuse to believe!
Well, looks like a sellout.
Introducing the only marionette who can sing and dance absolutely without the aids of strings.
I hope so.
The one... and only... Pinocchio!
What a buildup.
I got no strings to hold me do...
Go ahead... make a fool of yourself!
Then, maybe, you'll listen to your conscience.
Cute kid.
I got no strings to hold me down To make me fret or make me frown
I had strings, but now I'm free There are no strings on me
Heigh ho the merry-o That's the only way to be
I want the world to know Nothing ever worries me I got no strings...
What I told you?
They got strings, but you can see There are no strings on me
You have no strings Your arms is free To love me by the Zuider Zee
Ya-ya-ya if you would woo I'd bust my strings for you
You've got no strings Comme ci comme ça Your savoir faire is ooo-la-la
I've got strings, but entre nous I'd cut my strings for you
Down where the Volga flows There's a Russian rendezvous Where me and Ivan go but I'd rather go with you
There are no strings on me
They like him. He's a success.
Maybe I was wrong.
Well, guess he won't need me anymore.
What does an actor want with a conscience anyway?
What could have happened to him?
Where could he be at this hour?
I'd better go out again and look for him.
And, remember, nobody eats a bite until I find him.
I buy a new suit and I swing the cane I eat the best and I drink champagne
I got no strings on me
Bravo, Pinocchio!
They liked me!
Two hundred. - You are sensational!
You mean I'm good?
Three hundred.
You are colossal!
Does that mean I'm an actor? Sure!
I will push you in the public's eye.
Your face, she will be on everybody's tongue.
Will she?
What's this?
For you, my little Pinocchio.
For me?
Gee, thanks!
I'll run right home and tell my father.
Home?
Oh, sure. Going home to your father.
That is very "comeecal."
You mean, it's funny?
Oh, sure! Yes.
I'll be back in the morning.
Be back in the morning!
Going home?
There, this will be your home...
Where I can find you always!
No, no, no!
Yes, yes, yes!
To me... you are belonging.
We will tour the world.
Paris. London.
Monte Carlo. "Constantinopolee."
No, no!
Yes! We start tonight!
You will make lots of money... for me!
And when you are growing too old, you will make good firewood!
Let me outta here. I gotta get out! You can't keep me!
Quiet! Shut up!
Before I knock you silly!
Good night, my little wooden gold mine.
No! No, wait! Lemme out!
I'll tell my father!
Giddy up!
Get along there.
Jiminy!
Oh, Jiminy!
Jiminy, where are you?
Jiminy Cricket!
Well, there he goes.
Sitting in the lap of luxury, the world at his feet.
Oh, well, I can always say "I knew him when."
I'll just go out of his life quietly.
I would like to wish him luck though.
Sure! Why not?
Pinocchio?
Pinocchio?
It's me, your old friend, Jiminy. Remember?
Jiminy!
I'm glad to see ya!
Pinocchio, what's happened?
What did he do to ya?
He was mad. He said he was gonna push my face in everybody's eye.
And just 'cause I'm a goldbrick, he's gonna chop me into firewood!
Oh, is that so?
Now, don't you worry, son.
I'll have you outta here in no time at all.
Why, this is just as easy... ...as rolling' off a...
Kinda rusty.
Needs a little oil.
Needs a little oil, needs a little oil. That's what I said.
Must be one of the old models.
You mean, you can't open it?
Yeah.
Looks pretty hopeless.
It'll take a miracle to get us outta here.
Pinocchio? Pinocchio.
Giddy up!
Pino...
A fine conscience I turned out to be.
I shoulda listened to you, Jiminy.
No, it was my fault. I shouldn't have walked out on you.
Guess I'll never see my father again.
Buck up, son. it could be worse.
Be cheerful... like me!
Take it easy, son. Come on, blow.
Attaboy.
Well, it stopped raining anyway. Well, it stopped raining anyway.
Hey, that star again! - The lady!
The fairy!
What'll she say?
What'll I tell her?
You might tell her the truth.
Why, Pinocchio!
Hello!
Sir Jiminy!
Well! This is a pleasant surprise!
Pinocchio, why didn't you go to school?
School? Well, I...
Go ahead, tell her.
I was going to school 'til I met somebody.
Met somebody?
Yeah, two big monsters! With big green eyes.
Why, I... Monsters?
Weren't you afraid?
No, ma'am. But they tied me in a big sack.
You don't say! - And where was Sir Jiminy?
Jiminy?
Leave me outta this.
They put him in a little sack.
No!
Yeah!
How did you escape?
I didn't. They chopped me into firewood!
Oh, look, my nose!
What's happened?
Perhaps you haven't been telling the truth.
Perhaps?
But I have! Every single word!
Please help me. I'm awful sorry.
You see, Pinocchio, a lie keeps growing and growing until it's as plain as the nose on your face.
She's right, Pinoke, you better come clean.
I'll never lie again, honest, I won't.
Please, your honor, I mean... Miss Fairy.
Give him another chance, for my sake. Will ya, huh?
I'll forgive you this once.
But, remember, a boy who won't be good might just as well be made of wood.
We'll be good, won't we?
Very well, but this is the last time I can help you.
Gee, look, Jiminy!
My nose!
Hey, we're free.
Come on, Pinoke.
I buy a new suit and I swing the cane I eat the fish and I drink champagne
Toodle-ooo, Stromboli.
Goodbye, Mr. Stromboli.
Quiet! Let's get outta here before something else happens.
Hi diddle dee dee An actor's life for me
A high silk hat and a silver cane A watch of gold with a diamond chain
Hi diddle dee day An actor's life is gay
It's great to be a celebrity An actor's life for me
And the dummy fell for it.
Hook, line and sinker!
And he still thinks we're his friends!
And did Stromboli pay!
Plenty!
That shows you how low Honest John will stoop.
Eh, Giddy?
Now, Coachman...
What's your proposition?
Well how would you blokes like to make some real money?
Well... and who do we have to...
No, no! Nothing like that. You see...
I'm collecting stupid little boys.
Stupid little boys?
You know, the disobedient ones what play hooky from school.
And you see...
...and I takes 'em to Pleasure Island!
Pleasure Island.
Pleasure Island? But the law, suppose they...
No, no. There is no risk!
They never come back as boys!
Now I've got a coach load leaving at midnight.
We'll meet at the crossroads, and no double-crossing!
No, sir. - Scout around.
Any good prospects you find, bring 'em to me.
Yes, chief. - I'll pay you well.
I got plenty of gold.
Yes, yes. - I got plenty of gold. - Yes, yes.
No, sir, nothing can stop me now.
I'll make good this time.
You'd better!
I will. I'm going to school.
That's the stuff, Pinoke.
I'd rather be smart than be an actor.
Now you're talkin'!
Come on, slowpoke. I'll race ya home.
Well, well, Pinocchio, what's your rush?
I gotta beat Jiminy home. Oh, hello.
Well, how is the great actor?
I don't want to be an actor. - Stromboli was terrible!
He was?
Yeah, he locked me in a bird cage.
He did?
But I learned my lesson. - I'm going...
You poor, poor boy. You must be a nervous wreck.
That's it! You are a nervous wreck.
We must diagnose this case at once.
Quick, doctor, your notebook.
Bless my soul.
Just as I thought.
A slight touch of monetary complications with bucolic semi-lunar contraptions of the flying trapezes.
Say hippopotamus.
I knew it!
Compound transmission of the pandemonium with percussion and spasmodic frantic disintegration!
Close your eyes. What do you see?
Nothing.
Open them. Now what do you see?
Spots!
Now that heart.
My goodness!
A palpitating syncopation of the killer diller with a wicky wacky stomping of the floy joy!
Quick, doctor, that report.
This makes it perfectly clear.
My boy, you are allergic.
Allergic? - Yes!
And there is only one cure.
A vacation on Pleasure Island.
Pleasure Island?
Yes! That happy land of carefree boys where every day is a holiday!
But I can't go. I...
Why, of course you can go.
I'm giving you my ticket.
Here.
Thanks! But I'm...
I insist. Your health comes first.
Come, the coach departs at midnight!
Hi diddle dee dee It's Pleasure Isle for me
Where every day is a holiday And kids have nothing to do but play
Pinoke?
Oh, Pinoke?
Now where do you suppose he...
Pinocchio! Hey, come back.
Giddy up.
Well here we go again.
My name's Lampwick. What's yours? - Pinocchio.
Ever been to Pleasure Island?
But Mr. Honest John gave me...
Me neither, but they say it's a swell joint. No school, no cops.
You can tear the joint apart and nobody says a word.
Honest John gave me...
Loaf around, plenty to eat, plenty to drink.
And it's all free!
Honest John...
Boy, that's the place. I can hardly wait!
Right here, boys! Right here. Get your cake, pie, dill pickles and ice cream.
Eat all you can. Be a glutton.
Stuff yourselves. it's all free, boys. It's all free. Hurry, hurry, hurry.
The rough house, the rough house. It's the roughest, toughest joint ya ever seen.
Come in and pick a fight, boys.
Oh, boy, a scrap!
Come on. Let's go in and poke somebody in the nose.
Why?
Just for the fun of it.
OK, Lampy.
Tobacco Row. Get your cigars, cigarettes and chewing' tobacco.
Come in and smoke your heads off. There's nobody here to stop you.
Pinocchio?
Pinocchio!
There's something phony about all this.
I gotta get him outta here!
Hurry, hurry, hurry! See the model home.
It's open for destruction, and it's all yours, boys! She's all yours.
What'd I tell ya?
Ain't this a swell joint?
Yeah! Being bad's a lot of fun, ain't it?
Yeah. Get a load of that strained-glass window.
All right, now. Hop to it, you blokes.
Come on! Come on!
Shut the doors and lock 'em tight.
Now get below and get them crates ready.
Give a bad boy enough rope and he'll soon make a jackass of himself.
Pinocchio!
Where is everybody?
The place is like a graveyard. I don't like the looks of this.
Pinocchio!
Hey, where are you?
Where do you suppose all the kids went to?
They're around here somewheres. What do you care?
You're havin' a good time, ain't ya?
I sure am. Oh, boy! This is the life, Pinoke.
Yeah!
It sure is!
You smoke like me grandmother!
Come on, take a big drag, like this. OK, Lampy.
Some fun, huh, kid?
OK, Slats, your shot.
What's the matter, Slats?
Losing your grip?
Pinocchio!
So this is where I find you!
How do you ever expect to be a real boy?
Look at yourself...
smoking, playing pool!
You're comin' right home with me this minute!
Hey, who's the beetle?
Let go!
Let me out. - He's my conscience! - He tells me what's right and wrong.
What?
You mean to tell me you take orders from a grasshopper? Grasshopper?
Look here, you impudent young pup!
It wouldn't hurt you to take orders from your grasshop your conscience, if you have one.
Yeah, yeah, sure.
Screwball in the corner pocket.
Why, why... ya young hoodlum!
I'll knock your block off!
I'll take you apart and put you back together!
Don't hurt him. He's my best friend.
Why, I'll... Your best friend?
And what am I?
Just your conscience!
OK, that settles it!
But, Jiminy...
You buttered your bread, now sleep in it!
Go on, laugh. Make a jackass outta yourself.
I'm through! - This is the end. - But Jiminy...
Lampwick says a guy only lives once.
Lampwick...
Come on, come on. Let him go.
Lampwick... Lampwick!
It burns me up.
After all I tried to do for him.
Who's his conscience, anyway?
Me or that hoodlum, Lampwick?
I've had enough of this. I'm taking the next boat out of here.
Open up that door!
Open up! I wanna go home.
Come on, you blokes, keep 'em moving!
Lively there now. We haven't got all night.
Where'd all the donkeys come from?
Come on, come on. Let's have another.
And what's your name?
OK, you'll do!
In you go!
You boys'll bring a nice price.
All right, next!
And what might your name be?
Alexander.
So you can talk!
Yes, sir.
I wanna go home to my mama!
Take him back! He can still talk!
Please, please!
I don't wanna be a donkey.
Let me outta here!
You boys have had your fun. Now pay for it!
Boys?
So that's what... Pinocchio!
To hear that beetle talk... you'd think somethin' was gonna happen to us.
Conscience! Phooey!
Where's he get that stuff?
How do you ever expect to be a real boy?
What's he think I look like?
A jackass?
You sure do!
Hey, you laugh like a donkey.
Did that come outta me?
What the... What's going on?
I've been double-crossed! Help! Help!
Somebody, help! I've been framed! Help!
Please, you gotta help me. Be a pal.
Call that beetle. Call anybody.
Mama? Mama!
What's happened?
I hope I'm not too late.
What'll I do?
Pinocchio!
Jiminy! Oh, Jiminy, help!
Pinoke, the kids, the boys, they're all donkeys!
You too.
Come on, quick! Before you get any worse.
This way, Pinoke. It's the only way out.
Hurry up before they see us.
You gotta jump!
Jiminy...
Jiminy, you all right?
Sure!
I thought we'd never make it.
Certainly feels good to be back on dry land.
Come on, let's get home.
Father, Father, I'm home! - We're home, Mr. Geppetto.
Home again. It's me, Pinocchio!
I'm home to stay.
Here he is, Mr. Geppetto. Home at last.
Hey, maybe he's asleep.
Father?
Father, it's me.
Pinoke, come here.
He ain't here. - He...
He's gone.
Yeah, and Figaro.
And Cleo too.
Maybe something awful happened to him.
Don't worry, son, he probably hasn't gone far.
Hey!
It's a message.
What's it say?
It's about your father.
Where is he?
Why, it says here he went looking for you and he was swallowed by a whale.
Swallowed by a whale?
A whale?
A whale named Monstro.
But wait, he's alive.
Alive? Where?
Why, inside the whale at the bottom of the sea.
Bottom of the sea?
Hey, where you going?
I'm going to find him.
Pinoke, are you crazy?
Don't you realize he's in a whale?
I've gotta go to him.
Hey, Pinoke, wait! Listen here, son...
But this Monstro, I've heard of him.
He's a whale of a whale! He swallows whole ships alive!
Tie it good and tight now.
And, besides, it's dangerous.
Bye, Jiminy.
Goodbye?
I may be live bait down there, but I'm with ya.
Come on... let's go.
Look out below!
Gangway, down there.
What a big place.
Come on, Jiminy.
All right. Soon as I take on some ballast.
One side, sister.
Well... so long.
Put it in the wrong end.
No more privacy than a goldfish.
Chilly.
Father?
Father?
Hey, Pinoke, wait for me!
Father?
He ain't my father.
Mr. Geppetto!
Hey, let go!
Run along, you little... squirt.
What's the matter? Can't a fellow... I was only...
We were only looking for Monstro.
That got 'em.
Father?
Father?
Hello.
Can you tell me where we can find Monstro, the whale?
Gee! They're scared.
Pardon me, pearl, are you acquainted with Monstro, the whale?
Hold it there.
Father?
One side there, son. Come on, boys, break it up.
Break it up now.
What the... Whoa, quit shoving'.
Don't crowd.
Take it easy there.
Steady there, Nellie.
Go ahead, Pinoke, ask them.
Could any of you tell me where to find Monstro?
Sakes alive.
Father?
Father?
Mr. Geppetto?
Not a bite for days.
We can't hold out much longer.
I never thought...
it would end this way, Figaro.
Starving to death in the belly of a whale.
My poor little Pinocchio.
He was such a good boy.
It's hopeless, Figaro.
There isn't a fish left.
If the monster doesn't wake up soon,
I'm afraid we... we are done for.
Here they come!
Tuna!
Oh, tuna fish!
Food! We'll eat!
Here's a big one.
Keep them in there, Figaro. Wait!
Wait a minute! Have you seen...
Monstro!
We gotta get outta here.
Come on, Pinoke.
Don't wait for me!
Never saw so many!
Here's another one.
Enough for weeks!
Here's a big one.
Keep them in there, Figaro!
Hey, blubber mouth, open up. I gotta get in there.
Looks like the last of them.
Here's a big one. Only a few left.
We gotta work fast.
Hey!
Here's another one.
Hey, Father!
Father!
Don't bother me now, Pinocchio.
Pinocchio!
Father!
Pinocchio, my son!
Hey, Father, here I am.
Oh, yes! Pinocchio, my boy! - I'm so happy to see you.
Me too, Father.
Figaro! Figaro.
Cleo!
Oh, Cleo! - You're here too.
Yes! We're all together again.
You are soaking wet. - Yes, Father.
You mustn't catch cold.
But I came to save you.
You know, you shouldn't have come down here.
But, Father.
But I'm awfully glad to see you.
Let me take your hat.
Pinocchio!
What's the matter?
Those ears!
Ears?
Oh, these!
That's nothing. I got a tail, too!
Pinocchio!
What's happened to you?
Well, I... I... - I...
Never mind now. Old Geppetto has his little woodenhead.
Nothing else matters!
I gotta get in!
My pal's in there.
Come on, ya big moose! Open up, I tell ya!
Hey!
Cut it out.
Hey, beat it, you buzzards!
Get out?
Oh, no, no, son.
I have tried every way. Why, I even built a raft.
A raft?
That's it!
We'll take the raft and when the whale opens his mouth...
No, no, no, no. Now, listen, son.
He only opens his mouth when he's eating.
Then everything comes in, nothing goes out.
It's hopeless, Pinocchio.
Come, we make a nice fire and we cook some of the fish. - A fire!
That's it!
Yes!
And then we'll all eat again.
A great big fire! Lots of smoke.
Smoke?
Yes, sure. - A smoked fish will taste good. - Quick, some wood.
Pinocchio, not the chair.
Hurry, Father, more wood!
What'll we sit on?
We won't need it. We're getting out!
Getting out?
But how?
We'll make him sneeze!
Make him sneeze?
That will make him mad!
Well, it's about time!
It won't work.
Hurry, Father. Climb aboard.
We'll never get by those teeth!
Yes, we will!
Hey, which way are you going?
Wait for me!
Hang on. Here we go!
Gesundheit.
We're going back!
No, we'll make it. Faster, faster!
It's no use.
We're done for!
We made it!
Look! Now he is mad!
I told you he'd be furious!
He's gone.
Where'd he go?
Look out!
Hang on!
He's coming back. Hurry!
He's trying to kill us! Paddle, son!
Let's go back!
Look out! Jump!
Father? Father?
Oh, Father!
Pinocchio, swim for shore. Swim for shore.
Hang on, Father.
Save... yourself.
Pinocchio... save yourself.
Don't mind me, son.
Save yourself... Pinocchio.
Pinocchio!
Oh, Pinocchio!
Pino...
My boy!
My brave little boy.
Prove yourself brave, truthful and unselfish and someday you will be a real boy.
Awake, Pinocchio. Awake.
Father, whatcha cryin' for?
Because... you're dead, Pinocchio. No!
No, I'm not!
Yes, yes you are.
Now lie down.
But, Father, I'm alive.
See? And I'm... I'm...
I'm a real boy!
You're alive and...
and you are a real boy!
A real live boy.
This calls for a celebration!
Professor, lots of music!
This is practically where I came in.
Thank you, milady.
He deserved to be a real boy.
It sure was nice of you to...
Well, I'll be!
My, my!
Solid gold too.
I think it's swell!
When your heart is in your dream
No request Is too extreme
When you wish Upon a star
Your dreams Come true
Last night, I dreamt I went to Manderley again.
It seemed to me I stood by the iron gate leading to the drive, and for a while, I could not enter, for the way was barred to me.
Then, like all dreamers,
I was possessed of a sudden with supernatural powers and passed like a spirit through the barrier before me.
The drive wound away in front of me, twisting and turning as it had always done.
But as I advanced, I was aware that a change had come upon it.
Nature had come into her own again, and little by little had encroached upon the drive with long, tenacious fingers.
On and on wound the poor thread that had once been our drive, and finally, there was Manderley.
Manderley, secretive and silent.
Time could not mar the perfect symmetry of those walls.
Moonlight can play odd tricks upon the fancy, and suddenly it seemed to me that light came from the windows.
And then a cloud came upon the moon and hovered an instant like a dark hand before a face.
The illusion went with it.
I looked upon a desolate shell with no whisper of the past about its staring walls.
We can never go back to Manderley again.
That much is certain.
But sometimes in my dreams, I do go back to the strange days of my life which began for me in the South of France.
No! Stop!
What the devil are you shouting about?
Who are you?
What are you staring at?
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to stare, but I... I only thought...
Oh, you did, did you? Well, what are you doing here?
I was only walking.
Well, get on with your walking. Don't hang about here screaming.
I'll never come to Monte Carlo out of season again.
Not a single well-known personality in the hotel.
Stone cold. Waiter!
Garcon! Call him.
Tell him to get me some...
Why, it's Max de Winter.
How do you do?
I'm Edythe Van Hopper.
It's so nice to run into you here, just when I was beginning to despair of finding any old friends here in Monte.
But do sit down and have some coffee.
Mr. De Winter is having some coffee with me. Go and ask that stupid waiter for another cup.
I'm afraid I must contradict you. You shall both have coffee with me.
Garcon. Coffee, please.
Cigarette?
No, thank you.
You know, I recognized you as soon as you came in, though I haven't seen you since that night at the casino at Palm Beach.
Perhaps you don't remember an old woman like me.
Are you playing the tables much here at Monte? No.
I'm afraid that sort of thing ceased to amuse me years ago.
I can well understand that. As for me, if I had a home like Manderley,
I should certainly never come to Monte.
I hear it's one of the biggest places in that part of the country, and you just can't beat it for beauty.
What do you think of Monte Carlo? Or don't you think of it at all?
Well, I think it's rather artificial.
She's spoiled, Mr. De Winter, that's her trouble.
Most girls will give their eyes for a chance to see Monte.
Wouldn't that rather defeat the purpose?
Now that we've found each other again, I hope I shall see something of you.
You must come and have a drink in my suite.
I hope they've given you a good room.
The place is empty, so if you're uncomfortable, mind you make a fuss.
Your valet has unpacked for you, I suppose?
I'm afraid I don't possess one. Perhaps you would like to do it for me?
Well, I... I hardly think...
Perhaps you could make yourself useful to Mr. De Winter if he wants anything done.
You're a capable child in many ways.
That's a charming suggestion, but I'm afraid I cling to the old motto,
He travels fastest who travels alone. " Perhaps you've not heard it.
Good night.
What do you make of that?
Do you suppose that sudden departure was intended to be funny?
Come, don't sit there gawking, let's go upstairs.
Have you got the key?
Yes, Mrs. Van Hopper.
I remember, when I was younger, there was a well-known writer who used to dart down the back way whenever he saw me coming.
I suppose he was in love with me and wasn't quite sure of himself.
Well, c'est la vie.
By the way, my dear, don't think that I mean to be unkind, but you were just a teeny-weeny bit forward with Mr. De Winter.
Your effort to enter the conversation quite embarrassed me, and I'm sure it did him.
Men loathe that sort of thing.
Oh, come, don't sulk.
After all, I am responsible for your behavior here.
Perhaps he didn't notice it.
Poor thing, I suppose he just can't get over his wife's death.
They say he simply adored her.
Oh... How awkward of me.
What a stupid thing to do. Oh, I'm so sorry. Please don't bother.
It doesn't really matter.
No, leave that, leave that. Go and lay another place at my table.
Mademoiselle will have lunch with me.
Oh, but I couldn't possibly. - Why not?
Oh, well, please don't be polite.
I...
It's very kind of you but I'll be all right if they just change the cloth.
I wasn't being polite. I should have asked you to have lunch with me even if you hadn't upset the vase so clumsily.
Come along.
We needn't talk to each other if we don't feel like it.
Well, thank you very much.
Oh, I... I'll just have some scrambled eggs.
Oui, mademoiselle.
What's happened to your friend?
She's ill in bed with a cold.
I'm sorry I was so rude to you yesterday.
The only excuse I can offer is that I've become boorish through living alone.
You weren't really. You simply wanted to be alone and...
Tell me, is Mrs. Van Hopper a friend of yours or just a relation?
No, she's my employer. I'm what is known as "a paid companion. "
I didn't know companionship could be bought.
I looked at the word "companion" in the dictionary once.
It said, "a friend of the bosom. "
I don't envy you the privilege.
Well, she's very kind, really, and I have to earn my living.
Haven't you any family?
No.
My mother died years and years ago, and there was only my father, and he died last summer.
And then I took this job.
How rotten for you.
Yes, it was rather, because, you see, we got on so well together.
You and your father?
Yes. He was a lovely person, very unusual. - What was he?
A painter.
Ah!
Was he a good one?
Well, I thought so, but people didn't understand him.
Yes, that's often the trouble.
He painted trees. At least, it was one tree.
You mean, he painted the same tree over and over again? Yes.
You see, he had a theory that if you should find one perfect thing or place or person, you should stick to it.
Do you think that's really silly?
Not at all. I'm a firm believer in that myself.
And what did you find to do with yourself while he was painting his tree?
Well, I sat with him and I sketched a little. I don't do it very well, though.
Were you going sketching this afternoon? Yes.
Where?
Well, I haven't made up my mind.
I'll drive you somewhere in the car.
Oh, no, please, I didn't mean... Oh, nonsense.
Finish up that mess, and we'll get along.
Thank you. It's very kind of you, but I'm not very hungry.
Come on. Eat it up like a good girl.
You've taken long enough for that sketch. I shall expect a really fine work of art.
Oh, no, don't look at it. It's not nearly good enough.
Well, it can't be as bad as all that. Now don't rub it all out.
Let me see it first.
Well, it's the perspective.
I never can get it right.
Let me see it, let me see it.
Oh, dear.
Tell me, is it the perspective that gives my nose that curious twist in the middle?
Well, you're not a very easy subject to sketch. Your...
Your expression keeps changing all the time.
Well, I'd... I'd concentrate on the view instead, if I were you.
Much more worthwhile.
It rather reminds me of our coastline at home.
Do you know Cornwall at all?
Yes, I went there once with my father on holiday.
I was in a shop once, and I saw a postcard with a beautiful house on it, right by the sea.
I asked whose house it was, and the old lady said, "That's Manderley. "
I felt ashamed for not knowing.
Manderley is beautiful.
But to me, it's just the place where I was born, and have lived in all my life.
But now, I don't suppose I shall ever see it again.
We're lucky not to be home during the bad weather, aren't we?
I can't ever remember enjoying swimming in England till June, can you?
The water's so warm here that I could stay in all day.
There's a dangerous undertow and there was a man drowned here last year.
I never have any fear of drowning. Have you?
Come, I'll take you home.
Oh, yes, I know Mr. De Winter well. I knew his wife, too.
Before she married, she was the beautiful Rebecca Hildreth, you know.
She was drowned, poor dear, while she was sailing near Manderley.
He never talks about it, of course, but he's a broken man.
I suppose I'd better have it.
Wretched stuff!
Give me a chocolate, quick!
Oh, there you are. It's about time.
Hurry up. I want to play some rummy.
She was the beautiful Rebecca Hildreth, you know.
They say he simply adored her.
She was the beautiful Rebecca Hildreth, you know.
I suppose he just can't get over his wife's death.
She was the beautiful Rebecca Hildreth, you know.
But he's a broken man.
Bonjour.
Well, where are you going?
I thought I'd take a tennis lesson.
I see.
I suppose you've had a look at the pro, and he's desperately handsome, and you've conceived a schoolgirl crush on him.
All right. Go ahead. Make the most of it.
Off duty?
Well, yes. Mrs. Van Hopper's cold's turned into flu, so she's got a trained nurse.
I'm sorry for the nurse. You keen on tennis?
Well, not particularly.
That's good.
Good afternoon, Mrs. Van Hopper. How are you feeling?
You got on rather well with him, didn't you?
That pro must have been teaching you other things than tennis.
Hurry up, I want you to make some calls.
I wonder if Mr. De Winter is still in the hotel.
May I go now?
For the number of lessons you've had, you ought to be ready for Wimbledon.
But this will be your last, so make the most of it.
The trouble is, with me laid up like this, you haven't had enough to do.
I'm getting rid of that nurse today. And from now on, you'll stick to your job.
Yes, Mrs. Van Hopper.
Nurse?
Yes, Mrs. Hopper?
Are you absolutely sure you left those messages for Mr. De Winter?
Why, yes, madame.
I simply can't believe it.
He would most certainly have called me back.
Oh, well. Poor boy, I simply hate to see him so alone.
You know, I...
I wish there could be an invention that bottled up the memory, like perfume, and it never faded, never got stale.
Then whenever I wanted to, I could uncork the bottle and live the memory all over again.
And what particular moment in your young life would you want to keep?
All of them. All these last few days.
I feel as though I'd... I'd collected a whole shelf full of bottles.
Sometimes, you know, those little bottles contain demons that have a way of popping out at you, just as you're trying most desperately to forget.
Stop biting your nails.
I wish I were a woman of 36, dressed in black satin with a string of pearls.
You wouldn't be here with me if you were.
Would you please tell me, Mr. De Winter, why you asked me to come out with you?
It's obvious you want to be kind, but why do you choose me for your charity?
I asked you to come out with me because I wanted your company.
You've blotted out the past for me more than all the bright lights of Monte Carlo.
But if you think I just asked you out of kindness or charity, you can leave the car now and find your own way home.
Go on. Open the door and get out.
Better blow your nose.
Please don't call me Mr. De Winter.
I have a very impressive array of first names.
George Fortescue Maximilian.
You needn't bother with them all at once.
And another thing, please promise me never to wear black satin or pearls, or to be 36 years old.
Yes, Maxim.
For the love of Pete!
Come here!
My daughter's engaged to be married.
Oh, really? How nice!
We must leave for New York at once.
Get reservations on the Aquitania, and we'll take the 12:30 train for Cherbourg.
Hurry up and get me the maid to help with the packing. We've no time to waste.
Go on and don't dawdle.
Mr. De Winter, please.
He's gone out riding?
He won't be back till noon?
Give me the porter, please.
I'll go and see if there's anything left in my room.
Has Mr. De Winter come in yet?
Oh, he has?
Would you connect me, please?
I was looking for my book.
I suppose I've packed it.
Well, come on, the car's waiting at the door.
I'd like to leave a forwarding address, if they happen to find that book.
Would you ring Mr. De Winter, please?
Yes, madame.
There isn't any answer.
Thank you.
Tell her to hurry up!
Yes, madame.
I was looking for Mr. De Winter.
Mr. De Winter just ordered breakfast in his room, mademoiselle.
Come in.
What are you doing here?
Anything the matter?
I've come to say goodbye. We're going away.
What on Earth are you talking about?
It's true.
We're going now, and I was afraid I wouldn't see you again.
Where's she taking you to?
New York.
I don't want to go. I shall hate it.
I shall be miserable.
I'll dress in here.
I shan't be long.
Which would you prefer, New York or Manderley?
Oh, please don't joke about it.
Mrs. Van Hopper's waiting.
I'd better say goodbye now.
I'll repeat what I said.
Either you go to America with Mrs. Van Hopper, or you come home to Manderley with me.
You mean you want a secretary or something?
I'm asking you to marry me, you little fool.
Come in.
Is that my food? I'm famished. I didn't have any breakfast.
My suggestion didn't seem to go at all well.
Sorry.
Oh, but you don't understand. It's the...
I'm not the sort of person men marry.
What on Earth do you mean?
I don't belong in your sort of world, for one thing.
Well, what is my sort of world?
Well, Manderley. You know what I mean.
Well, I'm the best judge of whether you belong there or not.
Of course, if you don't love me, that's a different thing.
Fine blow to my conceit, that's all.
I do love you.
I love you most dreadfully.
I've been crying all morning because I thought I'd never see you again.
Bless you for that.
I'll remind you of this one day and you won't believe me.
It's a pity you have to grow up.
Well, now that's settled. You may pour me out some coffee.
Two lumps of sugar and some milk, please.
Same with my tea, don't forget.
Who is going to break the news to Mrs. Van Hopper? Shall you or should I?
You tell her. She'll be so angry.
What's the number of her room?
She's not there. She's downstairs in the car.
Hello.
Give me the desk, please.
Hello.
You'll find Mrs. Van Hopper waiting outside in her car.
Would you ask her, with my compliments, if she'd very kindly come up and see me in my room?
Yes, in my room.
Mr. De Winter says please for you to come up to his room.
Mr. De Winter?
Why, certainly.
This isn't at all your idea of a proposal, is it?
It should be in a conservatory, you in a white frock, with a red rose in your hand, and a violin playing in the distance, and I should be making violent love to you behind a palm tree.
Poor darling.
Never mind. I don't mind.
Don't worry. Don't worry.
You won't have to say a word.
I'm so glad you called me, Mr. De Winter.
I was making a hasty departure. It was so rude of me not to let you know.
But a cable came this morning announcing that my daughter is engaged to be married.
That's rather a coincidence, Mrs. Van Hopper.
I asked you up here in order to tell you of my engagement.
You don't mean it.
How perfectly wonderful.
How romantic. Who is the lucky lady?
I apologize for depriving you of your companion in this abrupt way.
I do hope it won't inconvenience you too greatly.
When did all this happen?
Just now, Mrs. Van Hopper.
Just a few minutes ago.
I simply can't believe it.
And I suppose I ought to scold you for not having breathed a word of all of this to me.
What am I thinking of?
I should give you both my congratulations and my blessings.
I'm very happy for you both.
When and where is the wedding to be?
Here, as soon as possible.
A whirlwind romance. Splendid!
I can easily postpone my sailing for a week.
This poor child has no mother, so I shall take responsibility for all the arrangements.
Trousseau, reception and everything, and I'll give the bride away.
But our luggage. Go down and tell the porter to take everything out of the car.
Just a minute.
We're most grateful, Mrs. Van Hopper, but I think we'd both prefer to have it all as quiet as possible.
And I couldn't possibly allow you to change your sailing plans. - Oh, but...
No, no, no.
Dear, I'll go down and see that your luggage is brought back.
Thank you, Maxim.
So this is what's been happening during my illness.
Tennis lessons, my foot.
I suppose I've to hand it to you for a fast worker.
How did you manage it? Still waters certainly run deep.
Tell me, have you been doing anything you shouldn't?
I don't know what you mean.
Well, never mind. I always did say that Englishmen have strange tastes.
You certainly have your work cut out as mistress of Manderley.
To be perfectly frank with you, my dear, I can't see you doing it.
You haven't the experience, you haven't the faintest idea what it means to be a great lady.
Of course you know why he's marrying you, don't you?
You haven't flattered yourself that he's in love with you?
Fact is, that empty house got on his nerves to such an extent, he nearly went off his head.
He just couldn't go on living alone.
You'd better leave, Mrs. Van Hopper.
You'll miss your train.
Mrs. De Winter.
Goodbye, my dear, and good luck!
What is he saying?
He says I've forgotten the proof that we're married.
Good heavens.
Somebody else had the same idea.
Isn't she sweet?
Yes.
You'd have liked a bridal veil, wouldn't you?
Or at least...
Oh, Maxim, how lovely.
How perfectly lovely.
Perfectly lovely.
Welcome home, Mr. De Winter.
Thank you, Smith.
Cold, darling?
Yes, just a little bit.
There's no need to be frightened, you know.
Just be yourself, and they'll all adore you.
You don't have to worry about the house at all.
Mrs. Danvers is the housekeeper.
Hello. It's starting to rain.
We'd better hurry up.
Here. Have this. Put it over your head.
Thank you.
That's it. That's Manderley.
Here we are. Frith, everybody well?
Yes, thank you, sir.
Glad to see you home, sir.
This is Mrs. De Winter, Frith.
How do you do?
I didn't expect the whole staff to be in attendance.
Mrs. Danvers' orders, sir.
It won't take long.
This is Mrs. Danvers.
How do you do?
I have everything in readiness for you.
That's very good of you. I...
I didn't expect anything.
I think we'd like some tea, Frith.
Ready in the library, sir.
Come along, darling.
Oh, Maxim, come in.
Good evening, Mrs. Danvers.
Good evening, madam.
I hope Alice was satisfactory, madam.
Oh, yes, thank you, perfectly.
She's the parlor maid.
She'll have to look after you until your own maid arrives.
Oh, but I haven't a maid. I'm sure Alice will do very nicely.
I'm afraid that would not do for very long, madam.
It's usual for ladies in your position to have a personal maid.
I hope you approve the new decoration of these rooms, madam?
Oh, I didn't know it had been changed.
I hope you haven't been to too much trouble.
I only followed out Mr. De Winter's instructions.
Well, what did it look like before?
It had an old paper and different hangings.
It was never used much except for occasional visitors. Oh.
Then it wasn't Mr. De Winter's room originally?
No, madam.
He's never used the east wing before.
Of course, there's no view of the sea from here.
The only good view of the sea is from the west wing.
The room's very charming, and I'm sure I'll be comfortable.
If there's anything you want done, madam, you have only to tell me.
I suppose you've been at Manderley for many years, longer than anyone else.
Not so long as Frith.
He was here when the old gentleman was living, when Mr. De Winter was a boy.
Oh, I see. And you didn't come till after that?
I came here when the first Mrs. De Winter was a bride.
Mrs. Danvers, I do hope we'll be friends.
You must be patient with me.
This sort of life is new to me and I do want to make a success of it, and make Mr. De Winter happy, so I know I can leave all the household arrangements to you.
Very well.
I hope I shall do everything to your satisfaction, madam.
I've managed the house since Mrs. De Winter's death and Mr. De Winter has never complained.
I think I'll go downstairs now.
That room in the west wing I was telling you about is there, through that door.
It's not used now.
It's the most beautiful room in the house, the only one that looks down across the lawns to the sea.
It was Mrs. De Winter's room.
Good morning.
Good morning.
You're Mrs. De Winter, aren't you?
Yes.
My name's Crawley.
I manage the estate for Maxim.
Awfully glad to meet you.
A fearful lot of stuff piled up while Maxim was away.
Yes, I'm sure there must have been.
I do wish I could help with some of it.
No, no! Frank never allows anybody to help him.
He's like an old mother hen with his bills and rents and taxes.
Come on, Frank, we must go over these estimates.
I'll get my papers.
You'll find quantities of breakfast over there.
But you must eat it all, or Cook will be mortally offended.
I'll do my best, Maxim.
I have to go over the place with Frank, just to make sure that he hasn't lost any of it.
You'll be all right, won't you?
Getting acquainted with your new home?
Have a look at The Times. There's a thrilling article on what's the matter with English cricket.
Oh, yes...
My sister, Beatrice, and her husband, Giles Lacy, have invited themselves over for lunch.
Today?
Yes.
I suppose the old girl can't wait to look you over.
You'll find her very direct.
If she doesn't like you, she'll probably tell you so to your face.
Don't worry, darling, I'll be back in time to protect you from her.
Goodbye, darling.
Goodbye, Maxim.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Good morning, madam.
Good morning, Frith.
Isn't there anything I could get for you, madam?
No, thank you, Frith. I'm really not very hungry.
Thank you.
The paper, madam.
Oh, yes. Thank you, Frith.
I slipped.
Thank you, Frith.
It's big, isn't it?
Yes, madam, Manderley is a big place.
This was the banquet hall in the old days.
It's still used on great occasions, such as a big dinner or a ball.
And the public is admitted here, you know, once a week.
That's nice.
I beg pardon, madam.
I'm afraid the fire is not usually lit in the library until the afternoon.
But you'll find one in the morning room.
Of course, if you wish this fire lit now, madam...
No, Frith, I wouldn't dream of it.
Mrs. De Winter...
I mean, the late Mrs. De Winter always did her correspondence and telephoning in the morning room, after breakfast.
Thank you, Frith.
Is anything wrong, madam?
Oh, no. Which way is the morning room?
Oh, it's that door there, on the left.
Oh, yes, thank you.
Mrs. De Winter?
Oh, I'm afraid you've made a mistake.
Mrs. De Winter's been dead for over a year.
Oh, I mean...
That was the house telephone, madam.
Probably the head gardener wishing instructions.
Did you want to see me, Mrs. Danvers?
Mr. De Winter informed me that his sister, Mrs. Lacy, and Major Lacy are expected for luncheon.
I'd like to know if you approve of the menu.
Oh, well, I'm sure it's very suitable, very nice indeed.
You will notice, madam, that I've left a blank space for the sauce.
Mrs. De Winter was most particular about sauces.
Let's have whatever you think that Mrs. De Winter would have ordered.
Thank you, madam.
When you've finished your letters, Robert will take them to the post.
My... My letters?
Oh, yes, of course. Thank you, Mrs. Danvers.
How are you, Frith?
Good morning, Mrs. Lacy.
Where's Mr. De Winter?
I believe he went down to the farm with Mr. Crawley.
How tiresome of him not to be here when we arrive, and how typical.
I must say old Danvers keeps the house looking lovely.
She's certainly learned that trick of arranging flowers from Rebecca.
I wonder how she likes it now, being ordered about by an ex-chorus girl.
Now, where on Earth did you get the idea she's an ex-chorus girl?
He picked her up in the South of France, didn't he?
What if he did?
Well, I mean to say, there you are.
How do you do?
I'm Maxim's wife.
How do you do?
Well, I must say you're quite different from what I expected.
Don't be so silly.
She's exactly what I told you she'd be.
Well, how do you like Manderley?
It's very beautiful, isn't it?
And how do you get along with Mrs. Danvers?
I've never met anyone quite like her before.
You mean, she scares you.
She's not exactly an oil painting, is she?
Giles, you're very much in the way here. Go somewhere else.
Well, I'll try and find Maxim, shall I?
Giles.
I didn't mean to say anything against Mrs. Danvers.
Oh, there's no need for you to be frightened of her, but I shouldn't have any more to do with her than you can help.
Shall we sit down?
Yes. Yes, please.
You see, she's bound to be insanely jealous at first and she must resent you bitterly.
But why should she?
Don't you know?
I should have thought Maxim would have told you.
She simply adored Rebecca.
How are you, Robert?
Quite well, thank you, madam.
Still having trouble with your teeth?
Unfortunately, yes, madam.
You must have them out, all of them.
Wretched nuisances, teeth.
Thank you, madam.
What a plateful.
Do you hunt?
No, I don't. I'm afraid I don't even ride.
You have to ride down here, we all do.
Which do you ride, sidesaddle or astride?
Well, of course, I forgot. You don't, do you?
You must. Nothing else to do around here.
Maxim, when are you going to have parties here again, like the old days?
I haven't thought about it.
But everyone's dying to see you and...
Yes, I bet they are.
Why don't you have the masquerade ball again this summer?
My dear, are you fond of dancing?
I love it, but I'm not very good at it.
Do you rumba?
Never tried.
You must teach me. Actually, I'm trying to find out exactly what your wife does do.
She sketches a little.
Sketches.
Not this modern stuff, I hope, you know, portrait of a lampshade upside down to represent a soul in torment.
Don't sail, do you?
No, I don't.
Thank goodness for that.
You're very much in love with Maxim, aren't you?
Yes, I can see you are.
Don't mind my saying so, but why don't you do something about your hair?
Why don't you have it cut or sweep it back behind your ears?
Oh, no, that's worse.
What does Maxim say about it?
Does he like it like that?
Well, he never mentions it.
Oh, well, don't go by me.
I can see by the way you dress you don't care a hoot how you look.
But I wonder Maxim hasn't been at you.
He's so particular about clothes.
I don't think he ever notices what I wear.
He must have changed a lot, then.
You mustn't worry about old Maxim and his moods.
One never knows what goes on in that quiet mind of his.
Often, he gets into a terrible rage, and when he does...
I don't suppose he'll lose his temper with you.
You seem such a placid little thing.
Come on, old girl. We've got to go on the first tee at 3:00.
All right, I'm coming.
Well, goodbye, Maxim, old boy.
Goodbye, Giles. Thanks for coming, old boy.
Goodbye, my dear.
Forgive me for asking you so many rude questions.
We both really hope you'll be very happy.
Thank you, Beatrice, thank you very much.
And I must congratulate you upon the way Maxim looks.
We were very worried about him this time last year.
But then, of course, you know the whole story.
Goodbye, Beatrice.
Goodbye, old boy.
Goodbye. - Goodbye.
Well, thank heavens they've gone.
Now we can have a walk about the place.
Looks as though we might have a shower. But you won't mind that, will you? No, but wait a minute.
I'll go upstairs and get a coat.
There's a heap of mackintoshes in the flower room.
Run and get a coat from the flower room for Mrs. De Winter, will you?
What do you think of Beatrice?
Oh, I liked her very much, but she kept saying that I was quite different from what she expected.
What the devil did she expect?
Oh, someone smarter and more sophisticated, I'm afraid.
Do you like my hair?
Your hair? Yes, of course I do.
What's the matter with it?
Oh, I don't know. I just wondered.
How funny you are.
Thank you.
Do I have to put it on?
Yes, certainly, certainly, certainly. You can't be too careful with children.
Come on, Jasper. Come and take some of that fat off.
Jasper! Here.
Not that way!
Come here!
Where does that lead to?
Oh, it leads to a little cove where we used to keep a boat.
Oh, let's go down there.
Well, no. It's a perfectly dull, uninteresting stretch of sand,
just like any other.
Oh, please.
We'll walk down and take a look if you really want to.
That's Jasper. There must be something wrong. - Perhaps he's hurt himself.
No, he's all right, leave him alone.
Don't you think I'd better go and see?
Don't bother about him, I tell you, he can't come to any harm.
He'll find his own way back!
Jasper!
Oh, there you are.
What do you want in there, Jasper?
Come on. Come on home.
Let's go home.
Jasper...
I didn't know that there was anybody...
I know that dog.
He comes from the house.
He ain't yours.
No. He's Mr. De Winter's dog.
Have you anything I could tie him with?
Come on, Jasper.
You won't tell anyone you saw me in there, will you?
Don't you belong on the estate?
I weren't doing nothing.
I was just putting me shells away.
She's gone in the sea, ain't she?
She'll never come back no more.
No. She'll never come back.
Come on, Jasper.
Maxim!
What's the matter?
Maxim!
I'm sorry I was such a time, but I had to find a rope for Jasper.
Hurry up, Jasper, for heaven's sake.
Please wait for me.
Maxim, what is it? You look so angry.
You knew I didn't want you to go there, but you deliberately went.
Why not? There was only a cottage down there and a strange man who...
You didn't go in the cottage, did you?
Yes, the door was...
Don't go there again, do you hear?
Well, why not?
Because I hate the place. And if you had my memories, you wouldn't go there or talk about it or even think about it.
What's the matter? Oh, I'm sorry, please.
We should have stayed away.
We should never have come back to Manderley.
Oh, what a fool I was.
I've made you unhappy.
Somehow, I've hurt you.
Oh, I can't bear to see you like this because I love you so much.
Do you?
I've made you cry.
Forgive me.
I sometimes seem to fly off the handle for no reason at all.
Don't I?
Come, we'll go home and have some tea and forget all about it.
Yes, let's forget all about it.
Here, let me have Jasper.
Hello. Come in.
Oh, please don't get up, Mr. Crawley.
I was just wondering if you meant what you said the other day
about showing me the run of things.
Of course I did.
What are you doing now?
Notifying all the tenants that in celebration of Maxim's return with his bride, this week's rent will be free.
Oh, is that Maxim's idea?
Oh, yes, all the servants get an extra week's wages, too.
Oh, he didn't tell me.
Can't I help you?
I could at least lick the stamps.
Well, that's terribly nice of you. Won't you sit down?
Yes, thank you.
I was down at the cottage on the beach the other day.
There was a man there, a queer sort of person.
Jasper kept barking at him.
Oh, yes, it must have been Ben.
Excuse me.
He's quite harmless.
We give him odd jobs now and then.
That cottage bay seemed to be going to rack and ruin.
Why isn't something done about it?
I think if Maxim wanted anything done about it, he'd tell me.
Are those all Rebecca's things down there?
Yes. Yes, they are.
What did she use the cottage for?
The boat used to be moored near there.
What boat?
What happened to it?
Was that the boat she was sailing in when she was drowned?
Yes.
It capsized and sank. She was washed overboard.
Wasn't she afraid to go out like that alone?
She wasn't afraid of anything.
Where did they find her?
Near Edgecombe, about 40 miles up channel about two months afterwards.
Maxim went up to identify her.
It was horrible for him.
Yes, it must have been.
Mr. Crawley, please don't think me morbidly curious. It isn't that. It's...
It's just that I feel at such a disadvantage.
All the time, whenever I meet anyone, Maxim's sister or even the servants,
I know they're all thinking the same thing, that they're all comparing me with her, with Rebecca.
You mustn't think that.
I can't tell you how glad I am that you married Maxim.
It's going to make all the difference to his life.
From my point of view, it's very refreshing to find someone like yourself, who's not entirely in tune, shall we say, with Manderley.
That's very sweet of you.
I daresay I've been stupid, but every day I realize the things she had that I lack.
Beauty and wit and intelligence, and all the things that are so important in a woman.
You have qualities that are just as important, more important, if I may say so.
Kindliness and sincerity, and if you'll forgive me, modesty, mean more to a husband than all the wit and beauty in the world.
We, none of us want to live in the past,
Maxim least of all.
It's up to you, you know, to lead us away from it.
I promise you I won't bring this up again, but before we end this conversation, would you answer just one more question?
If it's something I'm able to answer, I'll do my best.
Tell me, what was Rebecca really like?
I suppose...
I suppose she was the most beautiful creature I ever saw.
Good evening, Maxim.
Hello.
The films of the honeymoon have arrived at last.
Do we have time, do you think, before dinner?
What on Earth have you done to yourself?
Oh, nothing. I just ordered a new dress from London. I hope you don't mind.
Oh, no, no. Only, do you think that sort of thing's right for you?
It doesn't seem your type at all.
I thought you'd like it.
And what have you done to your hair?
Oh, I see.
Dear, oh, dear. I'm sorry.
You look lovely, lovely.
It's very nice, for a change.
Shall we see these pictures?
Yes. I'd love to see them.
Look now, look at that.
Wasn't it wonderful, darling? Can't we go back there someday?
Yes, of course. Of course. Look at you.
Won't our grandchildren be delighted when they see how lovely you were?
Oh, look at you.
Oh, I like that.
Look at that.
Yes, very nice.
Remember that?
Yes.
I wish our honeymoon could have lasted forever, Maxim.
Dash it, look.
I've threaded it up wrong as usual or something.
Yes, Frith. What is it?
Excuse me, sir. May I have a word with you?
Yes.
Come in.
It's about Robert, sir.
There's been a slight unpleasantness between him and Mrs. Danvers.
Oh, dear.
Robert is very upset.
This is trouble.
What is it?
It appears that Mrs. Danvers has accused Robert of stealing a valuable ornament from the morning room.
Robert denies the accusation most emphatically, sir.
What was the thing, anyway?
China cupid, sir. Oh, dear.
That's one of our treasures, isn't it?
Well, tell Mrs. Danvers to get to the bottom of it somehow. - Tell her I'm sure it wasn't Robert.
Very good, sir.
Why do they come to me with these things?
That's your job, sweetheart.
Maxim, I wanted to tell you, but I forgot.
The fact is, I broke the china cupid.
You broke it?
Now, why on Earth didn't you say something about it when Frith was here?
I don't know. I didn't like to.
I was afraid he'd think me a fool.
He'll think you much more of a fool now.
You'll have to explain to him and Mrs. Danvers.
Oh, no, Maxim. You do it. I'll go upstairs.
Don't be such a little idiot, darling.
Anybody would think you were afraid of them.
It's all a mistake, Mrs. Danvers.
Apparently, Mrs. De Winter broke the cupid herself and forgot to say anything about it.
I'm so sorry.
I never thought that I'd get Robert into trouble.
Is it possible to repair the ornament, madam?
No, I'm afraid it isn't.
It smashed into pieces.
What did you do with the pieces?
Well, I put them at the back of one of the drawers in the writing desk.
Well, it looks as though Mrs. De Winter was afraid you were going to put her in prison, doesn't it, Mrs. Danvers?
Well, never mind.
Do what you can to find the pieces. See if they can be mended, and above all, tell Robert to dry his tears.
I shall apologize to Robert, of course.
Perhaps if such a thing happens again, Mrs. De Winter will tell me personally.
Yes, yes, all right. Thank you, Mrs. Danvers.
Well, I suppose that clip will hold all right. I don't know.
I'm awfully sorry, darling.
It was very careless of me.
Mrs. Danvers must be furious with me.
Hang Mrs. Danvers. Why on Earth should you be frightened of her?
You behave more like an upstairs maid or something, - not the mistress of the house at all.
Yes, I know I do.
But I feel so uncomfortable.
I try my best every day, but it's very difficult with people looking me up and down as if I were a prize cow.
What does it matter if they do?
You must remember that life at Manderley is the only thing that interests anybody down here.
What a slap in the eye I must have been to them, then.
I suppose that's why you married me, because you knew I was dull and gauche and inexperienced, and there'd never be any gossip about me.
Gossip?
What do you mean?
I don't know.
I just said it for something to say.
Don't look at me like that.
What's the matter?
What have I said?
Wasn't a very attractive thing to say, was it?
It was rude, hateful.
I wonder if I did a very selfish thing in marrying you.
How do you mean?
I'm not much of a companion to you, am I?
You don't get much fun, do you?
You ought to have married a boy, someone of your own age.
Maxim, why do you say this?
Of course we're companions.
Are we?
I don't know.
I'm very difficult to live with.
No, you're not difficult. You're easy, very easy.
Our marriage is a success, isn't it, a great success?
We're happy, aren't we? Terribly happy?
If you don't think we are happy, it would be much better if you didn't pretend.
I'll go away.
Why don't you answer me?
How can I answer you when I don't know the answer myself?
If you say we're happy, let's leave it at that.
Happiness is something I know nothing about.
Oh, look.
There's the one when I left the camera running on the tripod, remember?
Pardon me, madam. Is there anything I can do for you?
I'm all right, Hilda. Thank you very much.
I'll bring the sandwiches immediately, madam.
Hilda.
Yes, madam?
The west wing.
Nobody ever uses it anymore, do they?
No, madam.
Not since the death of Mrs. De Winter.
Come along, Mr. Jack, or someone may see you.
Well, Danny, old harpy, it's been good to see you again.
I've been simply breathless to pick up all the news.
I really don't think it's wise for you to come here, Mr. Jack.
Jasper, come here.
Oh, nonsense, nonsense. It's just like coming back home.
Quiet, Mr. Jack.
Yes. We must be careful not to shock Cinderella, mustn't we?
She's in the morning room.
If you leave through the garden door, she won't see you.
I must say, I feel a little like the poor relation, sneaking around through back doors.
Well, toodle-oo, Danny.
Goodbye, Mr. Jack, and please be careful.
Jasper, be quiet.
Looking for me?
I didn't make you jump, did I?
No. Of course not. I didn't quite know who it was.
You're pleased to see me, aren't you, old boy?
I'm glad there's someone in the family to welcome me back to Manderley.
And how is dear old Max?
Very well, thank you.
I hear he went up to London, left his little bride all alone.
It's too bad.
Isn't he rather afraid that somebody might come down and carry you off?
Danny, all your precautions were in vain.
The mistress of the house was hiding behind the door.
Oh. What about presenting me to the bride?
This is Mr. Favell, madam.
How do you do?
Won't you have some tea or something?
Now, isn't that a charming invitation?
I've been asked to tea, Danny, and I've a good mind to accept.
Oh, well, perhaps you're right. Pity, just when we were getting on so nicely.
We mustn't lead the young bride astray, must we, Jasper?
Goodbye. It's been fun meeting you.
Oh, and by the way, it would be very decent of you if you didn't mention this little visit to your revered husband.
He doesn't exactly approve of me.
Very well.
That's very sporting of you.
I wish I had a young bride of three months waiting for me at home.
I'm just a lonely old bachelor.
Fare thee well.
Oh, and I know what was wrong with that introduction.
Danny didn't tell you, did she?
I am Rebecca's favorite cousin.
Toodle-oo!
Do you wish anything, madam?
I didn't expect to see you, Mrs. Danvers.
I noticed that a window wasn't closed and I came up to see - if I could fasten it.
Why did you say that?
I closed it before I left the room.
You opened it yourself, didn't you?
You've always wanted to see this room, haven't you, madam?
Why did you never ask me to show it to you?
I was ready to show it to you every day.
It's a lovely room, isn't it?
Loveliest room you've ever seen.
Everything is kept just as Mrs. De Winter liked it.
Nothing has been altered since that last night.
I'll show you her dressing room.
This is where I keep all her clothes.
You would like to see them, wouldn't you?
Feel this.
It was a Christmas present from Mr. De Winter.
He was always giving her expensive gifts, the whole year round.
I keep her underwear on this side.
They were made specially for her by the nuns in the Convent of St. Claire.
I always used to wait up for her, no matter how late.
Sometimes she and Mr. De Winter didn't come home until dawn.
While she was undressing, she'd tell me about the party she'd been to.
She knew everyone that mattered.
Everyone loved her.
When she finished her bath, she'd go into the bedroom and go over to the dressing table.
Oh, you've moved her brush, haven't you?
There. That's better.
Just as she always laid it down.
Come on, Danny.
Hair drill, " she would say.
And I'd stand behind her like this and brush away for 20 minutes at a time.
And then she would say, "Good night, Danny, "
and step into her bed.
I embroidered this case for her myself, and I keep it here always.
Did you ever see anything so delicate?
Look.
You can see my hand through it.
You wouldn't think she'd been gone so long, would you?
Sometimes when I walk along the corridor,
I fancy I hear her just behind me.
That quick light step.
I couldn't mistake it anywhere.
Not only in this room, it's in all the rooms in the house.
I can almost hear it now.
Do you think the dead come back and watch the living?
No, I don't believe it.
Sometimes I wonder if she doesn't come back here to Manderley, and watch you and Mr. De Winter together.
You look tired.
Why don't you stay here a while and rest?
And listen to the sea.
So soothing.
Listen to it.
Listen.
Listen to the sea.
Tell Mrs. Danvers I wish to see her immediately.
You sent for me, madam?
Yes, Mrs. Danvers.
I want you to get rid of all these things.
These are Mrs. De Winter's things.
I am Mrs. De Winter now.
Very well. I'll give the instructions.
Just a moment, please.
Mrs. Danvers, I intend to say nothing to Mr. De Winter about Mr. Favell's visit.
In fact, I prefer to forget everything that happened this afternoon.
Maxim, Maxim, you've been gone all day.
You're choking me.
Well, well, well, what have you been doing with yourself?
I've been thinking.
What did you want to do that for?
Come in here and I'll tell you.
Darling, could we have a costume ball just as you used to?
Now what put that into your mind?
Has Beatrice been at you?
No, no, but I feel that we ought to do something to make people feel that Manderley is just the same as it always was.
Oh, please, darling, could we?
You don't know what it would mean, you know.
You'd have to be hostess to hundreds of people, all the county.
And a lot of young people would come up from London, - and turn the house into a nightclub.
Oh, yes. But I want to. Please.
I've never been to a large party, but I could learn what to do.
And I promise you, you wouldn't be ashamed of me.
All right, if you think you'd enjoy it.
You'd better get Mrs. Danvers to help you out, won't you?
No, no. I don't need Mrs. Danvers to help me.
I can do it myself.
All right, my sweet.
Thank you, darling. Thank you.
What'll you go as? - I never dress up.
That's the one privilege I claim as the host.
What will you be?
Alice in Wonderland, with that ribbon around your hair?
No, I won't tell you.
I'll design a costume all by myself and give you the surprise of your life.
Come in.
Robert found these sketches in the library, madam.
Did you intend throwing them away?
Yes, Mrs. Danvers, I did.
They were just some ideas I was sketching for my costume for the ball.
Hasn't Mr. De Winter suggested anything?
No, I want to surprise him. I don't want him to know anything about it.
I merely thought that you might find a costume among the family portraits that would suit you.
Oh, you mean those at the top of the stairs?
I'll go and look at them.
This one, for instance.
Might have been designed for you.
I'm sure you could have it copied.
I've heard Mr. De Winter say that this is his favorite of all the paintings.
It's Lady Caroline de Winter, one of his ancestors.
Oh, well, that's a splendid idea, Mrs. Danvers. I'm very grateful.
Everything under control, Frith?
Yes, sir, thank you.
Excuse me, sir, are you supposed to be a schoolmaster? Oh, no.
This is just my old cap and gown.
It certainly makes a very nice costume, sir.
And economical, too.
Yes. That was the idea.
Good evening, Robert. Not very good weather for the ball.
Very misty on the way and very chilly.
Oh, this wig's so tight they ought to send an aspirin with it.
What's the idea? Adam and Eve?
Oh, Maxim, don't be disgusting.
Strongman.
Where's my weight thing? - What thing?
You haven't left it in the car, have you?
There it is.
You were the first one down? - Yes.
Where's the child?
Well, she's keeping her costume a terrific secret. Wouldn't even let me into her room.
Oh, lovely.
I'll go up and give her a hand.
I could do with a drink.
Won't you catch a cold in that thing?
Don't be silly. Pure wool, old boy.
Pardon me, sir. You forgot this.
Thank you.
Here I am, dear, it's Bea.
I've come to give you a hand.
Oh, please don't come in, Beatrice. I don't want anyone to see my costume. Oh.
Oh, you won't be long, will you?
Because the first people will be arriving any moment.
Now, you're sure that's where that should be?
Yes, madam, it's just right.
Isn't it exciting?
Indeed it is, madam.
I've always heard of the Manderley ball, and now I'm really going to see one.
I'm sure there will be no one there to touch you, madam.
Do you really think so?
Now, where's my fan?
You're sure I look all right?
You look ever so beautiful.
Well, here goes.
Good evening, Mr. De Winter.
What the devil do you think you're doing?
Rebecca.
But it's the picture. The one in the gallery.
What is it?
What have I done?
Go and take it off.
It doesn't matter what you put on.
What are you standing there for?
Didn't you hear what I said?
Sir George and Lady Moore.
Dudley Tennant. Admiral and Lady Burbank.
I watched you go down, just as I watched her a year ago.
Even in the same dress, you couldn't compare.
You knew it.
You knew that she wore it, and yet you deliberately suggested I wear it.
Why do you hate me?
What have I done to you that you should ever hate me so?
You tried to take her place, you let him marry you.
I've seen his face, his eyes.
They're the same as those first weeks after she died.
I used to listen to him walking up and down, up and down, all night long, night after night, thinking of her, suffering torture because he'd lost her.
I don't want to know. I don't want to know!
You thought you could be Mrs. De Winter, live in her house, walk in her steps, take the things that were hers.
But she's too strong for you. You can't fight her.
No one ever got the better of her. Never. Never.
She was beaten in the end, but it wasn't a man, it wasn't a woman.
It was the sea.
Oh, stop it. Stop it.
Oh, stop it.
You're overwrought, madam.
I've opened a window for you.
A little air will do you good.
Why don't you go?
Why don't you leave Manderley?
He doesn't need you.
He's got his memories.
He doesn't love you.
He wants to be alone again with her.
You've nothing to stay for.
You've nothing to live for, really, have you?
Look down there.
It's easy, isn't it?
Why don't you?
Why don't you?
Go on.
Don't be afraid.
Ship on the rocks!
A ship aground, sending up rockets!
Come on, everybody, down to the bay. Notify the coast guard.
Maxim! Maxim!
Ship ashore. Come on!
Come on, everybody. Come on! Come on!
Maxim! Maxim!
Oh!
Ben, have you seen Mr. De Winter anywhere?
She won't come back, will she?
You said so.
Who, Ben?
What do you mean?
The other one.
Frank, have you seen Maxim anywhere?
Not since about half an hour ago.
I thought he'd gone up to the house.
No, he hasn't been in the house at all, and I'm afraid something might have happened to him.
Frank, what's the matter?
Is anything wrong?
There is something wrong.
The diver who went down to inspect the bottom of the ship came across the hull of another boat.
A little sailboat.
Frank, is it...
Yes.
It's Rebecca's.
How did they recognize it?
He's a local man. Knew it instantly.
It'll be so hard on poor Maxim.
It's going to bring it all back again, and worse than before.
Why did they have to find it?
Why couldn't they have left it there in peace at the bottom of the sea?
Well, I'd better get along and arrange some breakfast for the men.
All right, Frank. I'll go and look for Maxim.
Hello.
Maxim.
You haven't had any sleep.
Have you forgiven me?
Forgiven you?
What have I got to forgive you for?
For last night.
My stupidity about the costume.
Oh, that.
I'd forgotten.
I was angry with you, wasn't I?
Maxim, can't we start all over again?
I don't ask that you should love me.
I won't ask impossible things.
I'll be your friend, your companion.
I'll be happy with that.
You love me very much, don't you?
But it's too late, my darling.
We've lost our little chance of happiness.
No, Maxim, no.
Yes.
It's all over now.
The thing's happened.
The thing I have dreaded day after day.
Night after night.
Maxim, what are you trying to tell me?
Rebecca has won.
Her shadow has been between us all the time, keeping us from one another.
She knew that this would happen.
What are you saying?
They sent a diver down.
He found another boat.
Yes, I know. Frank told me.
Rebecca's boat.
Oh, it's terrible for you. I'm so sorry.
The diver made another discovery.
Broke one of the ports and looked into the cabin.
There was a body in there.
She wasn't alone.
There was someone sailing with her, and you have to find out who it was, that's it, isn't it, Maxim?
You don't understand.
There was no one with her.
It's Rebecca's body lying there on the cabin floor.
Oh, no.
The woman that was washed up at Edgecombe, the woman that is now buried in the family crypt,
that was not Rebecca.
That was the body of some unknown woman, unclaimed, belonging nowhere.
I identified it. But I knew it wasn't Rebecca.
It was all a lie.
I knew where Rebecca's body was, lying on that cabin floor on the bottom of the sea.
How did you know, Maxim?
Because I put it there.
Will you look into my eyes and tell me that you love me now?
You see?
I was right.
It's too late.
No, it's not too late.
You're not to say that.
I love you more than anything in the world.
Oh, please, Maxim, kiss me, please.
No.
It's no use.
It's too late.
Oh, we can't lose each other now.
We must be together always.
No secrets, no shadows.
We may only have a few days, a few hours.
Maxim, why didn't you tell me before?
I nearly did sometimes, but you never seemed close enough.
How could we be close when I knew you were always thinking of Rebecca?
How could I even ask you to love me, when I knew you loved Rebecca still?
What are you talking about?
What do you mean?
Whenever you touched me, I knew you were comparing me with Rebecca.
Whenever you looked at me or spoke to me or walked with me in the garden,
I knew you were thinking, "This I did with Rebecca, and this, and this. "
Oh, it's true, isn't it?
You thought I loved Rebecca?
You thought that?
I hated her.
Oh, I was carried away by her, enchanted by her as everyone was.
And when I was married, I was told I was the luckiest man in the world.
She was so lovely, so accomplished, so amusing.
She's got the three things that really matter in a wife, " everyone said.
Breeding, brains and beauty. "
And I believed them.
Completely.
But I never had a moment's happiness with her.
She was incapable of love or tenderness or decency.
You didn't love her. You didn't love her.
Do you remember that cliff where you first saw me in Monte Carlo?
Well, I went there with Rebecca on our honeymoon.
That's where I found out about her, four days after we were married.
She stood there laughing, her black hair blowing in the wind and told me all about herself.
Everything.
Things I'll never tell a living soul.
I wanted to kill her.
It would have been so easy.
You remember the precipice?
I frightened you, didn't I?
You thought I was mad.
Perhaps I was.
Perhaps I am mad.
It wouldn't make for sanity, would it? Living with the devil?
I'll make a bargain with you, " she said.
You'd look rather foolish trying to divorce me now after four days of marriage, so I'll play the part of a devoted wife, mistress of your precious Manderley.
I'll make it the most famous showplace in England, if you like, and people will visit us and envy us, and say we're the luckiest, happiest couple in the country.
What a grand joke it'll be.
What a triumph. "
I should never have accepted her dirty bargain, but I did.
I was younger then, and tremendously conscious of the family honor.
Family honor.
She knew that I'd sacrifice everything rather than stand up in a divorce court and give her away, admit that our marriage was a rotten fraud.
You despise me, don't you?
As I despise myself.
You can't understand what my feelings were, can you?
Of course I can, darling.
Of course I can.
Well, I kept the bargain and so did she, apparently.
Oh, she played the game brilliantly, but after a while, she began to grow careless.
She took a flat in London, and she'd stay away for days at a time.
Then she started to bring her friends down here.
I warned her, but she shrugged her shoulders.
What's it got to do with you?" She said.
She even started on Frank.
Poor, faithful Frank.
Then there was a cousin of hers, a man named Favell.
Yes. I know him.
He came the day you went to London.
Why didn't you tell me?
I didn't like to. I thought it would remind you of Rebecca.
Remind me?
As if I needed reminding.
Favell used to visit her here in this cottage.
I found out about it, and I warned her that if he came here again, I'd shoot them both.
One night, when I found she had come back quietly from London,
I thought that Favell was with her, and I knew then that I couldn't stand this life of filth and deceit any longer.
I decided to come down here and have it out with both of them.
But she was alone.
She was expecting Favell, but he hadn't come.
She was lying on the divan, a large tray of cigarette stubs beside her.
She looked ill, queer.
Suddenly, she got up, started to walk toward me.
When I have a child, " she said, "neither you nor anyone else could ever prove it wasn't yours.
You would like to have an heir, wouldn't you, Max, for your precious Manderley?"
Then she started to laugh.
How funny.
How supremely, wonderfully funny.
I'll be the perfect mother, just as I've been the perfect wife.
No one will ever know.
It ought to give you the thrill of your life, Max, to watch my son grow bigger day by day and to know that when you die, Manderley will be his. "
She was face to face with me.
One hand in her pocket, the other holding a cigarette.
She was smiling.
Well, Max?
What are you going to do about it?
Aren't you going to kill me?"
I suppose I went mad for a moment.
I must have struck her.
She stood staring at me.
She looked almost triumphant.
Then she started toward me again. Smiling.
Suddenly, she stumbled and fell.
When I looked down, ages afterwards, it seemed, she was lying on the floor.
She had struck her head on a heavy piece of ship's tackle.
I remember wondering why she was still smiling.
Then I realized she was dead.
But you didn't kill her.
It was an accident.
Who would believe me?
I lost my head.
I just knew I had to do something. Anything.
I carried her out to the boat.
It was very dark. There was no moon.
I put her in the cabin.
When the boat seemed a safe distance from the shore, I took a spike, and drove it again and again through the planking of the hull.
I had opened up the seacocks and the water began to come in fast.
I climbed over into the dinghy and pulled away.
I saw the boat heel over and sink.
I pulled back into the cove.
It started raining.
Maxim, does anyone else know of this?
No. No one except you and me.
We must explain it.
It's got to be the body of someone you've never seen before.
No, they're bound to know her.
Her rings, bracelets she always wore.
They'll identify her body, then they'll remember the other woman.
The other woman buried in the crypt.
If they find out it was Rebecca, you must simply say you made a mistake about the other body.
That the day you went to Edgecombe, you were ill, you didn't know what you were doing.
Rebecca's dead. That's what we've got to remember.
Rebecca's dead. She can't speak. She can't bear witness.
She can't harm you anymore.
We're the only two people in the world that know, Maxim, you and I.
I'd told you once that I'd done a selfish thing in marrying you.
You can understand now what I meant.
I've loved you, my darling.
I shall always love you, but I've known all along that Rebecca would win in the end.
No, no.
She hasn't won.
No matter what happens now, she hasn't won.
Hello?
Hello, Frank.
Hello, Frank.
Who?
Colonel Julyan?
Yes. Tell him I'll meet him there as soon as I possibly can.
What?
Say we could talk about that when we're sure about the matter.
What's happened?
Colonel Julyan called.
He's the chief constable of the county.
He's been asked by the police to go to the mortuary.
He wanted to know if I could possibly have made a mistake about that other body.
Well, Colonel Julyan, apparently I did make a mistake about that other body.
The mistake was natural under the circumstances.
Besides, you weren't well at the time.
That's nonsense. I was perfectly well.
Don't let it worry you, Maxim.
Nobody can blame you for making a mistake.
The pity is, you've got to go through the same thing all over again.
What do you mean?
There'll have to be another inquest, of course.
Same formality and red tape.
Wish you could be spared the publicity of it, but I'm afraid that's impossible.
Oh, yes, publicity.
I suppose Mrs. De Winter went below for something and a squall hit the boat with nobody at the helm.
I imagine that's about the solution now, don't you think so, Crawley?
Oh, yes.
Probably the door jammed, and she couldn't get on deck again. Yeah.
Tabb, the boat builder, will undoubtedly come to some such conclusion.
Why, what would he know about it?
Well, he's examining the boat now.
Purely as a matter of routine, you know.
I'll be at the inquest tomorrow, Maxim, quite unofficially, you know.
We must get together for a game of golf when it's all over, eh?
Bye-bye.
I have the evening papers, madam. Would you care to see them?
Oh, no thank you, Frith, and I prefer that Mr. De Winter weren't troubled with them, either.
I understand, madam. Permit me to say that we're all most distressed outside.
Thank you, Frith.
I'm afraid the news has been a great shock to Mrs. Danvers.
Yes, I rather expected it would be.
It seems there's to be a coroner's inquest, madam?
Yes, Frith. It's purely a formality.
Of course, madam. I...
I wanted to say that if any of us might be required to give evidence,
I should be only too pleased to do anything that might help the family.
Oh, thank you, Frith, why, I... I'm sure Mr. De Winter will be very happy to hear it.
But I don't think anything will be necessary.
Maxim.
Hello, darling.
Oh, Maxim, I'm worried about what you'll do at the inquest tomorrow.
What do you mean?
You won't lose your temper, will you?
Promise me that they won't make you angry.
All right, darling.
I promise.
No matter what he asks you, you won't lose your head?
Don't worry, dear.
They can't do anything at once, can they?
No.
Then we've a little time left to be together.
Yes.
I want to go to the inquest with you.
I'd rather you didn't, darling.
But I can't wait here alone.
I promise you, I won't be any trouble to you.
And I must be near you so that no matter what happens, we won't be separated for a moment.
All right, dear.
I don't mind this whole thing except for you.
I can't forget what it's done to you.
I've been thinking of nothing else since it happened.
It's gone forever, that funny, young, lost look I loved.
It won't ever come back.
I killed that when I told you about Rebecca.
It's gone.
In a few hours, you've grown so much older.
Oh, Maxim, Maxim.
Black Jack Brady was his name.
The most important arrest I ever made.
It must have been about two years ago now.
Of course, there was no doubt about it.
He was hung a month after I caught him.
Hello. Wait a minute.
They've got old Balmy Ben up now.
You remember the late Mrs. De Winter, don't you?
She's gone.
Yes, we know that.
She went in the sea. The sea got her. - That's right.
That's right.
Now we want you to tell us whether you were on the shore
that last night she went sailing.
Were you on the shore that last night she went out, when she didn't come back?
I didn't see nothing.
I don't want to go to the asylum.
Them cruel folks there.
Now, nobody's going to send you to the asylum.
All we want you to do is tell us what you saw.
I didn't see nothing.
Come, come.
Did you see Mrs. De Winter get into her boat that last night?
I don't know nothing.
I don't want to go to the asylum.
Very well. You may go.
You may go now.
Mr. Tabb, step forward, please.
The evidence you give will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God?
I do, so help me God.
The late Mrs. De Winter used to send her boat - to your shipyard for reconditioning.
That's right, sir.
Can you remember any occasion when she had any sort of accident with the boat?
No, sir. I often said Mrs. De Winter was a born sailor.
Now, when Mrs. De Winter went below, as is supposed, and a sudden gust of wind came down, that would be enough to capsize the boat, wouldn't it?
Excuse me, sir.
But there's a little more to it than that.
What do you mean, Mr. Tabb?
I mean, sir, the seacocks.
What are the seacocks?
Sea...
The seacocks are the valves to drain out the boat.
They're always kept tight closed when you're afloat.
Yes?
Well, yesterday, when I examined that boat, I found they'd been opened.
What could be the reason for that?
Just this, that's what flooded the boat and sunk her.
Are you implying that boat never capsized at all?
I know it's a terrible thing to say, sir, but in my opinion, she was scuttled.
And there's them holes.
What holes?
In her planking.
What are you talking about?
Of course, that boat's been underwater for over a year, and the tide's been knocking her against the ridge.
But it seemed to me them holes looked as if she'd made them from the inside.
Then you believe she must have done it deliberately.
Couldn't have been no accident, not with her knowledge of boats.
You knew the former Mrs. De Winter very well, I believe?
Oh, yes.
Would you have believed her capable of suicide?
Frankly, I would not.
But you never can tell.
You may stand down, Mr. Tabb.
Mr. De Winter, please.
Sorry to drag you back for further questioning, Mr. De Winter.
But you've heard the statement of Mr. Tabb.
I wonder if you can help us in any way.
I'm afraid not.
Can you think of any reason why there should be holes in the planking of the late Mrs. De Winter's boat?
Well, of course I can't think of any reason.
Has anyone ever discussed these holes with you before?
Well, since the boat has been at the bottom of the ocean, I scarcely think that likely.
Mr. De Winter, I want you to believe we all feel very deeply for you in this matter.
But you must remember that I don't conduct this inquiry for my own amusement.
That's rather obvious, isn't it?
I hope that it is.
Well, since she went sailing alone, are we to believe that she drove those holes herself?
You may believe what you like.
Can you enlighten us as to why Mrs. De Winter should have wanted to end her own life?
I know of no reason whatever.
Mr. De Winter, however painful it may be,
I have to ask you a very personal question.
Were relations between you and the late Mrs. De Winter perfectly happy?
I won't stand this any longer!
We'll adjourn till after lunch.
Mr. De Winter, I presume you'll be available for us then?
I told you, you should have had some breakfast.
You're hungry. That's what's the matter with you.
Mr. Frith thought you might like to have some lunch from the house, and sent me with it.
No, that's fine. Pull around the corner.
Very good, sir.
Awfully foolish of me, fainting like that.
Nonsense.
If you hadn't fainted like that, I'd have really lost my temper.
Darling, please be careful.
Darling, wait here a few moments. I'll see if I can find old Frank.
Of course, darling. Don't worry about me. I'll be all right.
Sure?
Here, try a spot of this.
Do you good.
Thank you.
Are you all right?
Yes, of course.
I won't be long.
Right you are.
Hello.
And how does the bride find herself today?
I say, marriage with Max is not exactly a bed of roses, is it?
I think you'd better go before Maxim gets back.
Oh, jealous, is he?
Well, I can't say I blame him.
But you don't think I'm the big bad wolf, do you?
I'm not, you know. I'm a perfectly ordinary, harmless bloke.
And I think you're behaving splendidly over all this.
Perfectly splendidly.
You know, you've grown up a bit since I last saw you.
It's no wonder...
What do you want, Favell?
Oh, hello, Max.
Things are going pretty well for you, aren't they?
Better than you ever expected.
I was rather worried about you at first. That's why I came down to the inquest.
Well, I'm touched by your solicitude. But if you don't mind, we'd rather like to have our lunch.
Lunch?
I say, what a jolly idea. Rather like a picnic, isn't it?
I'm so sorry.
Do you mind if I put this there?
You know, Max, old boy, I really think I ought to talk things over with you.
Talk what things over?
Well, those holes in the planking, for one thing.
Those holes that were drilled from the inside.
Oh, Mullen?
Yes, sir?
Would you, like a good fellow, have my car filled with petrol?
It's almost empty.
Very good, sir.
And, Mullen, close the door, will you?
Yes, sir.
Does this bother you?
You know, old boy, I have a strong feeling that before the day's out, somebody's going to make use of that rather expressive, though somewhat old-fashioned term, "foul play. "
Am I boring you with all this?
No?
Good. Well, you see, Max, I find myself in a rather awkward position.
You've only got to read this note to understand.
It's from Rebecca.
And, what's more, she had the foresight to put a date on it.
She wrote me the day she died.
Incidentally, I was at a party on that night so I didn't get it until the next day.
And what makes you think that note would interest me?
Oh, I'm not gonna bother you with the contents now.
But I can assure you that it is not the note of a woman who intends to drown herself that same night.
By the way, what do you do with old bones?
Bury them?
However, for the time being...
You know, Max, I'm getting fed up with my job as a motorcar salesman.
I don't know if you've ever experienced the feeling of driving an expensive motorcar which isn't your own?
But it can be very, very exasperating.
You know what I mean. You want to own the car yourself.
I often wonder what it would be like to retire to the country.
Have a nice little place with a few acres of shooting.
I've never figured out what it would cost a year, but I'd like to talk about it with you.
I'd like to have your advice on how to live comfortably without hard work.
Hello, Favell.
You looking for me, Maxim?
Yes.
Mr. Favell and I have a little business transaction on hand.
I think we had better conduct it over at the inn.
They may have a private room there.
Well, see you later.
Find Colonel Julyan. Tell him I want to see him immediately.
Come on, Favell. Let's go.
Have you a private room, please?
Of course, sir.
Hope this will do, Mr. De Winter.
Splendid. Splendid. Exactly like the Ritz.
Any orders, gents? Yes.
You might bring me a large brandy and soda.
How about you, Max?
Have one on me. I feel I can afford to play host.
Thanks. I don't mind if I do.
Make it two, will you, like a good fellow?
Where's Mr. De Winter?
Through the other door, sir.
Colonel Julyan, this is Mr. Favell.
Oh, I know Colonel Julyan. We're old friends, aren't we?
Since you're old friends, I assume you also know he's head of the police here.
He might be interested to hear your proposition.
Tell him all about it.
I don't know what you mean. I merely said I hoped to give up selling cars and retire into the country.
Actually, he offered to withhold a vital piece of evidence from the inquest if I made it worth his while.
I only want to see justice done, Colonel.
Now, that boat builder's evidence suggested certain possible theories concerning Rebecca's death.
One of them, of course, is suicide.
Now I have a little note here which I consider puts that possibility quite out of court.
Read it, Colonel.
Jack, darling,
I've just seen the doctor and I'm going down to Manderley right away.
I shall be at the cottage all this evening and shall leave the door open for you.
I have something terribly important to tell you.
Rebecca. "
Now, does that look like the note of a woman who had made up her mind to kill herself?
And apart from that, do you mean to tell me that if you wanted to commit suicide, you would go to all the trouble of putting out to sea in a boat, and then take a hammer and chisel
and laboriously knock holes through the bottom of it?
Come, Colonel.
As an officer of the law, don't you feel there are some slight grounds for suspicion?
Of murder?
What else?
You've known Max a long time.
So you know he's the old-fashioned type, who'd die to defend his honor, or who'd kill for it.
It's blackmail, pure and simple.
Blackmail is not so pure, nor so simple.
It can bring a lot of trouble to a great many people.
And the blackmailer sometimes finds himself in jail at the end of it.
Oh, I see. You're going to hold de Winter's hand through all this.
Just because he's the big noise around here and he's actually permitted you to dine with him.
Be careful, Favell. You've brought an accusation of murder.
Have you any witnesses?
I do have a witness.
It's that fellow, Ben.
If that stupid coroner hadn't been as much of a snob as you are, he'd have seen that half-wit was hiding something.
And why should Ben do that?
Because we caught him once, Rebecca and I, peering at us through the cottage window.
Rebecca threatened him with the asylum. That's why he was afraid to speak.
But he was always hanging about. He must have seen this whole thing.
It's ridiculous, even listening to all this.
You're like a little trade union, all of you, aren't you?
And if my guess is right, Crawley, there's a bit of malice in your soul toward me, isn't there?
Crawley didn't have much success with Rebecca, but he ought to have more luck this time.
And the bride will be grateful for your fraternal arm, Crawley, in a week or so.
Every time she faints, in fact.
De Winter!
Maxim, please!
That temper of yours will do you in yet, Max.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Now is there anything else?
You might bring Mr. De Winter a sedative.
No, no. Nothing at all.
Just leave us. - Very good.
Now, Favell, let's get this business over.
As you seem to have worked out the whole thing so carefully, perhaps you can provide us also with a motive.
I knew you were going to bring that up, Colonel.
I've read enough detective stories to know that there must always be a motive.
And if you'll all excuse me, I might supply that, too.
I wish you'd go home.
You ought not to be here through all this.
Please let me stay, Maxim.
Surely, Colonel Julyan, you're not going to allow this fellow to...
My opinion of Favell is no higher than yours, Crawley.
But in my official capacity, I have no alternative but to pursue his accusations.
I entirely agree with you, Colonel.
In matters as serious as this, we must make sure of every point and explore every avenue.
And in fact, if I may coin a phrase, leave no stone unturned.
Here she is, the missing link, the witness who will help supply the motive.
Colonel Julyan, Mrs. Danvers. I believe you know everyone else.
Won't you sit down?
No offense, Colonel, but I think I'll put this to Danny.
She'll understand it more easily.
Danny, who was Rebecca's doctor?
Mrs. De Winter always had Dr. McClean from the village.
Now, you heard. I said Rebecca's doctor in London.
I don't know anything about that.
Oh, don't give me that, Danny.
You knew everything about Rebecca.
You knew she was in love with me, didn't you?
Surely you haven't forgotten the good times she and I used to have down at the cottage on the beach.
She had a right to amuse herself, didn't she?
Love was a game to her. Only a game.
It made her laugh, I tell you.
She used to sit and rock with laughter at the lot of you.
Can you think of why Mrs. De Winter should have taken her own life?
No, no. I refuse to believe it.
I knew everything about her and I won't believe it. There.
You see? It's impossible. She knows that as well as I do.
Now, listen to me, Danny. We know that Rebecca went to a doctor in London on the last day of her life.
Who was it?
I don't know.
I understand, Danny.
You think we're asking you to reveal secrets of Rebecca's life.
You're trying to defend her. But that's what I'm doing.
I'm trying to clear her name of the suspicion of suicide.
Mrs. Danvers, it has been suggested that Mrs. De Winter was deliberately murdered.
There you have it in a nutshell, Danny.
But there's one more thing you'll want to know, the name of the murderer.
It's a lovely name that rolls off the tongue so easily.
George Fortescue Maximilian de Winter.
There was a doctor.
Mrs. De Winter sometimes went to him privately.
She used to go to him even before she was married.
We don't want reminiscences, Danny.
Dr. Baker.
165 Goldhawk Road, Shepherd's Bush.
There you are, Colonel.
There's where you'll find your motive.
Go and question Dr. Baker. He'll tell you why Rebecca went to him.
To confirm the fact that she was going to have a child.
A sweet, curly-headed little child.
It isn't true. It isn't true. She would have told me.
She told Max about it. Max knew he wasn't the father.
So, like the gentleman of the old school that he is, he killed her.
I'm afraid we shall have to question this Dr. Baker.
Hear, hear.
But for safety's sake, I think I'd like to go along, too.
Yes. Unfortunately, I suppose you have the right to ask that.
I'll see the coroner and have the inquest postponed pending further evidence.
I say, aren't you rather afraid that the prisoner, shall we say, might bolt?
You have my word for it that he will not do that.
Toodle-oo, Max. Come along, Danny.
Let's leave the unhappy couple to spend their last moments together alone.
Are you sure you don't want me to go with you, Max?
No, darling. It'll be very tiring for you.
I'll be back the very first thing in the morning.
And I won't even stop to sleep.
I'll be waiting for you.
Ready, Maxim?
Yes.
You two go on ahead. I'll follow with Favell.
Dr. Baker, you may have seen
Mr. De Winter's name in the papers recently.
Yes. Yes. In connection with the body that was found in a boat.
My wife was reading all about it. A very sad case.
My condolences. This is going to take hours.
Let me...
Don't bother, Favell. I think I can tell Dr. Baker.
We're trying to discover certain facts concerning the late Mrs. De Winter's activities on the day of her death.
October the 12th, last year.
I want you to tell me if you can, if anyone of that name paid you a visit on that date?
I'm awfully sorry. I'm afraid I can't help you.
I should have remembered the name de Winter.
I've never attended a Mrs. De Winter in my life.
How can you possibly tell all your patients' names?
I can look it up in my engagement diary if you like.
Did you say the 12th of October?
Yes.
Here we are.
No. No de Winter.
Are you sure?
Well, here are all the appointments for that day.
Ross, Campbell, Steadall, Perrino, Danvers...
Danny? What the devil?
Would you read that name again?
Did you say Danvers?
Yes. I have a Mrs. Danvers for 3:00.
What did she look like? Can you remember?
Yes, I remember her quite well.
She was a very beautiful woman.
Tall, dark, exquisitely dressed.
Rebecca.
The lady must have used an assumed name.
Is that so?
This is a surprise.
I've known her a long time.
What was the matter with her?
Well, there are certain ethics.
Could you supply a reason, Dr. Baker, for Mrs. De Winter's suicide?
For her murder, you mean?
She was going to have a kid, wasn't she?
Come on. Out with it!
Tell me, what else would a woman of her class be doing in a dump like this?
I take it the official nature of this visit makes it necessary for me to...
I assure you we'd not be troubling you if it were not necessary.
You want to know if I can suggest any motive as to why Mrs. De Winter should have taken her life?
Yes, I think I can.
The woman who called herself Mrs. Danvers was very seriously ill.
She was not going to have a child?
That was what she thought.
My diagnosis was different.
I sent her to a well-known specialist for an examination and x-rays.
And on this date, she returned to me for his report.
I remember her standing here holding out her hand for the photograph.
I want to know the truth, " she said.
I don't want soft words and a bedside manner.
If I'm for it, you can tell me right away. "
I knew she was not the type to accept a lie.
She'd asked for the truth, so I let her have it.
She thanked me.
I never saw her again, so I assumed...
What was wrong with her?
Cancer.
Yes, the growth was deep-rooted.
An operation would have been no earthly use at all.
In a short time, she would have been under morphia.
There was nothing that could be done for her, except wait.
Did she say anything when you told her?
She smiled in a queer sort of way.
Your wife was a wonderful woman, Mr. De Winter.
And, oh, yes, I remember she said something that struck me as being very peculiar at the time.
When I told her it was a matter of months, she said,
Oh, no, Doctor, not that long. "
You've been very kind.
You've told us all we wanted to know.
We shall need an official verification.
Verification?
Yes. - To confirm the verdict of suicide.
I understand.
Can I offer you gentlemen a glass of sherry?
No, that's very kind. I think we ought to be going.
Thank heaven we know the truth.
Dreadful thing. Dreadful.
Young and lovely woman like that. No wonder...
I never had the remotest idea.
Neither did Danny, I'm sure.
I wish I had a drink.
Will we be needed at the inquest any further, Colonel Julyan?
No, no.
I can see to it that Maxim's not troubled any further. - Thank you, sir.
You ready to start, Colonel?
No, thank you.
I'm staying in town tonight.
And let me tell you, Favell, blackmail is not much of a profession.
And we know how to deal with it in our part of the world, strange as it may seem to you.
I'm sure I don't know what you're talking about.
But if you ever need a new car, Colonel, just let me know.
It's impossible to thank you for your kindness to us through all this.
You know what I feel without my saying it.
Not at all. Put the whole thing behind you.
But let your wife know. She'll be getting worried.
Yes, of course. I'll phone her at once and we'll get straight down to Manderley.
Goodbye, Crawley.
Maxim's got a great friend.
Frank.
Yes, Maxim?
There's something you don't know.
Oh, no, there isn't.
I didn't kill her, Frank.
But I know now that when she told me about the child, she wanted me to kill her.
She lied on purpose. She foresaw the whole thing.
That's why she stood there laughing when she...
Don't think about it anymore.
Thank you, Frank.
Hello, Danny.
I just wanted to tell you the news.
Rebecca held out on both of us.
She had cancer.
Yes, suicide.
Now Max and that dear little bride of his will be able to stay on at Manderley and live happily ever after.
Bye-bye, Danny.
This your car, sir?
Will you be going soon?
This isn't a parking place, you know.
Oh, isn't it?
Well, people are entitled to leave cars outside if they want to.
It's a pity some of you fellows haven't anything better to do.
When you phoned, did she say she'd wait up?
I asked her to go to bed, but she wouldn't hear of it.
I wish I could get some more speed out of this thing.
Is something worrying you, Maxim?
I can't get over the feeling something's wrong.
Frank.
What's the matter?
Why did we stop?
What's the time?
Well, this clock's wrong.
It must be 3:00 or 4:00. Why?
That can't be the dawn breaking over there.
It's in the winter that you see the northern lights, isn't it?
That's not the northern lights.
That's Manderley.
Frith! Frith!
Mrs. De Winter. Where is she?
I thought I saw her, sir.
Maxim!
Thank heavens you've come back to me!
Are you all right, darling?
Oh, yes, I am.
Are you all right?
Mrs. Danvers, she's gone mad.
She said she'd rather destroy Manderley than see us happy here.
Look!
The west wing!
I never know why men come back From sea
Theseais cruel but the sea is clean
Thecauseof thisvastpurity Must be
Thatmenat sea are few and far between
Hardship is all she ever gave to me
AndyetIask  why men come back from sea
The sea is cruel but the sea is clean
Oh,poorbrownearth How kind you might have been
The princess - Have you got news for me?
No, Master.
Dead?
You followed my orders?
Yes, Master.
And the blind man?
He has been found.
Alms, for the love of Allah.
Alms, for the love of Allah.
Your cur would bark? A fine reward for charity.
If charity be false as that coin.
Then you cheat, son of a burnt father.
A blind man cannot tell truth from false.
Alas, I cannot tell day from night. It was my dog.
How can a dog tell bad from good?
See for yourself.
Now, by the wonder of Allah!
It is a false coin, and I, myself, knew it not!
Come, O frequenter of tree trunks... now which is the bad one?
This is no dog, but the reincarnation of a tax collector!
O ye whom Allah gave the gift of sight... to fill your eyes with beauty and delight... spare me a thought to whom your wondrous world... is but a city of eternal night.
Alms, for the love of Allah.
Bring him to me.
Alms, for the love of Allah.
Pray for me.
My name is Halima.
I do not know you?
Does one always know one's friends?
I have none to know.
Can you not trust in one who brings not words, but deeds?
In my house, there is food and rest.
And what is mine is yours.
Why should you offer this?
For your prayers.
That is much for little.
Take my hand.
There's no need. My dog sees for me.
He gives me more than ever he can receive, like all dogs.
This is a sleep beyond my knowledge. Only this I know:
When the blind man comes to her, she will be cured.
Strange, Master, he can do something all your powers cannot.
I'll make him do it for me and cast him away.
But she loves the blind man.
Do you call the lisping of two children in a garden love?
Love she has yet to learn.
And I am here to teach her.
Poor blind beggar.
Even more unfortunate than you know.
That cannot be.
But we are unveiled.
And I am... veiled.
Tell us your name.
Ahmad. - Ahmad!
Ahmad, you'll beg no more.
Nor journey on.
Stay here with us.
O sovereigns of silkiness, I am sure you are beautiful... but for me there is no staying.
I must on, seeking the one I love, whom I have lost.
Men with two eyes often seek all their lives and fail to find that one.
Stay.
There are great doctors here. They may restore your sight.
That would be the blackest day of all my days.
You talk in riddles.
I will give you the answer.
There was once a king, son of a king and of a hundred kings.
His subjects countless, his wealth untellable... his power absolute.
And this dog was not a dog... but a youth who lived in Bagdad and became dear to the king.
But in those days, he was nothing but a little thief.
Why do you smell my fish, master of a copper coin?
Be off!
Shall I call the khadi's clubmen?
Stop, thief!
Stop, thief!
Stop that thief!
Ahmad the king.
Son of Akbar, grandson of Haroun-el-Rachid... the great, the illustrious... lord of the earth, defender of the faith... servant of the all-highest... but master of all men.
Ahmad the king!
Ahmad the king.
Alas, I was that mighty man.
365 wives were mine.
In my heart there was no love.
Fifty palaces, and I had no home.
Richest among my subjects, I was the poorest of the poor.
Every desire satisfied, I grew empty of desire.
And in my whole vast kingdom, I could find nothing to do - no task, no aim, no purpose - for always my grand vizierJaffar stood between me and my people.
Another execution.
Why had he to die?
He had been thinking, my lord and master.
Is it a crime then to think?
In a subject, it's quite unpardonable.
Are men only to be ruled by fear?
Men are evil - hatred behind their eyes, lies on their lips, betrayal in their hearts.
You will learn one day, great king... that there are about three things that men respect:
the lash that descends, the yoke that breaks and the sword that slays.
By the power and terror of these, you may conquer the earth.
Do I want to conquer the earth?
What do you want, my lord and master?
I thought I might try to give them happiness.
Happiness.
They are fools and knaves.
Your grandsire knew it, and if you would know it too... do as he did.
One night, when darkness falls... leave your palace, go among your people... mix with the crowds, go into their houses... listen, observe and remember.
Tonight,Jaffar.
Tonight, my king.
Your people, my king.
I've never been so close to them.
Go. Listen, observe and remember.
It is told, though Allah be wiser or more merciful... there was in the past of the ages a king among kings... a master of arms and of armies, of vessels and auxiliaries.
And this master of time and people was an oppressor to both... and the earth was as pitch in the faces ofhis subjects and his slaves.
What's he saying?
And they groaned together in secret. Why, I don't know.
Is it the king he's talking about?
Don't ask questions.
There are spies everywhere. You must be careful in Bagdad.
I'm a stranger here.
Surely you can tell me what the old man's talking about.
Oh, about foolish hopes... about a prophecy, about a liberator.
Only fools and children believe it.
A liberator indeed. Not while Ahmad is king.
And they groaned together in secret and were slain in the marketplace.
But a wise man among the sages of Bagdad comforted them with a prophecy... saying, "In the fullness of years, a liberator shall come upon you...
and this shall be the sign ofhim:
he shall be the lowest of the low... and you shall look for him in the clouds. "
And the people cried, "We shall look for him in the clouds indeed...
for if the great are powerless to save us from this tyrant... how can one of no account avail?"
And the reader of the Milky Way replied...
Have faith, trust in Allah...
for there, one day in the blue, you shall see a boy...
the lowest of the low, mounted upon a cloud.
But the cloud shall be as strong as the hills beneath the snow...
and from the ranges of the sky... he shall destroy this tyrant with the arrow ofjustice. "
What is the name of the tyrant?
Ahmad. - Ahmad. - Ahmad.
I wish the miracle would happen today.
I wish he would die today.
Put him in prison.
When he says he's the king, tell them he's a madman.
His friends and all who might be loyal to him must be destroyed.
I learned that night not that men are evil, but that he was evil.
When he persuaded me among my people, he laid a trap for me.
I was thrown into prison... and there, in prison, my life began... for there I met the one who was to become my only true friend -
Abu, the little thief of Bagdad.
For only very little thieves are thrown into prison.
Not in prison! No! No!
Not in prison! - Don't put me in prison!
No! - Come in, thief.
Cut off his right arm, and then his left.
Then his left leg, then his right.
And then his head.
No! No! No!
I say no! No! Please, no!
Don't kill me!
I don't want to die!
And as for the madman, our great sultan Jaffar is merciful.
Only his head. As the sun rises.
No! No, no!
No! No, no!
Poor boy, they've driven you mad.
Me mad?
Theyjust said you were mad.
Are you really mad?
That's it. I'm mad. I must be mad.
The maddest of all the madmen that ever lived in the sultan's palace.
You are mad, quite mad.
What's it matter?
In the morning, unless the sun stops still and never rises, we both die - the thief and the madman- and I don't want to die.
You are not mad... and maybe we shall watch the sun rise from over the river.
Didn't you hear the jailer?
As the sun rises."
As the sun rises, we'll take a boat and go down to the sea.
I've never seen the sea... but I've heard the sailors on the riverside talk about it.
In the sea are fishes as big as the great temple... and little ones as tiny as my little finger, with wings.
And boats as big as Bagdad itself... with sails as big as clouds.
And when the wind blows, they go as fast as antelopes... and carry you to the isles of India and China.
To the isles of India and China.
And we're locked in prison.
The ax will fall as the sun rises.
And you say you're not mad.
Look! - What's that?
The key of the prison. I just stole it.
The key?
Give it to me!
Steady, steady.
You want someone to look after you. We can't go now.
Why not?
We must wait.
In an hour they will eat. After they eat, they sleep.
Then we go.
Hurry! Catch this oar.
Give me that rope! Hurry! We must get away.
Do you want us to be killed?
Do you think they will have mercy on us?
Don't you think if the king knew, he'd be merciful?
The king was a fool.
I hope he suffers as much as he made the people suffer.
Do you hate him so much?
Everybody hated him.
Oh, if I could only lay my hands on him just once... if I could only tell him what a fool he was.
Tell it now.
I am Ahmad the king.
Speak.
Ahmad the king is dead. He died yesterday.
There's a new king,Jaffar.
Look!
Jaffar would not make all that fuss over me. He would not send the whole guard after me.
Mercy, Master. I'm your slave.
Leave me at least one arm for small stealing, and I'll pay you twice as much in taxes.
What's your name?
I'm Abu the thief... son of Abu the thief, grandson of Abu the thief.
Most unfortunate of 1 0 sons with a hunger that yawns day and night.
Get up, my little friend.
We must return to Bagdad.
How can you be such a fool?
I mean, my king would be killed.
A dead king and a dead thief cannot do much, you know.
If your fingers are as nimble as your brain, you are indeed the prince of thieves.
Come on. Let's catch the morning breeze. That will carry us to freedom.
Freedom. Strange.
I've had everything but freedom.
And I've had nothing but freedom.
And now we've got it, what shall we do with it?
Anything we like.
In three days, we shall be in Basra.
Here. Take this pole.
I want to be a sailor Sailing out to sea
No plowboy, tinker, tailor is any fun to be
Aunts and cousins By the baker's dozens
Drive a man to sea or highway robbery
I want to be a bandit Can'tyouunderstandit
Sailing to sea is life for me Is life for me
Abu!
Basra!
Basra.
How beautiful it looks.
How beautiful it smells!
Pancakes!
Give me one!
Really, you are a fool.
Whoever heard of eating pancakes without honey?
But how can you steal honey?
Allah give us the pancakes, and he will provide honey.
Honey! Honey! Honey!
You buy honey?
Yes, we are thinking of buying some.
Uh, a jar, of course.
Uh, if it's good honey.
The best in Basra.
Uh, easy to say. First I must try.
I've tasted better.
What do you think?
No, not good enough.
No. Your bees are out ofhumor.
Take better care of them.
Hey, old friend.
Whose palace is this?
Why, the palace of the sultan, children of ignorance.
The palace of a thousand toys.
Where have you come from, you beggars of no importance?
Don't you know that the sultan has the greatest collection of toys in the world?
Why toys?
The sultan is an old man, and old men are like children.
He guards his toys more jealously... than he guards his daughter.
But I say no more.
Now out of my way, you masters of a thousand fleas.
Allah be with you, but I doubt it.
What's happening? - Let me go!
Not until you've told us.
Then why does everybody go?
It's death to look on her.
Death?
Why? No man has ever seen her, nor shall, till her father gives her in marriage.
Is she so ugly?
Her beauty is like the sun and the moon.
Let me go!
Let us go!
Where?
Up there!
Your eating will cause our death.
Without eating, we die.
Here they come!
I must see her again.
But I've found Sinbad the sailor. And he has given us two places on his ship.
It is more wonderful than I'd ever imagined. And on the next tide, she sails.
I can't go.
I must see her again.
But, Ahmad, all my life I dreamt of going in a great ship across the world.
I can't go.
I must see her again.
If I help you to see her, will you then come with me?
I will.
O throbbing heart of mine
Be still today
We must await the word That all men say
And when, O heart of mine It comes to you
Leap up Remembering
It might Be true
It might be true No more.
The music of a love song is as heavy as the noonday air.
Let us wait for the nightingale and the night. To the pool.
A djinni!
A djinni!
A djinni. Don't go! Don't go.
A djinni.
Are you afraid?
Yes.
Terribly.
Why don't you run away?
I want to look.
I've never seen a djinni before.
Well, then what do you see? Remember always, to a djinni, you must tell the truth.
You don't look wicked.
Are you a good djinni?
Not too good.
Very good djinni are just as tiresome as very good men.
Do you live down there?
No.
Why have you come?
To see you.
I was about to bathe.
I'm waiting.
Bathe, with you there?
Give me your hand then. Down into the water.
Oh, djinni, you've gone.
I didn't mean you to go so soon.
Shall I never see you again? Never?
Don't be afraid.
I'm not a djinni.
Who are you?
Your slave.
Where have you come from?
From the other side of time...
to find you.
How long have you been searching?
Since time began.
Now that you've found me, how long will you stay?
Till the end of time.
For me, there can be no more beauty in the world but yours.
For me, there can be no more pleasure in the world... than to please you.
Will you be here in the garden tomorrow at the same hour?
There's a gardener here who watches night and day.
His name is Death.
You mustn't come.
Forbid me then.
I cannot forbid.
Tomorrow!
And all tomorrows.
Did you see her?
I did.
Good! Then we can go with Sinbad tonight.
No, Abu. I can't go.
Why not?
You have seen her again.
That's why I can't go - because I have seen her.
All right.
Then I'll go alone.
If you go there tomorrow again... how will you pass the guards without me to help?
Oh, I'll find a way.
You'll be caught.
You'll stay with me?
Oh, Abu, why should you?
You have as great a longing in your soul as I have.
Why should you stay with me?
Because I'm as great a fool as you are.
Brother of lions.
Fountain of hospitality.
You know, I have the largest collection of these mechanical devices... in the whole wide world.
And this is the most remarkable of them all.
I-It tells the time.
See how it works?
Sheer magic, isn't it?
I hope this dangerous device will never be allowed into the hands of the people.
Dangerous?
Yes.
If people once begin to know the time... they will no longer call you the king of time.
They will want to know how time is spent.
Oh, you're right.
Oh, the people must never know.
Look, look. Come. Ah!
See. Such workmanship.
Such - Such precision.
Such reliability.
I do so prefer these things to my subjects.
Watch. Watch. See.
That's the finest of them all.
I have only to wind a key or press a spring - and they do exactly the same thing every time... and exactly what I want.
And so often my subjects fail to do exactly what I want... and then I have to have their heads cut off.
Your collection is indeed magnificent... and so near completion too.
Near completion? Huh.
I'd have you know my collection is-is the most complete completion.
Please, do not misunderstand me.
I am well aware that nothing short of a miracle could add luster... to this already dazzling display.
But such a miracle does exist.
A mechanical toy better than - than any of mine?
Knowing of your interest in these matters, I have brought it with me.
Well, let's see it. Let's see it.
Quickly, quickly!
Oh, I can't bear to be kept waiting.
This is exciting, this.
If Your Highness would wind it yourself.
What's it going to do? Hmm?
Move its legs, or arch its neck?
Or wag its tail?
It doesn't kick, does it?
To tell you the truth, I'm always rather nervous of these things... till I know what they're going to do, till I get used to them.
It wants some winding.
If Your Highness would mount.
And now?
Pull the reins!
I am no longer a man.
I am a bird!
I'm the king of birds!
Oh.
Mmm, I want it! I want it.
I must have it, and I'll give you anything you wish for it.
It's yours.
I ask but one thing in return.
Anything you will.
Your daughter. - My daughter?
Mm-hmm.
Oh, dear, dear, dear. Really.
This is -This is very awkward. Wh
What do you want my daughter for?
I have to found a dynasty.
Oh, quite, quite, quite.
I understand entirely about founding a dynasty. Delightful thing to do.
I've tried myself, many times.
And what have I got? A daughter.
The true offspring of the mother of miseries.
Her eyes have quarreled. They're always trying to get at one another.
Her eyes are Babylonian eyes... and her eyebrows like the crescent moon of Ramadan.
Her body's straight as the letter alif.
How do you know? - I've seen her.
Oh, no, you -
I have.
Where?
In my crystal.
Oh, confound your crystal. Confound all crystals. I always did hate the things.
I have some skill.
Oh, say no more.
Anyhow, I - I must have this horse.
So I suppose you must have my daughter.
I will never marry him. I would rather die.
I will go to my sister, who's married to he sultan of Samarkand.
She will protect me.
Go back to the garden.
You will find someone there whom we thought was the djinni of the pool.
Tell him of our misfortune, and tell him that I will wait for him in Samarkand.
Yes, Princess.
Your Highness, the princess is nowhere to be found.
She is gone.
We have searched the whole garden. - We have found only two beggars. - Bring them here.
Jaffar!
Jaffar!
Jaffar!
At last, face to face, man to man, sword to sword.
Give me a sword! Allah will judge!
Great sultan, I speak the truth. My eyes bear witness.
Ahmad!
My eyes!
I'm blind!
Ahmad!
Listen, great sultan, I know the truth.
You must know who this man is!
Listen, good people.
Son of a dog.
By this, my magic rune... be what your fathers were... and bay the moon.
And this is my curse:
You shall remain a dog... and you shall walk in the darkness of the blind... until I hold her in my arms.
And now, dispensers of bounty, you know why a blind man with his dog... searches the world for a lost love, and with little enough hope.
Yet without that hope, there would be nothing.
And Allah is merciful.
Allah is merciful indeed, for the one that you seek is here.
If you mock me, Allah will not forgive. I do not mock.
Your princess was captured by slave traders and sold here in our slave market.
The richest merchant in the town bought her.
But no sooner was she taken to his house than she fell into the strangest trance.
She lives, but is as dead.
No doctor can restore her.
Night and day she calls upon the djinni of the pool. - I was that djinni!
And you alone can bring her back to life.
Can you take me where she is?
O djinni, shall I never see you again?
Lead me to her.
Why have you come?
To find you.
How long have you been searching?
From the beginning of time.
Now that you've found me, how long will you stay?
Till the end of time.
The dream - my dream - always the same dream.
This is no dream.
Ahmad!
Finish the masquerade.
Don't look at me like that.
Suffering has left its mark.
For me, your beauty will always be as I first saw it - never changing.
Your eyes
They're so strange.
So full of pain.
One cannot go through fire and not be scorched.
Ahmad, you must go.
The master has returned.
I will hide you, and when the master sleeps in the heat of the noon...
I'll bring her to you.
Quiet.
From now you're not only mine. You belong to the princess as well.
Stay and guard her for me.
Blind.
He's blind.
It is in your power to restore his sight.
There is, in this town, a famous doctor who would, at your request, cure him.
Take me.
Is the doctor here, on this ship? Yes.
He's waiting for you.
Open this door.
Open it!
Bring him nearer.
Nearer.
How do you find your dog's life, hmm?
Strange how an unpleasant child can be a decent dog.
Throw him overboard.
Welcome.
Jaffar!
Yes.Jaffar. It's always Jaffar.
Since you left your palace, I have kept you safe.
When you rode hopeless and lost in the desert, who guided you?
When you were sold in the slave market, who bought you?
Always Jaffar.
It was in my house you were cared for, to sleep your sleep... and dream to its end... your first dream of love.
It was I who woke you. No.
It was Ahmad.
I was told there was a doctor here... who could restore his sight.
But I am that doctor.
The same moment that I hold you in my arms...
Ahmad will see.
Take me in your arms.
My eyes!
Ahmad!
Can you see?
I'm Abu again!
Abu!
She's with him -Jaffar- on the ship.
What good are my eyes to me without her?
Is there nothing for you without her?
Nothing.
No. No.
I have powers that could force you to my will.
But I want more than they can give.
I want your love.
Forget Ahmad.
He's no longer blind.
And for a man with eyes, the world is full of women.
Only I am cursed... that I can see only you.
Trying to end your life before it has begun.
I tell you, Ahmad has forgotten.
Look!
It's Ahmad!
Wind!
Wind!
Wind!
Whip yourself, winds of heaven! Whip till you wail aloud!
Ahmad!
Ahmad!
Ahmad!
Why do you refuse to obey your destiny?
You behave like a slave girl.
I am a slave girl.
You could command me. Try.
Ask what you will.
Would you take me back to Basra?
Helmsman!
Master!
Northward to Basra.
This is a place of desolation.
It is the most beautiful garden in the world.
If there were ever flowers in it, they've vanished, like cancer.
And the pool - so dark with weeds... you can't even see your own reflection in it.
I'm not looking for my own reflection.
Father, I don't want to go to Bagdad with Jaffar.
Don't let him take me.
Don't!
Oh, there, there, there, there, there, there.
Well, if you don't want to go to Bagdad with him, you shan't. No. Never.
Never, never, never. Never while I live. There.
What is it?
The newest magical toy: the silver maid.
Does she do anything more?
She can embrace you.
But any of my wives will do that.
Her embrace will thrill you... as no other woman ever has... or ever will.
Do you mean I might get rid of all my wives... and have a collection of these things?
She tickles!
Guards!
Make ready for Bagdad.
Free!
Free! Free!
Free again!
Free, after 2,000 years!
2,000 years ago, King Solomon, master of all the djinns... imprisoned me within that bottle.
For me, this is the first moment of my new freedom.
For you, this is the last moment of your life.
My life?
Your life!
In a moment I shall lift my foot and crush you... insect, beetle, worm that you are!
But, sheik of spirits, I fished you out of the sea. I opened your bottle. I let you out.
You can't be so ungrateful.
Ungrateful?
Slaves are not grateful.
Listen. Inside my bottle for the first thousand years...
I swore that I'd enrich the one that freed me with all the riches of the earth.
But in the second thousand years, my imprisoned spirit turned to vengeance... on all that lived and were free.
And I swore that I'd kill him that freed me to satisfy that hate.
Are you ready?
Wait! Wait!
Wait! Wait!
Please, before I die, may I -
May I ask one question?
Ask.
How comes it that you, as big as a mountain... could ever get into that bottle I can hold in my hand?
You weren't ever in it really, were you?
Of course I was.
Oh, no, you weren't.
I was!
You weren't!
What? You dare doubt?
If I'm going to die in a moment, I can dare anything, and I say it's impossible.
Impossible?
And I don't believe you.
Take care.
And never shall.
Never?
Nothing can make me!
Nothing?
Nothing. Unless I see it with my own eyes.
Then, dog of an unbeliever, before you die... you shall see, with me, nothing is impossible!
You shall see and believe!
Now, you great, overblown belch!
Let me out! Let me out!
Just because you were bigger than me, you thought you could bully.
Let me out! Let me out!
Product of inflation.
Descendant of a stink.
I'm going to throw you back into the sea.
This time forever.
Oh, no. Mercy!
Mercy, O Master!
What's that? - O great and merciful master!
Say that again.
O great and merciful master... let me out, and I'll grant you three wishes.
Three wishes?
Your first three wishes shall come true.
You swear?
I swear.
By King Solomon, master of all the djinn?
By King Solomon, the master of all the djinn... the oath that no spirit can break.
And you'll behave?
No threatening and shouting?
No. - No what?
No, Master.
Now, don't make so much noise again.
You frightened me before.
Master, I hear and obey.
That's better.
All bullies must learn manners in the end.
I'm hungry.
Can't think with my stomach empty.
I wish I had some of those sausages Mother used to make.
Your sausages, Master.
That was the first wish, Master.
Two more remain.
Name them. Don't you hurry me. I've got to be careful.
Two more.
You know what I wish?
Tell me. Where is my friend Ahmad?
Master, to know that, you must look into the All-Seeing Eye.
Then give me the eye.
Master, I can take you where it is... but not even I can steal it for you.
Steal?
Huh! I'll see to that.
Little braggart. What have you ever stolen?
What haven't I?
A key from its lock, ring from its finger, money from its purse, the strength of a djinni -
And the tongue of a liar!
But he who would steal the All-Seeing Eye... from the very brow of the goddess must be neither a thief nor a braggart, but a hero.
I always wanted to be a hero.
Then catch on to my hair.
All right.
But mind you, this is not my second wish yet.
Now I'm rather helping you.
Yes, Master.
Djinni!
Djinni!
I'm frightened!
I hear!
All right, Master?
I think so.
Where are we now?
Above the roof of the world.
Has the world got a roof?
Of course, supported by seven pillars.
And the seven pillars are set on the shoulders of a djinni whose strength is beyond thought.
And the djinni stands on an eagle... and the eagle on a bull, and the bull on a fish.
And the fish swims in the Sea of Eternity.
Where are we going?
On the highest peak of the highest mountain of the world... where earth meets the sky, and there is the Temple of the Dawn.
And in the great hall of the temple is the goddess of light.
And in the head of the goddess is the All-Seeing Eye.
And now, my little braggart... you can be a thief and a hero all in one.
A hero.
I want to be a sailor
I want to be a sailor, sailing out to sea.
No plowboy, tinker, tailor is any fun to be
Aunts and cousins - By the baker's dozens - By the baker's dozens
Drive a man to sea or highway robbery - I - I
Want to be a bandit Can't you understand it Can'tyouunderstandit
Djinni! Djinni!
Get me out ofhere, quick!
Quick!
Djinni! Djinni! Help!
Djinni, help! Djinni!
Is this the All-Seeing Eye?
Not for 2,000 years will she grow another.
For a hundred generations of men, she will not know their doings.
Now shall I know what happened to Ahmad?
Look. Look hard.
It's true. It's Ahmad.
Help!
Help!
Help!
Now my second wish. Take me to him.
To hear is to obey, little master of the world.
Hold tight, little brother.
We have to return half across the world.
Don't be afraid, Ahmad!
It's me, Abu!
Abu!
Put me down! Put me down!
Gently, you clumsy good-for-nothing!
Abu!
Ahmad!
Allah be merciful.
It's a real djinni. Yes.
He's mine, and I am his master.
I am your master, aren't I?
To hear is to obey, O Master!
He brought me here, and he'll carry us away.
What's he laughing like that for?
I don't like the sound of it.
Oh, he's all right.
He's a bit big to talk to. That's the worse part about him.
You have to shout so much.
Hey, you up there!
What are you laughing for?
For my freedom. It is at hand.
You get us out of this place.
Your third wish?
No, no, no, no.
Not yet.
He is big, but he is sharp.
I've got to be careful.
Only one wish left.
I have only one wish.
Oh, I know all about that.
Your princess.
If only I could see her again.
Is that all?
I don't need to waste a wish for that.
Look. - What's that?
Look into it - hard, hard.
Keep staring into it. You'll see her.
It's true!
A blue rose?
I've heard about that.
That - That's the Blue Rose of Forgetfulness.
If she inhales its fragrance, she'll forget... everything.
Blue roses?
Exquisite.
Who are you?
I don't know.
I've forgotten.
Why have you suffered?
Have I suffered?
I don't remember.
It seems I was in love.
Whom did you love?
I cannot tell.
I don't know any longer.
I can't look anymore!
There are worse things than blindness.
Knowledge can be more terrible than ignorance, if one can do nothing.
Why did you give me this?
Take it back and break it into a thousand pieces.
I only stole it to help you.
You stole it because you enjoy stealing.
Without my stealing, you'd be dead.
I wish I were dead.
I wish I'd never seen you.
I wish - I wish I were in Bagdad.
I wish you were!
Ahmad!
Ahmad!
Ahmad!
Ahmad!
Where are you?
Where you wished him - on his way to Bagdad.
Then take me out of this place. Don't you hear?
I want to get out.
You stay where you are.
You're a clever little man, little master of the universe... but mortals are weak and frail.
If their stomach speaks, they forget their brain.
If their brain speaks, they forget their hearts.
And if their hearts speak -
If their hearts speak, they forget everything!
Am I not your master?
No longer.
You've had your three wishes, and I am free!
Free!
Djinni! Djinni!
Come back!
Don't leave me here! Don't let me die!
And farewell, little master of the universe.
Farewell!
Free!
Free! Free!
Everything of the past is forgotten.
You have been in love with me.
You are in love with me.
You will always love me.
Everything of the past is forgotten.
I have been in love with you.
I am in love with you.
I shall always love you.
Jaffar!
Ahmad.
Put them in prison.
Chain them to opposite walls.
In the morning, they die the death of a thousand cuts.
I have failed, my love.
Forgive me.
I have no regrets.
We are together.
And shall be for the rest of our lives.
We shall never again know the torture of being apart.
And if death is not the end, we shall go on together.
Abu and I parted quarreling.
I wish I could tell him I'm sorry.
Abu, my friend... good-bye and forgive me.
I won't say good-bye.
I'll help.
But how? How?
If I can't help, I won't see!
Welcome, our prince.
Welcome, little prince.
Father of a beard, there's some mistake.
I'm not a prince.
I'm only a thief.
For you we have been waiting twice 2,000 years. Oh, no.
Not waiting for me... because I didn't know I was coming, and I don't know how I've come.
Who are you, father of miracles?
And where am I?
This is the Land of Legend... where everything is possible when seen through the eyes of youth.
We are the remnant of the Golden Age.
Golden because gold was nothing.
No more than the sand beneath your feet... or the stone that we became.
How did you become stone?
We were petrified with horror... by the evil done among men... when they ceased to be children... and to believe in the beauty of the impossible.
But whenever the heart of a child returns to us... and comes into us... we live again.
And so, as that child... you are to be my successor.
Now, come with me... and I will present you with two insignia... of true kingship.
Here they are.
Aim this only at injustice, and you cannot fail.
Oh, no, father of kindness. I don't want it.
I don't want to be a king.
I only want to save my friend.
Well, this will help you. Take it.
And now...
I do homage... for you are king... and all in our kingdom is yours... except that carpet, which I keep for myself.
For on that carpet... which flies when it is bidden - "Fly, carpet" -
I shall go to paradise at the hour appointed.
It is told, though Allah is wiser or more merciful... there was in the past of the ages a king among kings... a master of arms and of armies, of vessels and auxiliaries.
And this master of time and people was an oppressor to both... until the earth was as pitch on the faces ofhis subjects and his slaves... and they groaned together in secret... and were slayed in the marketplace.
But a wise man among the sages of Bagdad... comforted them with a prophecy, saying...
In the fullness of time, a liberator shall come upon you... and this shall be the sign ofhim. "
O Allah, I know you don't much like stealing.
I'll never steal again.
You can trust me.
Just this once more.Just this little carpet so as to get to Bagdad in time.
When the old king's hour comes... he won't want a carpet to fly to paradise.
Then you, O Allah, will take him by the hand... gentle and kind as he is... and lead him into eternal bliss.
Aren't I right?
But I must go to Bagdad to save my friend.
It's a question of minutes.
You must see that.
O Allah, lord ofjustice, let me steal.
Fly, carpet.
Wait.
Fly, carpet!
Why do you close your eyes?
There's little time left to see him.
The people cried, "We shall look for him in the clouds indeed...
for if the great are powerless to save us from this tyrant... how can one of no account avail?"
And the reader of the Milky Way replied...
Have faith, trust in Allah...
for there, one day in the blue, you shall see a boy...
the lowest of the low, mounted on a cloud... "and that cloud shall be as strong as the hills beneath the snow...
and from the ranges of the sky... he shall destroy this tyrant with the arrow ofjustice. "
The horse!
Up, quickly!
Ahmad!
Jaffar!
My people, I owe everything to Abu... and when he grows into a man, he shall be my grand vizier.
He shall be sent to the best school in Bagdad... and all the wise men of the East shall teach him all the wisdom of the world.
He shall be the wisest of men, and in those future days... when he will be full of knowledge, science and dignity... he will be the shining example for the youths of Bagdad... and they may remember how the little thief became the dignifi -
Hey!
Where are you going?
You've got what you wanted.
Now, I'm going to find what I want.
What's that?
Some fun.
An adventure at last!
The resulting action, known now by all the world has marked Sunday, September the 3rd, 1939 as a date to be long remembered.
At 11:15 this morning, the prime minister, speaking to the nation from number 10, Downing Street, announced that Great Britain is at war with Germany.
Meanwhile, the London public are earnestly reminded of the emergency orders already issued.
No light of any description should be visible after blackout time.
No dogs or cats will be allowed to roam the streets after dark and it should be remembered that pets will not be permitted in public air-raid shelters.
Gas masks and warm clothing should be placed at hand before retiring and it is suggested that a warm drink in a thermos would be of great comfort to small children who might have to be awakened at an unusual hour.
Every effort should be made to quiet the nerves of those children who still remain in London despite the evacuation, which will continue until a late hour this evening.
Colonel Cronin's car!
I was right, Thomas. It's tonight.
To France, sir?
Waterloo Station.
Yes, sir.
Be familiar to you, won't it, sir? I mean, having been through the last one.
Yes, it'll be familiar.
Thomas?
Sir?
Go by way of Waterloo Bridge, will you?
Waterloo Bridge, sir?
We have plenty of time.
Right, sir.
Wait for me at the other end of the bridge. I'll walk across.
Right, sir.
Here.
Take this.
Your good-luck charm?
Perhaps it'll bring you luck. I hope it will.
I pray it will.
That's wonderfully kind of you. Mm.
Do you think you'll remember me now?
I think so.
I think so.
For the rest of my life.
It was a siren. I heard it distinctly.
Oh, you heard screaming.
I didn't hear a thing.
Well, I did, didn't you-- - Stop it!
There it is again.
Be quiet, please, all of you.
Pardon me, but was that an air-raid warning?
I'm afraid there was. We'll know in a minute.
An air raid. I told you we will be late. - And madame will be furious!
We should worry about madame!
Look! Look!
Air raid!
Please, where can we go?
The underground station on your right.
Come on, girls!
To your right! To your right! To your right!
Stupid bag! It always does this.
Thank you so much.
Imagine they're out to strafe this bridge. We'd better get off it.
Oh, my lucky charm.
You little fool!
Are you tired of life?
I've had it for years. It brings me luck.
Such as air raids?
Do you think it'd be too unmilitary if--if we were to run?
Not at all.
Do you mind?
News weekly. Read about it. Read about it.
All about the war! Paper.
Here, no pushing," he says.
And I says, "You'd blooming well push, you would, if your hind legs were still outside! ™
I always run about myself, as me old man says,
A moving target is harder to hit,"" ain't it?
Not half.
Blimey! Herman's a ruddy marksman, ain't he?
Herman?
Yes, Herman the German.
Oh, oh, I'm... I'm sorry.
There seems to be a certain amount of shoving.
It is a crush, isn't it?
That one was close.
Uh, we're safe here.
There may be some space over there by the wall. - Shall we wriggle through?
All right.
Excuse us, please.
All right.
Better, eh?
Yes, thanks. Much better.
Looking for your friends?
Yes. Perhaps they took another entrance.
Do you mind?
Oh, no, no.
I suppose I mustn't offer you one.
Uh, no, thanks.
You're at school, aren't you?
Am I being funny?
Oh, look. That's our school.
Madame Kirowa's International Ballet.
International ballet?
Mm-hmm.
Look here, you don't mean to say you're a dancer?
Yes.
A professional dancer?
Uh, now and then I wonder.
And you mean you can pirouette and all that sort of thing?
Certainly. I can do an entrechat six.
I beg your pardon?
I can cross my feet six times in midair.
Nijinsky could do ten, but that only happens once in a century.
Well, it must be good for the muscles of the...
Must be good for the muscles.
I should think a dancer's muscles"d be like a strongman.
Oh, not quite. That'd be dreadful.
We try to combine slenderness with strength.
Well, I've been dancing since I was 12 and... and I don't think the muscles are overdeveloped.
Oh, no, no.
Not in your case.
Of course, we have to train like athletes.
Madame believes in rigid discipline.
You expect to get to the theater tonight?
Certainly. We don't go on till 10.
Well, I wish I could be there.
Why don't you come?
No, unfortunately, I have a colonel's dinner. It takes a lot of nerve to miss a colonel's dinner.
Are you home on leave?
I have been. - My home's in Scotland.
And now you have to go back? - To--to France, I mean.
Tomorrow.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
This hateful war.
Yes, I suppose it is.
And yet there's, I don't know, a certain amount of excitement about it, too.
Around the corner of every second, the fascination of the unknown.
We're both facing it this instant.
Oh, we face the unknown in peacetime, too.
You're rather matter-of-fact, aren't you?
Yes.
You're rather romantic, aren't you?
All clear!
All clear!
Well, there we are. I'm afraid it's over. Never enjoyed an air raid more.
Shall we go now or wait for the next?
Oh, it's very tempting, but I think we better go.
Shall I carry that?
No, no. Ll only drop it in emergencies.
Oh, I hope I'm around the next time it happens.
It isn't very likely, is it?
You go back to France and--
And you?
We may go to America.
Oh, that does make it unlikely.
I'm sorry.
Soamll.
Read all about it! Warship sank! Read all about it.
It's so late. I'm afraid I'll have to take a taxi.
That may not be so simple.
I wish I could have seen the--
I don't know any--
What were you going to say?
I wish I could've seen the ballet.
Sure it would have been a pleasant memory in the trenches.
What were you going to say?
Oh, it's just that I... I don't know anyone at the front and
I'm afraid it'll bring it home to me now, knowing you. Not that I really know you, of course.
Here you are, governor!
Thank you very much.
I hope you get back safe and sound.
Thank you.
Here.
Take this.
Your... your good-luck charm?
Perhaps it'll bring you luck. - 1 hope it does.
Oh, now look here. I-I can"t take it. It means so much to you.
You'd better have it, I was beginning to rely on it too much.
Well, that's wonderfully kind of you.
Olympic Theater, please.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Kitty, he's here.
Who? Oh, the man in the underground?
I don't understand. He said he couldn"t come.
Suppose he just came to see the show.
You don't suppose anything of the kind.
Thought you said he had to go to a colonel's dinner.
It's not what I said.
It"s what he said.
He's nice, isn't he?
Hey, he's a bit of all right. Must've ditched the colonel.
You don't think he'll come backstage, do you?
What'll madame say?
We must watch and pray.
Oh, girls! Girls! Girls!
Please! Please, do be quiet.
You know how madame hates noise.
Maureen.
What is pas de bourree?
A pas de bourree is a progression on points by a sequence of very small, even steps.
If you know it, why don't you do it during the performance?
Elsa.
Your arabesques were jumpy.
They were positively epileptic.
Really, I was concerned for you.
Anna.
Show the young ladies, please, how to do an entrechat quatre.
And may I ask why didn"t you do it that way for the audience?
They also have some rights, you know?
The performance tonight was disgraceful.
We are playing for the moment in a variety theater, but--
Kitty.
But that doesn't mean you should work with less precision than performing seals, which precede you.
You don"t honor the ballet by your presence in it.
The ballet honors you.
Are there questions?
Yes, madame?
The note, Kitty.
The note that was handed to you.
Oh, well, I-it's just from an old friend, a--a man I used to know in a show.
I don't need to be reminded that you were a chorus girl in a revue.
Your behavior--
Madame.
Myra.
No, Kitty.
It--it's for me, madame.
Then you may read it.
Aloud, please.
Madame, I--
Read it, please.
As you see, I cannot bear to spend my last evening with my colonel after all.
Please have supper with me. Your friend at the shelter.
1 a.m. sure you will because I have a good-luck charm which has already changed my luck."
And the signature?
There isn't one.
And if there were one, what would it be?
I don't know. I only know he's an officer, madame.
Indeed.
I must emphasize that if you want supper parties, officers, and delights, you shouldn't be here with me but in other occupation.
Lydia, paper, please.
A war is no excuse for indecorum.
Write, please.
Dear sir.
What's his rank?
Captain.
Dear Captain...
Here you are, sir.
Oh, thank you.
Thank you, sir.
No go, sir?
No, I'm afraid not.
Oh, Captain!
Captain!
Wait a minute.
I'm Kitty, Myra's friend. Where do you want to meet her?
What?
Myra?
Oh, how do you do?
I do very well, thank you.
But where do you want to meet her?
L... But she, uh, she refused.
Oh, take no notice. The old dragon made her write that.
You mean, she'll come, after all?
Name the place.
Yes. Does she know the Candlelight Club?
No, but I do.
Good, then I'll, uh, - I'll be there in an hour, say?
An hour.
Look here, I... I hope I'm doing the right thing.
Myra is just a sweet child. You can see that, can't you?
I can see that, Kitty.
Bye-bye, Captain.
Hello.
Oh, hello.
I'm delighted. I was afraid Kitty had directed you to the wrong place.
Oh, no, but your note was read out before the whole class.
Were you embarrassed?
Yes, and so would you have been.
I dare say.
I'm afraid I've made it difficult for you.
Well, you... you gave up the colonel, so I expect I made it difficult for you, too.
Yes, you did, but I have my reward. It was wonderful of you to have come.
Shall we go in?
All right.
Excuse me.
How nice you look!
Thank you.
What do dancers eat?
Oh, dull things, mostly.
Nutritious, yet not fattening.
Oh, no. Not tonight.
What could you suggest that would be particularly rich and indigestible?
The grouse is very nice, sir.
And wine.
It isn't against the rules for a dancer to drink a little light wine, is it?
Well, tonight--
Good. - Number 40, please.
Number 40, sir.
Ah, the ballet was beautiful.
Madame didn't think so.
Well, experts never know. It takes outsiders to know, and I tell you it was beautiful.
That certainly proves you're an outsider.
Are you glad to see me again?
Yes.
I sense a reservation.
Well, I suppose there is one.
What? Why?
What's the good of it?
You're a strange girl, aren't you?
What's the good of anything? What's the good of living?
That's a question, too.
Oh, now, wait a minute. I'm not gonna let you get away with that.
The wonderful thing about living is that this sort of thing can happen.
In the shadow of a death raid, I can meet you and feel more intensely alive than walking around in peacetime taking my life for granted.
Well, it's a high price to pay for it.
I don't think so.
I do. Do people have to kill each other to give them a heightened sense of life?
That's got nothing to do with people killing each other.
Either you're excited about life or you're not.
You know, I've never been able to wait for the future.
When I was very young, a child, in fact,
I climbed to the top branch of a high tree, stood like a diver and announced to my horrified governess,
Now I shall take a leap into the future," and jumped.
I was in the hospital for two months.
You should let the future catch up with you more slowly.
Oh, no, no. Never. Temperament.
Look here, if we'd met in ordinary times, in an ordinary way, we'd just about be telling each other what schools we went to.
We're much further along, don't you think?
Are we?
You know we are.
Now I'm too excited to eat. Let's dance.
All right.
To you.
Thank you.
To us.
Still don't get it, not quite.
What?
Your face. It's all youth, all beauty.
What is it you still don"t get?
You know, when I left you this afternoon, I couldn't remember what you looked like, not for the life of me.
I thought, "Was she pretty? Was she ugly?
What was she like?" I couldn't remember.
I simply had to get to that theater tonight to see what you looked like.
And do you think you'll remember me now?
I think so.
I think so.
For the rest of my life.
But what is it about me you still don't get?
Ladies and gentlemen, we how come to the last dance of the evening.
I hope you'll enjoy "The Farewell Waltz."
I'll tell you later. Let's dance now.
What does it mean, these candles?
You'll find out.
J Should old acquaintance be forgot J
J And never brought to mind? J
J Should old acquaintance be forgot J
J And days of auld lang syne? J
J For auld lang syne, my dear J
J For auld lang syne J
J We'll take a cup of kindness yet
J For auld lang syne J
I'll write to you.
Will you answer?
Of course.
Wonderful evening, wasn't it?
Yes. Thank you very much.
When I come back, we'll... we'll go there again.
Yes.
That'll be our place. That's where we'll always recapture this evening.
Do you think we'll ever see each other again?
I think it's doubtful, don't you?
Yes, I suppose it is.
What was it you started to tell me in the restaurant that you didn't understand about me?
No use going into it now.
No, but tell me. Please, I'd like to know.
Well, it... it struck me as curious ever since I met you, you know, from that very early moment ages ago, that you're so young, so lovely and so defeatist.
I mean, you... you don't seem to expect much from life.
Well, aren't I right?
For instance, I met you, I liked you, and now so soon we have to part and perhaps we'll never see each other again.
You can conceive that then, our never seeing each other again?
Yes, I can.
This where you live?
Yes.
Well, nothing to do about it, is there?
Nothing, uh, except to say goodbye.
I suppose so.
Goodbye.
Goodbye, Myra dear.
Goodbye, Roy.
Keep well.
Yes, you, too. Keep well.
Nothing can happen to me.
Your lucky charm will see to that.
I hope it will. I pray it will.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Please leave me first.
All right.
I shall have to get this catch mended.
Well, I've been telling you.
Broke open twice yesterday.
Oh, Kitty, what time is it?
It's, uh, half past 11.
Good morning, madame.
Good morning.
I came to congratulate you, Myra.
On what, madame?
On being up.
Considering that you didn't go to bed until four, it's remarkable.
I have the feeling your performance tonight will give the effect of sleepwalking.
Well, it's the first time Myra's been out, madame.
When I made you send the note to the military gentleman last night, it was you I was trying to protect.
I'm fond of the girls who work for me.
I don't want them to be camp followers!
You don't know him, or you wouldn't say that.
Can't we have any private lives at all?
Not when it hurts your public life at the theatre.
I'm happy that he didn't stay here a week.
Otherwise he would have ruined six performances instead of one.
If such a thing should happen again, with you or any of the others, it means instant dismissal.
I will see you at the theater tonight, if it's not too much trouble.
Oh, why is she so cruel and hateful?
Ah, the old broomstick. She talks to us all like that.
Never mind.
She spoils everything.
Oh, rubbish!
You're upset and tired.
Why don't you go back to bed? There's no rehearsal today.
No, I'm not tired.
Horrible morning for the channel crossing.
I suppose he's gone now.
Yeah. Suppose so.
Kitty! Kitty, look!
He's here! Look!
Good heavens! - He's deserted!
Kitty, he's here. He hasn't gone! He's here!
He'll be court-martialed for this.
Oh! I've got to go! I've got to go!
Oh, now, calm down, will you, Myra? Oh, y-you see him, too, don't you?
Well, if that's his ghost, don't bring him up.
Oh, get away from that window, you stupid thing. He'll see you, for heaven's sake.
Come on, help me. Where's my hat? Why wasn't I dressed?
Oh. Oh, Kitty, Kitty, come here.
Oh, Kitty, what if I... What'll he, uh--do you suppose--oh, dear!
Oh, Kitty, what do you think-- oh, God, Kitty.
There. Do I look all right?
Yes, you look all right. You'd look better with a dress on.
Oh, yes!
Come on now.
Myra, stop it. - Oh!
I don't know what I'm doing. I must see him.
Oh, dear! These stupid buttons!
Oh, Kitty, Kitty, I just want to-- I just want to...
Oh, Kitty, he came back!
I was beginning to think... But he didn't. He came back.
Is he still there?
He is! He is!
Hey, wait a minute! Wait a minute!
I'll get you a mackintosh. Your umbrella's in the corner there.
Here, put this on.
Now, I'm going to go first.
You don't want to run into madame on the way down.
Wait a minute.
All clear.
And please tell him no more false alarms. I can"t stand the excitement.
Hello.
Hello.
Nice of you to come and see me.
Not at all.
You--you didn't go?
Couldn't. Mines in the channel, 48 hours leave.
Oh, isn't that wonderful?
Yes.
I have two whole days.
You know, I-- thought about you all last night. Couldn"t sleep a wink.
You managed to remember me at last then?
Yes, barely managed.
Myra, what do you think we're going to do today?
Well, I- -I--
Oh, you won't have time for that.
For what?
For hesitating. No more hesitating for you.
No?
Well, what am I going to do instead?
You're going to get married.
Roy, you must be mad!
I know it! Marvelous sensation!
Oh, Roy, do be sensible.
But you don't know me.
Then I'll discover you. Spend the rest of my life doing it.
Oh, Roy, this is wartime.
It's-- it's because you're leaving so soon, because you feel you must spend the whole of your life in 48 hours.
We're going to be married.
It's you. It'll never be anyone else.
But how can you tell that?
Now, listen, darling, none of your quibbling.
None of your questioning, none of your doubts. This is positive, you see?
This is affirmative, you see? This is final, you see?
You're going to marry me, you see?
I see.
What's the matter, darling?
Where are we going?
To announce our engagement.
To the barracks, Armor Square.
Now, Myra, I wanna give you a complete picture - of what I'm going to let you in for.
All right.
I have to acquaint you with certain facts.
All right.
In the first place, my dear young lady, I am a captain in the Rendleshire Fusiliers.
Are you impressed?
Very much.
A captain in the Rendleshire Fusiliers cannot marry casually.
It requires immense preparation, formality, etiquette.
I see.
It's an elaborate ritual.
Is it? - M-hmm.
For example, a captain in the Rendleshire Fusiliers has before he marries, to get the consent of his colonel.
Is that difficult?
Well, it might or it might not be.
I feel it's going to be difficult.
Mm-mm, great deal depends upon the petitioner, on the charm of the petitioner, on his ardor, on his eloquence.
Myra, look at me!
Yes, Captain?
Can you doubt the outcome?
You are very conceited, Captain. You are quite mad, Captain.
You are reckless and headstrong and... and I adore you, Captain.
Now sit here. And don"t speak to strangers. I'll be right back.
Myra!
So soon?
No, I haven't seen him yet.
I forgot something very important. - In fact, indispensable.
What?
Your vital statistics.
Oh, I'm afraid I mislaid them.
I'll dig 'em up.
Now then, I assume you were you born. - Where?
Birmingham.
When?
Uh, June 9th, 1895.
Father's profession?
Schoolmaster.
Parents living?
No.
Now let's see, what else?
Oh, yes!
What's your last name?
Oh, Roy! Lester.
It's lucky I thought of that. That's very vital.
Goodbye, Ms. Lester.
Goodbye.
Wait just a second.
Excuse me, sir.
Yes, yes? What is it, Cronin?
May I see you privately, sir?
I am at lunch!
Oh, it's extremely important, sir.
You held us up last night waiting for you at dinner, now you interrupt my lunch.
It's all part of the same thing, sir.
Very well. Back in a minute.
I'm terribly sorry, sir, but I think you'll understand. I ho--
Do you mind giving me some sort of a clue?
Oh, I'm sorry about not turning up for your dinner last night, sir, but, uh, you see, Colonel...
Well, whatever it is, I hope you straighten it out before I get chronic indigestion.
Sit down.
Oh, I-I'd rather stand if you don't mind, sir. The fact is, Colonel... fact... the fact... I'm in a frightful hurry.
What is the fact?
Well, with your permission, sir, if you don't mind, sir, I'd like to get married this afternoon.
And who is the-bride-to-be, may I ask?
Her name is Myra Lester. I have her vital statistics.
Oh.
Sit down.
You known her long?
Long enough to be absolutely sure, sir.
Has she been presented at court?
I believe not, sir.
But she is eligible for presentation, I presume?
Cronin, you're leaving for the front tomorrow. Are you sure that hasn't a good deal to do with your haste?
Certainly, sir, you see, I wanna marry her before I leave so that she can go and stay with my mother until I get back.
I see.
Well, Cronin, this...
This is a good deal of responsibility.
I know, sir.
And a responsibility that I cannot assume by myself.
1, uh, I wish you'd try, sir.
Sorry. But I'm afraid I'll have to ask you to get the consent of His Grace, the colonel-in-chief.
I see.
As he is your relative, he can enquire more closely into this than I can.
However, if you get his consent, you have mine.
Thank you, sir.
And I hope your future engagements will not take place during mealtimes!
I'll try, sir.
Good luck.
Thank you, sir.
Revelstoke House, Belrose Square.
Yes, sir.
Captain Cronin, Your Grace.
Ah, my boy. I'm glad to see you.
Thank you, sir.
Very glad, indeed. - How are you?
Very well, sir.
When do you go back?
Day after tomorrow. Hm.
You'll be getting back for that push at Cambrai, I expect.
1 hope so, sir.
Sit down.
Thank you.
Had a nice leave?
Wonderful.
Good! Good. You deserve it.
Well, my boy, is there anything I can do for you?
Yes, sir.
What is it?
Well, I... I'd like your consent, sir, to my marriage.
Your marriage!
Uh, who's the girl?
Ms. Myra Lester.
Lester. Lester.
Surrey?
No. Birmingham.
Birmingham, eh?
Lester.
Do I know them?
No, but I can remedy that, sir.
Does your mother know her?
No, but she will. At least Myra.
Her parents are dead, sir. She's all alone.
Dear, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear.
Well, what does she do?
She's a dancer.
A dancer?
Yes, sir.
She's, uh, - she's terribly nice, sir.
A dancer.
You know, Roy...
Oh, you know, Roy...
I like dancers.
Well, thank you, sir.
I-l mean, I--l don't blame you.
Naturally. In my time, you understand. - In my time.
Of course, sir.
When I was your age, I was in love with a dancer.
I wanted to marry her.
But she wouldn't.
Ha, if she'd accepted me, she'd have been your aunt.
That would have been delightful.
Look here, my boy, I don't mind telling you
I'm very proud of your war record.
Oh, thank you, sir.
Now, you know what you're doing, I suppose?
Yes, sir.
You'll be proud of her, too, sir. I'm sure.
I don't necessarily believe in what they call correct marriages.
Seen too many of them turn out badly.
Well, good luck, my boy, and bless you.
Thank you, sir.
I'll never forget this, neither will she.
That's all right.
Bring her 'round to see me on your next leave.
I shall.
Fine fellow.
Thank you again, sir.
A dancer, eh?
Well, Ms. Lester, I have the honor to announce that His Grace has consented to the marriage of Captain Roy Cronin of the Rendleshire Fusiliers to Ms. Myra Lester of Birmingham, Warwickshire, England.
No family opposition?
Not a speck.
Disappointed?
Oh, it's too easy, I'm frightened.
Defeatist!
Where to, sir?
Uh, to Bond Street.
Yes, sir.
Bond Street?
Bond Street for a ring.
Very simple ring. I don't wanna spoil you straight off.
Then to the florist. You deserve a posy. - Then to St. Matthew's Church.
St. Matthew's? Really?
Of course, St. Matthew's.
They have the proper tradition. Swift regimental marriages.
We walk in comparative strangers, we walk out comparative friends.
The door beyond leads to the church, sir. You'll find the vicar at choir practice.
Thank you.
Well, darling?
Oh, Roy.
Shall we face it?
It's been so quick.
Are you quite, quite sure?
Myra, I was never so sure of anything in my life.
And the moment you left me after the air raid, I knew I must find you again, quickly.
I've found you and I'll never let you go.
Does that answer you?
Wait here a moment.
This is Ms. Lester.
How do you do, Ms. Lester?
How do you do?
I'm sorry to disappoint you, Ms. Lester, but I'm afraid it's impossible for me to marry you now.
No doubt you forget that according to the law, no marriages can take place after three o'clock.
I explained to the vicar, Myra, that, uh, this is an emergency that we thought during wartime something could be managed.
Isn't there anything you can do, sir?
I mean, - be most awfully grateful.
Oh, I'd like to help you.
But unfortunately, that is the law.
However, if you'll come tomorrow morning at 11 o'clock, I shall be most happy to perform the ceremony for you.
But we have so little time.
Well, it's... it's only a few hours. It just means that we'll have to be engaged for a whole day.
I don't believe in long engagements. Do you, vicar?
Oh, not when the parties are elderly.
But I think in your case it can do no harm.
Then I shall expect you tomorrow at 11?
We'll be here.
Eleven precisely. - On the stroke of the hour.
I shall be punctual.
Goodbye. And thank you very much.
Goodbye, Ms. Lester.
Goodbye, sir.
Goodbye.
Where is Myra, anyhow? It's almost eight.
We've gotta go to the theater.
I tell you, I just tremble for the poor girl.
Oh, you're always trembling.
Maybe she went directly to the theater.
That's right. She's probably waiting for us there.
I hope so.
Well, where have you been?
I've been worried to death.
I thought you were with the boyfriend, but he phoned a couple of times.
Oh, did he?
I wonder why.
He had to go back to the barracks, and I went shopping.
Hey, what's happened to you?
Who--whose dress is that?
It's mine.
Yours?
Yes. I spent my last penny on it.
Are you crazy?
Yes, quite, quite.
And I bought a hat, lovely hat, and shoes and bag and then gloves and--
Oh, isn't it a dream, Kitty? It's--
It's my wedding dress.
Wha--
Oh, Myra, you... you don't mean that?
Yes. I'm going to be married.
Oh, darling, come here, let me hug you! - Oh!
Oh, it's wonderful!
What? When? When?
How? Tomorrow morning at St. Matthews church. Oh, Kitty, I'm so madly happy.
Oh, darling, I can't believe it!
Neither can I.
This is silly. I'm crying.
I've been crying all day.
Oh, it's--it's unbelievable!
Things like this just don't happen. It's--it's so wonderful!
Oh, what a joke on madame!
Kitty, are you coming?
Yeah, yes, all right. Wait a second.
Uh, y-you're coming to the theater, aren't you?
Of course. I wouldn't let madame down for anything.
Then we'd better hurry. Come along.
Oh, girls!
Girls! Hey, Lydia! Girls!
Girls, what do you think?
Myra's going to be married.
Married?
May I tell "em? You don"t mind, do you?
Darling, you seem to have done it.
When?
Tomorrow morning.
What's his name?
Roy Cronin.
Well, Mrs. Cronin, I declare.
I'm so happy for you, Myra.
Oh, Vi, you are a darling. You're all so sweet.
I feel like crying, too.
But we haven't got the time. Come on, girls. We're late for the theater.
Come on, girls!
Ms. Myra, you're wanted on the telephone.
Thank you.
Hello?
Yes?
What?
Oh, no!
When?
Oh, that's terrible.
Can't they give you one more day?
You have to--
Of course, I'll come at once.
I love you.
What is it? What's happened?
The orders have been changed. He's going tonight.
The train leaves in 25 minutes.
Oh. - I'm going to see him off.
Going where?
To Waterloo Station.
But you can't. You won't be back in time for the show. Madame--
I'm sorry.
Myra, please.
She'd never forgive you. Never. Don't do it, Myra.
I may never see him again.
She's just going, sir.
Excuse me.
Myra!
Roy!
Myra!
Roy!
Myra!
Myra, darling.
Did he leave?
Did you talk to him?
Didn't you see him at all?
Just caught a glimpse of him.
Oh, what a shame!
I couldn't get a taxi and they told me the wrong platform.
Oh, he--he'll be back.
He'll be all right, Myra. The war can't last forever.
Good evening, Myra.
It's very condescending of you to come here at all.
She's very unhappy, madame.
Her fiancé was called to the front.
I'm not interested in troop movements.
She was to be married in the morning.
Nor in social events.
Well, the whole world doesn't begin and end with a ballet.
My world does!
And while you're with me, so must yours.
That prescription no longer applies to Myra.
Oh, don't sack her, madame.
I warned you.
You are dismissed.
I never heard of such unrea--
Be careful, Kitty.
No, I won't be careful!
Kitty.
I'm fed up with her.
I've been wanting to tell her for two years and now I'm going to tell you, and if you don't like it you can lump it.
I'm sick of you and your tyranny.
You treat us like a lot of slaves and call it discipline.
It isn't that. It's just that you enjoy bullying us.
Lydia.
Yes, madame?
Rehearsal tomorrow at 11.
With two understudies.
Goodnight.
Well, no more ballet for me.
I'm sick of being highbrow with my feet.
You and I, ducky, are going to get into a revue.
All we've got to do is to get some manager to put one on.
That ought to be simple.
Kitty?
Yes?
Do you think...
Occasionally. What?
Do you think he'll write?
Hello.
I'm back, and I didn't get the job.
Oh, Kitty, you startled me.
Did 1? Sorry.
Well, now that I'm all settled, how about you?
Oh, no luck.
There's nothing there.
Well, I had two letters last week. - 1 didn't really expect any. - Uh-huh?
How about the dress shop?
Experience needed.
And the tearoom?
Filled.
Naturally.
But they put me on the waiting list.
Oh, that's a comfort, isn't it?
Well, Myra, we're a couple of howling successes sitting on top of the world, aren't we?
Well, you're in a nice mood, aren't you?
No wonder, sitting here in the dark feeling sorry for yourself.
Well, if I don"t feel sorry for myself, who will?
Trouble with you is you're hungry. Come on, give me your hand.
You'll feel better when you've had something to eat.
Myra?
Yes, Kitty?
You're probably sick of hearing this but, honestly, why don't you let Roy know?
That we're out of work?
That we're broke.
Flat broke. Down to our last tin.
Oh, he'd worry.
Better for him to worry than for us to starve.
Oh, Kitty, we're not starving.
Nobody starves.
You mean, people who starve don't live to tell about it.
I don't know what we're going to do.
We can't get jobs in a show, we can't get "em anywhere else.
If madame were still here I'd go to her, pride or no pride.
But as it is, there's nobody.
Myra...
I'm frightened.
I've never been frightened before.
I don't like it.
Oh, Kitty.
Perhaps it's selfish of me not to let Roy know but I've got a stupid sort of pride about it.
Can't we wait a little while? Just little while longer.
Something must turn up.
And if doesn't, well...
Oh, it's Mrs. Bassett, for the rent.
Remember. You're rehearsing.
Oh, yes.
Miss Lester?
Uh, I'm Miss Lester.
For you, Miss Lester.
Well, thank you.
Quite all right, miss.
Kitty!
Flowers.
I can't imagine--
Here, let's see. Put them down here.
Oh, gosh...
Oh! Aren't they lovely? - Oh!
Kitty, it's Roy! It's his handwriting!
Fifteen, eighteen, twe-- twenty-four.
They must have cost a pound at least!
Oh. Enough to buy us food for a whole week.
One of my men got leave and you'll be receiving these through him.
And with them, I send you all my..."
We, uh, we could sell them to the florist at the corner and buy ourselves a real meal.
But I don't think you'd favor the idea?
No.
Oh, Kitty!
His mother's coming here!
To London?
Yes, yes. Listen. "My mother is snatching a few days from her Red Cross work and is coming to town especially to see you.
I know you'll get on well with her. She's very nice.
In fact, she's quite like me."
Oh, Kitty.
What'll I do? I can't have her here!
Let's give her a little party, and open up the last tin.
I'll suggest meeting her somewhere. For tea, perhaps.
Oh, but, Kitty, imagine, his mother!
I'm awfully nervous at meeting her. I wonder...
What, you funny love-struck infant?
I wonder if she'll like me.
Well, she better, or we won't invite her at all.
Myra, you're trembling.
Oh, Kitty, don"t you see that meeting her will be like seeing Roy again?
You've been such a darling to me.
Now perhaps I'll be able to repay you.
You know, I have a feeling that from now on, everything's going to take a turn for the better.
I'm sure it is.
One?
No, there'll be another one later.
Is there a table by the window?
I think so.
Oh, no, thank you. I'll wait for my friend.
She's Lady Margaret Cronin, and I'm Miss Lester.
If she should ask for me, will you direct her to me here?
Certainly.
What time is it, please?
It's ten minutes to five, miss.
Thank you.
Your friend seems to be held up.
Yes.
Sure you wouldn't like a cup of tea while you're waiting, miss?
Oh, no, thank you. I'm sure she'll be here any minute.
Would you care to look at the evening paper?
Oh, thank you.
Feeling better, miss?
Here. Take another sip.
Feel faint, don't you?
Well, you did give us a fright.
Wouldn't you like to go to the rest room and lie down a bit?
No, I...
I'd rather stay here, if you don't mind.
Better take another drop of this then.
Better?
Sure?
Yes. I'll be all right.
And if your friend doesn't turn up, we'll call a taxi.
Are you Miss Lester?
Yes.
I'm Margaret Cronin, Roy's mother.
I'm afraid I've kept you waiting. Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
My train was half an hour late.
You know how it is these days, but I've come straight from Scotland to keep this appointment, so I do hope you'll forgive me.
What shall we have? Tea? Little cakes?
No, no, thank you. I don't think so...
I can't stay very long.
Tea for one then, and some thin toast.
I do hope you're not going to run off at once.
I've wanted so much to meet you, but I've been so terribly busy.
You know, I've been turning an old country place into a rest home for wounded men.
By the way, I telephoned you from Scotland, to the hotel where Roy told me you were staying.
And then I tried to get in touch with you through the ballet, but they said it'd gone to America.
I was about to wire Roy when your note came.
I have my mail forwarded.
There... there are reasons.
Oh, my dear.
I didn't mean to pry.
Forgive me, my dear, but you're not afraid of me, are you?
I know it is bit of an ordeal, meeting one's future in-laws.
I remember how I dreaded it.
But I'm not very terrifying, am 1?
I know we're going to be good friends.
I feel that I know you already through Roy's letters.
And I want to write him and tell him that you and I have met and that we like each other very much.
May I write him that?
Yes, yes, of course.
I suppose there are lot of things you want to know about Roy that I could tell you and I'm sure there are things about him that you could tell me.
Why don't they bring your tea? They're very slow.
Shall I call the waitress?
Don't bother, I'm in no hurry.
Would you rather that I didn't speak to you about Roy?
No. No.
Why should you think that?
But... what is there to say?
Forgive me, my dear, but are you quite well?
Yes, yes, of course. I...
I had a drink, that's all. It made me feel funny, queer.
What's it like in Scotland?
I've never been there.
It always sounds so quaint, you know, the heather and the peat.
Peat comes from Ireland, doesn't it?
I've never been there either.
Why do you stare at me like that?
I'm trying to see you as Roy sees you.
Myra, I want you to remember that I tried to be your friend.
I've come because Roy wanted me to come.
And because I wished to.
Perhaps we'll try again someday.
Perhaps on Roy's next leave, he'll bring you to the country.
Goodbye, Myra.
The lady is leaving, miss?
Myra.
Myra!
Who is it?
Has Miss Lester gone out, Mrs. Clark?
What? What is it?
Where's Miss Lester?
How should I know?
She went out.
When?
About hour ago.
You shouldn't have let her. You know, she's not well enough to go out and on a night like this, too.
This is lodging house, Miss Meredith, not a nursing home!
Myra, where have you been?
Whatever made you go out on a night like this?
You went and got caught in the rain too.
Now, you come on upstairs and get into bed.
Why, we spend months building you up and you go and do a silly thing like this.
I can't trust you out of my sight.
Now you get those things off, double quick time, too.
I'll fix you a hot-water bottle.
Kitty?
Yes.
How did the show go tonight?
Oh, same as usual.
Was it a good house?
So-so.
Why?
I went to the theater.
I thought I'd surprise you by calling for you.
Oh, y--
You see, Myra I didn't want to worry you.
See, I'm in a different sort of a show than the one I said I was in, a... cheaper sort of show.
Kitty, you haven't got a job at all. You never did have one.
How have we been living?
What difference does it make as long as we live?
Where's the money coming from? Where are you getting it?
Where do you think I've been getting it?
I tried to keep it from you, but... well, you know now.
You did it for me.
No, I didn't.
I'd have done it anyhow.
C'est la guerre!
No jobs, no boys who want to marry you.
Only men who want to kill a few hours 'cause they know it may be their last.
Kitty, you did it for me, to buy me food and medicine.
I'd sooner have died.
No, no, you wouldn't.
You think you would, but you wouldn't.
I thought of that.
But I wasn't brave enough.
I wanted to go on living. Heaven knows why, but I did and so would you.
We're young and it... it's good to live, even the life I'm leading, though God knows it...
I've heard them call it "the easiest way."
I wonder who ever thought up that little phrase.
I know one thing.
It couldn't have been a woman.
I suppose you think I'm dirt.
Oh, Kitty!
Hello.
Bit of weather we had this evening, didn't we?
It's cleared up though, nicely, after all.
How about a little... stroll?
How's luck?
No such thing.
How's Kitty?
About the same as me.
Nowadays, there don't seem to be no luck for nobody.
Oh, well.
Better days coming, so the song says.
I hope so. Toodle-oo.
Bye-bye.
Hello, Myra.
How's luck?
I'm not exactly prepared to retire yet.
Well, here they come.
Cheerio.
Cheerio.
Welcome home.
Thanks, ducky.
Myra!
Myra!
Myra!
Myra, I can't believe it.
It is you, isn't it?
It's really you.
Oh, Roy!
It's really you.
Oh. Darling, let me look at you.
I'm not dreaming, am 1?
To think of finding you here waiting for me!
Why, it--it's a miracle.
Roy, you're alive!
Oh. The months I've waited for this moment. I began to think it would never come.
How did you know I was coming?
Did you telephone Mother?
Now, darling, nhone of that.
Chin up. Where's your nerve?
It's over, darling, it's all over. We're together for always.
Oh, Roy!
You're alive.
Yes, extravagantly.
Oh, my poor darling.
Come on, we'll go sit down.
Oh, darling, don't cry. It's a happy ending.
Have you missed me?
Did you think I was...
Didn't you know I was indestructible?
How could I die when we're engaged? Did you think I'd break our engagement?
Oh. You don't know me, young woman.
No, I was wounded and somehow lost my identification disc.
It's a long story. I'll tell you someday.
Anyhow, I was in a German prison camp for the better part of a year. Head wound.
Pretty nearly signed off but I got out at last and went to Switzerland.
Mother came over, of course, mines or no mines.
And then I heard that-- that she lost touch with you.
I almost lost my mind.
What happened? D-did she find you?
Did you get in touch with her?
No.
Well, then, you didn't know I was coming?
No.
What were you doing at the station?
Were you looking for a friend?
Yes.
Well, I'm the friend you were looking for.
Who was he? Ll insist upon knowing.
Who was he?
Oh. It was a girl. No one in particular.
It's just a little short of a miracle that I should run smack into you like this when you were waiting for no one in particular.
Ah, here we are. Good strong tea. This will buck you up.
Come on, drink this.
I want to talk to you.
I've got a thousand questions.
What have you been up to?
Have you got a job? Where is it? What does it pay?
Not that it really matters because you're quitting it. You're quitting it this instant.
I'm not going to let you out of my sight this time, not till we're married, you understand that?
Oh, darling, you've been through a lot, haven't you?
It's been...
It's been...
Pretty tough, eh?
And I wasn't there to help you.
But that's all over now.
I'm going to make it up to you. I'm going to make things easy for you.
I never want to see you cry again, except with happiness.
If I'd only known you were alive, that you were in the world.
I'll never leave you again, darling. Never.
And now, Miss Lester, I have a program.
I'm a man with a program. A man of action.
I'm phoning my mother that I found you in record time and that we're coming up on the evening train.
Excuse me while I find a phone. And don"t move until I come back to you.
The fact is, Lady Margaret, - we'll be up on the nine-six.
Roy, I must speak to you. - There's something I must s--
Will you?
That'll be marvelous.
Thanks, Mother.
Goodbye.
Well, that's that.
Roy, you must listen to me.
Myra, what is it?
I can't go to the country with you.
It's... quite out of the question.
Why not?
Please don't ask me. But I... I simply can"t.
But I've got to ask. And you've got to tell me.
Why, I look terrible, for one thing. I haven't any clothes.
And I, well, I really can't go anywhere.
You little fool.
Let me have a squint at you. I think you exaggerate.
Now that I look at you, perhaps there's something in what you say.
Well, Madame Cronin-to-be, we'll see what we can do. How would you like to be the smartest woman in London?
No, Roy! I can"t.
Myra, darling.
I'm afraid I've been stupid.
Conceited and stupid.
Because you've never been out of my thoughts, I...
I took it for granted that it was the same with you.
There's someone else, isn't there, Myra?
After all, you thought me... dead.
There is someone else, isn't there?
Don't be afraid, tell me.
Roy, of course there isn't anyone else.
There couldn't be.
I loved you.
I've never loved anyone else.
I never shall.
That's the truth, Roy.
That's all I wanted to know.
Oh, darling, smile for a change.
Have you forgotten how?
That's a good girl.
I can't believe I'm with you again.
But you are.
Happy?
Yes.
Personally, I'm delirious.
Come on, we're going shopping.
Myra!
Well, what's all this?
Have you taken to shoplifting?
Oh. Kitty darling, Roy's alive! He's back.
Roy?
No! - Yes.
He's back. We've been together the whole afternoon.
He'll be here any minute.
Kitty... he wants to marry me.
Oh, no.
Such things don't happen.
It's true.
Oh, Kitty, it's going to be so wonderful.
For you too. Nothing will be too good for you when I'm Roy's wife.
Oh. I know what you're thinking.
I've been thinking, too.
You think that would be dreadful of me, don't you?
Does he know?
No.
Do you think you can get away with it?
You mean deceiving him?
Yes.
Oh. I'm going to tell him.
There are two sorts of people, Myra, those who get the breaks, and those who don't.
Well, I'm getting the breaks now and I'm not going to sink.
You remember you once said that you wanted to live?
Well, I want to live.
This is my chance for life. And I won't let him go.
He's so kind, Kitty, so sweet and clean and wonderful.
I'll devote myself to him.
After all, it's his happiness, too, Kitty.
He... he loves me. He's waited for me.
And in my soul, I've waited for him.
Tell me I can go to him. Please, Kitty.
Guess there are no rules, Myra, for what you feel and what he feels.
Kitty.
After all, if he's mad enough about you, it may make up for everything.
It must! It must!
Well, try it.
Go to him.
Oh, Kitty.
The ancestral acres, Myra.
Shall I point out the things we're proudest of no matter how boring?
Oh, it's beautiful. Simply beautiful.
Mother will take you all over this.
You mustn't tell her I've showed you a thing. See it all for the first time with her. - Be enthusiastic, too.
That won't be difficult.
It must be wonderful to spend one's childhood in a place like this.
Yes, it's great when you're young.
When you're really young.
Oh, Roy.
Do you think of yourself as old?
No one who has been in this war is young.
No, that's true.
Do you remember Longfellow's line,
The thoughts of youth are long, long thoughts?"
Myra.
Yes, Roy.
We're awfully good together, don"t you think?
RSVP.
I mean, that was a question. It requires an answer. Yes or no?
Yes.
Your answer is correct.
Our home, darling.
Mother!
Myra!
I'm so glad to see you again, my dear.
Isn't it wonderful, Roy finding you so quickly?
I really believe there's providence in it.
I'm sure of it, Mother.
You're very kind, Lady Margaret..
Roy, I do hope you haven't shown Myra anything.
I want to show her around myself.
I didn't show her a thing.
Good.
Come.
Oh, I'm so happy.
Hello, Barnes! - Oh.
Mr. Roy, do excuse me.
I've been waiting all afternoon for the dogcart and then I missed it.
Just at the crucial moment, as you might say.
Well, as a matter of fact, Barnes, I missed my welcoming committee. Wanted to impress Miss Lester.
However, this is my future wife, Barnes.
Myra, this is Barnes.
How do you do?
How do you do?
Brought me up from a baby. He'll tell you all about it in detail if you let him.
Oh, I'd love to hear about it.
Well, he gave us an awful lot of trouble, Miss Lester.
He wasn't what you would call a good child, but you couldn't resist him.
One day, he jumped from a treetop--
I've told her about that, Barnes. - You fish up something new.
Yes, sir.
Come, Mother, what about showing Myra to her room?
Oh, Roy, I forgot.
I'm afraid we're going to be invaded.
Invaded?
The neighbors.
I did my best to spare you but the whole countryside is coming in tonight to see you and your bride.
Poor Myra. She's going to see some wonderful types.
They do look well together, don't they?
She's a lovely girl. Perfectly lovely.
I suppose very soon these two young people will be paying me a professional visit.
Tomorrow morning, I expect.
Roy's madly in love.
Jealous?
A little.
But you like her, don't you?
Very much.
More every minute.
She dances beautifully, doesn't she?
Well, that's her job.
Those Cronin men, they're always attracted by girls who undress in public.
Why don"t you try it, Violet?
I haven't the nerve.
I'm not quite sure that I've got the figure.
All I can say is that there are plenty of charming girls of good family in the county who would have jumped at Roy.
And I don't mean my niece, Victoria.
I wonder if she can ride.
Who's ever heard of her?
Has anyone ever seen her dance?
Well, evidently, Roy's seen her and, evidently, liked it.
You'll notice the duke isn't here.
Evidently, the duke doesn't like it.
Happy?
Yes.
Completely?
Yes.
Ecstatically?
Yes.
No doubts?
No reservations?
No.
No defeatism?
No.
Darling, every once in a while, I see fear in your eyes.
Why?
Oh, life's been hard for you. I know that.
You've had to struggle and endure privation but that's all over now.
You're safe now.
Don't be afraid.
You needn't be, ever again.
I love you.
Oh. Roy, you're so good. You're so--
Oh, darling, it's... it's unreal, isn't it?
Yes.
Shall we wake up suddenly and find it untrue?
Roy, don't be defeatist.
Rather like running the gauntlet, wasn't it, to dance in there?
Oh, but you're a great success, darling.
Everyone's enchanted with you.
But they haven't met me yet.
You warm?
Yes, very.
Would you like a cooling drink?
Oh, I'd love one.
I'll get you some of Barnes"s famous punch.
Cool and innocent and deceptive.
You sit right here. Don't move an eyelid till I come back.
I'll run off with the first strolling minstrel.
Darling!
Darling.
Of course I'm here. I've come to see that young woman.
Where is she? Where are you hiding her?
This is Myra.
Myra, this is my uncle, the source of those bellows you just heard.
How do you do?
So this is Myra, is it?
I'm very glad you came.
Why have you kept us apart?
Now my troubles begin.
Roy, you told me you were going to get Myra some punch.
What about it?
I knew it was too good to last.
Come, my dear. Let's sit down.
Do you know, you gave me 10 of the most anxious moments of my life?
Did I?
When?
When I was waiting in the cab while Roy was inside asking your permission to marry me.
Were you outside in the cab?
Why didn't he bring you in?
I don't suppose he dared.
Quite right.
Very shrewd of him.
If he had, I'd never have given my consent.
I should have asked for you myself.
And I'd have said yes.
My dear, will you do me a favor?
Oh, I'd love to.
Will you do me the honor to dance with me?
Of course, but I'm afraid Roy will think we've eloped.
Well, maybe we will.
All right.
Come along. I haven't been here for ages.
Come on, my dear. Let's make an entrance.
You dance beautifully, my dear. And why not, indeed?
So do you.
1? Oh, no.
Oh, dear! Oh, dear!
Well, that dance is the climax of my career.
I can now retire permanently and write my memoirs.
You're awfully kind. I shall always be grateful to you.
Grateful? Grateful? What are you talking about?
Do you think I don't why you came here tonight and made a point of dancing with me in front of all those people?
Point? Point? What point?
You wanted to show them that you approved of me.
Because you knew if you approved, they would.
Incidentally, I jolly well liked it.
You're awfully nice.
I do so want them to like me
I--l want to be a success because of Roy.
Well, you know what these people are.
They're good people, mind you, kind people, but they're old-fashioned and rather limited in their social ideas.
What's good enough for Alfred the Great's good enough for me," sort of thing.
You see that emblem?
Mm-hm.
Broken lance, our regimental badge.
Roy's regiment, too.
Well, they think the only way to keep up the tradition is to lead a dull life and marry one of themselves.
They think of a dancer, someone a little racy, shall I say, to put it mildly.
Too bad you can't live up to their idea, Myra, isn't it? Ha.
It'd be good fun, wouldn't it?
Yes, it would.
But Roy"s instinct tells him what you are.
My instinct tells me, too.
You're sound and good.
That badge is never going to suffer at your hands.
If I weren't sure of that,
I wouldn't welcome you as I do now.
Myra!
Well, Uncle, I think I've been more than generous, leaving you so long with Myra.
Longer would be foolhardy.
Yes, Roy, you'd better take her away before she discovers that I'm the better man.
Listen, Myra.
I had them play it. Let's dance to it.
Will you excuse us, sir?
Thank you.
For what? For what? Go and enjoy yourselves.
Remember, darling? The Candlelight Club?
It's forever ago, isn't it?
And yet, it's tonight.
Come in.
Do I disturb you?
Oh, no.
Please come in, Lady Margaret.
I knocked very gently, SO as in case you were asleep, I shouldn't wake you.
Won't you sit down?
I thought you'd be awake.
I said, she's far too happy and excited to be asleep.
Two things keep one up. Great happiness, or great misery.
Don't you think so?
Yes.
I couldn't go to sleep either without getting something off my chest, as the Americans say.
Are you sure you're not too tired?
No, no, of course not.
It's about our last meeting in London. That has preyed upon my mind ever since.
Do you bear a grudge against me for that, Myra?
Oh, no, Lady Margaret.
I came with a prejudice.
And when I saw you, you seemed strange to me.
I thought you couldn't be... well, what I wanted Roy's wife to be.
I've no excuse except a mother's excuse for wanting an impossible ideal for her son.
Can you forgive me?
But there's nothing to forgive.
When I got home the next day,
I found the telegram telling me the dreadful news about Roy.
And when I could think again, it suddenly struck me that you had known all the time.
That you'd just seen his name in the paper.
And that you hardly knew what you were saying.
Is that true?
Yes.
Oh, you poor child. If I'd only known.
I did my very best to find you, but you disappeared.
And now I want to make it up to you in the future.
I'm very happy about this marriage, Myra, and I know we're going to be wonderful friends.
Forgive me for being sentimental.
Goodnight, my daughter.
Lady Margaret!
Lady Margaret!
Lady Margaret.
Yes, Myra?
I must speak to you.
Why, of course, Myra.
I can't marry Roy.
Sit down quietly, dear, and tell me.
I must go away.
I should never have come here.
I knew it was impossible, but...
I kept deceiving myself.
I've got to go away. I...
I must never see him again.
My dear, why don't you tell me what it is?
I'm sure I can help you.
No one can help me.
But my dear, what can it be that is so terrible?
Has there been someone else?
Oh, Lady Margaret... you are naive.
Myra!
Yes!
Yes! Yes!
Myra!
That thought which is now in your mind, which you're telling yourself can't be true, is true.
_
Why didn't you tell him?
I didn't have the courage.
Oh, I can give you plenty of reasons.
I was hungry. I was poor. I...
I thought Roy was dead, but...
I could make you understand, but it wouldn't help me.
Oh, I don't know what to say.
But it's my fault as much as yours for not having understood, for not having taken care of you.
Oh, don't be nice to me!
If I... if I leave early in the morning, if I... if I never see Roy again,
will you promise me he'll never know?
I couldn't bear to hurt him like that.
Myra...
Oh, let us wait until the morning. Let us think this over.
Will you promise?
I promise.
Thank you.
You've been so good.
I wish I could have been all that you hoped.
Myra!
Why, you little gadabout. What are you doing prowling around at this hour?
You been with Mother? - Yes.
Isn't she wonderful?
Yes, she is.
I knew I wouldn't sleep so I've been walking in the garden, confiding my good luck to the stars.
Were they pleased?
Oh, they seemed indifferent. They went on glittering, the little exhibitionists.
Oh, ever see this before?
I think so.
Well, here.
But I... I gave it to you. It's yours.
I think it'll be safer with you, just as I'll be.
I dropped it in the garden a moment ago and I was frantic until I found it again.
I think you better have it from now on because, now that we're both, as they say, one, it really doesn't matter which one of us keeps it, does it?
It's brought me luck.
Now let it bring you luck.
I'll keep it for you, Roy.
I'm tired, darling.
Yes. You look tired.
Been a strenuous day for you.
Yes.
Goodnight, darling.
Goodbye, darling.
Why goodbye, when it's only till morning?
Because every parting from you is... is like a little eternity.
That's the way I feel, too.
Goodbye.
Goodbye, little sentimentalist.
Tomorrow... a whole day to ourselves.
Yes, my love.
Wait for me.
Myra!
Myra! It's Roy.
Myra!
What on earth's going--
Oh, it's you.
Hello, Kitty.
Where's Myra?
She's not with you?
What are you talking about?
She left Scotland last night.
Without telling you?
She's not been here then?
Well, not since she walked out of here with you the other day. Look, here.
Can ll come in?
Of course.
I-I was just having a bite to eat.
Sit down.
What's happened?
She left a note that she couldn't marry me.
Was there any trouble, with your family?
No, no, no, none.
It's incredible, Kitty. I can't understand it all.
Why, only last night we were together and she told me she was happy.
When did she leave?
By the first train. Took a ticket for London. She must have arrived hours ago.
Well, she's not been here.
Where is she?
Kitty, there's something I haven't understood.
I felt it in the back of my mind ever since I came home, and you know what it is.
Tell me.
Tell me!
I suppose you'd better face it, Roy.
I suppose she means for you never to see her again.
Why not?
I don't know! Don't ask me.
Kitty, what's in back of all this?
If you don't tell me, I'll go to the police. - I've got to find her.
Oh, no, don"t go to police.
Why shouldn't I?
Roy, can you take it, no matter what you find out about her?
What are you hinting?
Answer me. Can you take it?
No matter what I find out, it won't make any difference. I've got to find her.
Well, come on then.
We'll look for her.
Hello, Kitty.
Have you seen Myra?
No.
Are you sure?
Dear, I knows every bit what comes in here.
And Myra, particularly.
And when I tells you she ain't, she ain't.
All right, thanks.
Why don"t you and your gentleman here sit down here for a bite?
Seen Myra?
No, I ain't seen her for about four days.
Where is she gone? The Riviera?
If you see her, tell her I'm looking for her, will you?
All right, I will, dearie.
Say, Mack.
Hiya, sister.
Have you seen Myra?
Well, it's early for Myra. She don't usually come around till about midnight.
All right. Thanks.
Roy, she don't seem to be anywhere.
There's only one place we haven't tried.
What place is that?
Waterloo Station.
Waterloo Station, driver.
Well?
Not anywhere?
No. Nobody's seen her.
Oh, Roy, I'm scared.
Kitty.
I'm scared, I tell you. Where is she?
She... she couldn't go through with it.
She was too honest.
She said it was a chance to live.
A chance to live?
And that she'd never go back..
That she'd never go back to the...
You don't need to say it.
I understand.
Then... then where is she?
She's lost, Kitty.
She's escaped us.
And I'll always look for her.
And never find her.
Is that you, Myra?
Hello.
Heard you was married.
No.
That Kitty, she told me, said you'd got off with some toff.
I knew it was too good to be true.
Yes.
Oh, well, cheer up.
Things can't be worse.
Going down to the station?
Oh, well.
I'll be off on my lonesome then.
Toodle-0000.
I loved you.
I've never loved anyone else.
I never shall.
That's the truth, Roy.
I never shall.
Rosebud.
News on the March.
Legendary was the Xanadu where Kubla Khan decreed his stately pleasure dome.
Today, almost as legendary, is Florida's Xanadu the world's largest private pleasure ground.
Here on the deserts of the Gulf Coast, a private mountain was commissioned and successfully built.
One hundred thousand trees, twenty thousand tons of marble are the ingredients of Xanadu's mountain.
Contents of Xanadu's palace:
Paintings, pictures, statues, various stones of other palaces.
A collection of everything.
So big it can never be cataloged or appraised.
Enough for 10 museums, the loot of the world.
Xanadu's livestock the fowl of the air, the fish of the sea, the beast of the field and jungle two of each, the biggest private zoo since Noah.
Like the pharaohs Xanadu's landlord leaves many stones to mark his grave.
Since the pyramids Xanadu is the costliest monument a man has built to himself.
Here in Xanadu last week Xanadu's landlord was laid to rest.
A potent figure of our century America's Kubla Khan:
Charles Foster Kane.
Its humble beginnings, in this ramshackle building, a dying daily.
Kane's empire, in its glory held dominion over 37 newspapers, two syndicates a radio network, an empire upon an empire.
The first of grocery stores, paper mills...
apartment buildings, factories, forests, ocean liners.
An empire through which for 50 years flowed in an unending stream the wealth of the Earth's third richest gold mine.
Famed in American legend is the origin of the Kane fortune.
How, to boarding housekeeper Mary Kane, by a defaulting boarder, in 1868 was left the supposedly worthless deed to an abandoned mineshaft:
The Colorado Lode.
Fifty-seven years later, before a congressional investigation Walter P. Thatcher, grand old man of Wall Street for years chief target of Kane papers' attacks on trusts recalls a journey he made as a youth.
My firm had been appointed trustee by Mrs. Kane for a large fortune she recently acquired.
It was her wish that I take charge of this boy, Charles Foster Kane.
Chief, is it not, that on this occasion, Charles Foster Kane personally attacked you after striking you in the stomach with a sled?
I shall read to the committee a prepared statement which I have brought with me, and then refuse to answer questions.
Mr. Charles Foster Kane, in every essence of his social beliefs and by the dangerous manner he has persistently attacked American traditions of private property initiative and opportunity for advancement is, in fact, nothing more or less than a communist.
That same month in Union Square...
The words "Charles Foster Kane" are a menace to every workingman in this land.
He is today what he has always been and always will be: a fascist.
And still another opinion...
Kane urged his country's entry into one war opposed participation in another.
Swung the election to one American president at least.
Spoke for millions of Americans.
Was hated by as many more.
For 40 years appeared in Kane newsprint no public issue on which Kane papers took no stand.
No public man whom Kane himself did not support or denounce.
Often support, then denounce.
Twice married, twice divorced.
First to a president's niece Emily Norton, who left him in 1916.
Died 1918 in a motor accident with their son.
Sixteen years after his first marriage two weeks after his first divorce Kane married Susan Alexander singer, at the Town Hall in Trenton, New Jersey.
For wife two, one-time opera-singing Susan Alexander Kane built Chicago's Municipal Opera House.
Cost: $3 million.
Conceived for Susan Alexander Kane, half-finished before she divorced him the still unfinished Xanadu.
Cost: No man can say.
Kane, molder of mass opinion though he was in all his life was never granted elective office by the voters of his country.
But Kane papers were once strong indeed and once the prize seemed almost his.
In 1916, as independent candidate for governor the best elements of the state behind him the White House seemingly the next easy step in a lightning political career then suddenly, less than one week before election defeat.
Shameful, ignominious.
Defeat that set back for 20 years the cause of reform in the U. S forever canceled political chances for Charles Foster Kane.
Then, in the first year of the Great Depression a Kane paper closes.
For Kane, in four short years, collapse.
Eleven Kane papers merged, more sold, scrapped.
Is that correct?
Don't believe everything you hear on the radio.
Read the Inquirer.
How were business conditions in Europe?
How did I find business conditions in Europe, Mr. Bones?
With great difficulty.
Are you glad to be back?
I'm always glad to be back. I'm an American.
Always been an American. Anything else?
When I was a reporter, we asked them quicker than that.
What do you think of the chances for war in Europe?
I talked with the responsible leaders of England, France, Germany and Italy.
They're too intelligent to embark on a project which would mean the end of civilization.
You can take my word for it, there will be no war.
Kane helped to change the world but Kane's world now is history and the great yellow journalist himself lived to be history outlived his power to make it.
Alone in his never-finished, already decaying pleasure palace aloof, seldom visited, never photographed an emperor of newsprint continued to direct his failing empire.
Vainly attempted to sway, as he once did the destinies of a nation that had ceased to listen to him ceased to trust him.
Then last week, as it must to all men death came to Charles Foster Kane.
News on the March.
That's it. - Hello.
Hello.
Stand by.
I'll tell you if we want to run it again.
How about it, Mr. Rawlston?
How do you like it?
Seventy years in a man's life.
That's a lot to try to get into a newsreel.
It's a good short, but what it needs is an angle.
All we saw on that screen was that Charles Foster Kane is dead.
I know that. I read the papers.
It isn't enough to tell us what a man did you've got to tell us who he was.
Wait a minute.
What were Kane's last words?
Do you remember, boys?
What were the last words he said on Earth?
Maybe he told us about himself on his deathbed.
Maybe he didn't.
All we saw was a big American.
How did he differ from Ford, Hearst or John Doe? - Yeah, sure.
I tell you, a man's dying words--
What were they?
You don't read the papers.
When Charles Foster Kane died, he said one word:
Rosebud".
That's all he said?
Tough guy.
Yes, "Rosebud".
Just that one word.
But who is she?
What was it?
Here's a man who could've been president who was as loved, hated and talked about as any man in our time, but when he dies something is on his mind called Rosebud.
What does that mean?
A racehorse he bet on once. - That didn't come in.
But what was the race?
Rosebud.
Thompson.
Yes.
Hold this up a week, two if you must.
Don't you think right after he's dead-- Find out about Rosebud.
Get in touch with anybody who knew him or knew him well.
That manager of his... Uh...
Bernstein.
His second wife.
She's still living.
Susan Alexander Kane.
She runs a nightclub in Atlantic City.
That's right.
Get in touch with everybody that ever worked for him whoever loved him, whoever hated his guts.
I don't mean go through the city directory of course.
I'll get on it right away.
Good. Rosebud, dead or alive.
It will probably turn out to be a very simple thing.
Miss Alexander.
This is Mr. Thompson, Miss Alexander.
I want another drink, John.
Right away. Will you have something, Mr. Thompson?
I'll have a highball, please. - Who told you you could sit down?
I thought maybe we could have a talk.
Think again.
Can't you people leave me alone?
I'm minding my own business, you mind yours.
If I could just have a talk with you, Miss Alexander.
I'd-- Get out of here.
Get out!
Sorry.
Get out.
Maybe some other time.
Get out.
Gino.
Get her another highball.
She just won't talk to nobody, Mr. Thompson.
Okay.
Another double?
Yeah.
Hello, I want New York City.
Courtland 79970. This is Atlantic City 46827.
H9)'-
She's, uh... - Yeah.
She'll snap out of it.
Why, until he died, she'd just as soon talk about Mr. Kane as any--
Hello.
Sooner.
This is Thompson.
Mr. Rawlston?
She won't talk.
The second Mrs. Kane. About Rosebud or anything else.
I'm calling from Atlantic City.
Tomorrow I'll go to Philadelphia, to Thatcher Library, to see his diary.
They're expecting me.
Then I've a meeting with his general manager in New York.
Bernstein.
Then I'm coming back here.
Yeah, I'll see everybody that's still alive. Goodbye.
Hey... Um...
John.
You just might be able to help me.
When she used to talk about Mr. Kane, did she ever mention Rosebud?
Rosebud"?
Thank you, Mr. Thompson, thanks.
As a matter of fact, just the other day, when the papers were full of it I asked her.
She never heard of Rosebud.
The directors of the Thatcher Memorial Library have asked me to remind you about the conditions under which you may inspect certain portions of Mr. Thatcher's unpublished memoirs.
I remember them.
Yes, Jennings, I'll bring him in.
All I want is an hour--
Under no circumstances are direct quotes from his manuscript to be used by you.
You may follow me. That's all right.
Jennings.
Thank you, Jennings.
You will be required to leave this room at 4:30 promptly.
You will confine yourself, it is our understanding to the chapters in Mr. Thatcher's manuscript regarding Mr. Kane.
That's all I'm interested in.
Thank you.
Pages 83 to 142.
Come on, boys.
Be careful, Charles.
Mrs. Kane.
Pull your muffler around your neck, Charles.
Mrs. Kane, I think we'll have to tell him now.
Yes, I'll sign those papers now, Mr. Thatcher.
You people seem to forget that I'm the boy's father.
It's going to be done exactly the way I've told Mr. Thatcher.
There's nothing wrong with Colorado.
I don't see why we can't raise our son just because we came into money.
If I want to, I can go to court. A father has a right to.
A boarder that beats his bill and leaves worthless stock behind...
That property is as much my property as anybody's now that it's valuable.
And if Fred Graves had any idea this would happen, he'd have made out the certificates in both our names.
But they're made out to Mrs. Kane.
He owed the money to both of us.
The bank's decision in all matters--"
I don't hold with giving Charles to a bank--
Stop this nonsense. - We're a bit uneducated--
The bank's decision concerning his education his places of residence, is to be final".
The idea of a bank being the guardian--
Stop this nonsense, Jim.
We will assume full management of the Colorado Lode" which I repeat, Mrs. Kane, you are the sole owner.
Where do I sign, Mr. Thatcher?
Right here.
Mary, I'm asking you for the last time.
You'd think I hadn't been a good husband or father--
The sum of $50,000 a year is to be paid to you and Mr. Kane as long as you both live and thereafter to the survivor.
Let's hope it's all for the best.
Why I can't raise my own boy is more than I can understand.
Go on, Mr. Thatcher.
Everything else, the principal, as well as all monies earned is to be administered by the bank in trust for your son, Charles Foster Kane until he reaches his 25th birthday, at which time he is to come into complete possession.
Charles! Go on, Mr. Thatcher.
Well, it's almost 5.
Don't you think I'd better meet the boy'?
I've got his trunk all packed.
I've had it packed for a week now. I've arranged for a tutor to meet us in Chicago.
I'd have brought him here with me, but... - Charles.
Lookie, Mom.
You'd better come inside.
That's quite a snowman.
I took the pipe out of his mouth.
Did you make it yourself?
Maybe I'll make some teeth and whiskers.
This is Mr. Thatcher, Charles. - Hello.
How do you do, Charles?
He comes from the East.
Pa.
Hello, Charlie.
Charles.
Yes, Mommy?
Mr. Thatcher is going to take you on a trip with him tonight.
You'll be leaving on number 10.
That's the train with all the lights on it.
You going, Mom?
No. Your mother won't be going right away, but she'll...
Where am I going?
You're going to see Chicago and New York and Washington, maybe. Ain't he?
He certainly is.
I wish I were a boy going on a trip like that for the first time.
Why aren't you coming with us, Morn?
We have to stay here, Charles.
You're gonna live with Mr. Thatcher from now on, Charlie.
You're gonna be rich.
Your ma figures, well, that is me and her decided this ain't the place for you to grow up in.
You'll probably be the richest man someday... - ...and you ought to get--
You won't be lonely.
Lonely, of course not. We're going to have fine times together, we are.
Let's shake hands. Come. I'm not that frightening, am I?
What do you say? Let's shake.
Why, Charles.
Why, you almost hurt me.
Charlie!
Sleds aren't to hit people, but to sleigh with.
Mom! You got to go.
Jim!
I'm sorry, Mr. Thatcher.
What the kid needs is a good thrashing.
That's what you think, is it?
Yes. That's why he's going to be brought up where you can't get at him.
Well, Charles... -...
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.
And a happy New Year.
In closing may I remind you your 25th birthday, which is now approaching marks your complete independence from the firm of Thatcher  Company, as well as acquiring the full responsibility for the world's sixth largest private fortune.
Got that?
The world's sixth largest private fortune".
I don't think you realize the full importance of the position you are to occupy.
I am therefore enclosing for your consideration a list of your holdings, extensively cross-indexed.
Dear Mr. Thatcher". - It's from Mr. Kane.
Go on.
Sorry, I'm not interested in gold mines oil wells, shipping or real estate".
Not interested?
One item on your list intrigues me: The New York Inquirer.
A little newspaper we acquired in a foreclosure proceeding.
Don't sell it. I am coming back to take charge.
I think it would be fun to run a newspaper".
I think it would be fun to run a newspaper.
Traction Trust exposed".
Traction Trust bleeds public white".
Traction Trust smashed by Inquirer".
Landlords refuse to clear slums".
inquirer wins slum fight". Oh...
Wall Street backs copper swindle".
Copper robbers indicted".
Galleons of Spain off Jersey Coast".
Is that really your idea of how to run a newspaper?
I don't know how to run a newspaper. I try everything I can think of.
You know there's not the slightest proof this... - ...armada's off the Jersey Coast.
Hello, Mr. Bernstein.
Can you prove it isn't?
Mr. Bernstein, I'd like you to meet Mr. Thatcher. - Mr. Leland.
Hello. Mr. Thatcher, my ex-guardian.
We have no secrets from our readers. Thatcher is one of our devoted readers.
He knows what's wrong with every copy of the Inquirer since I took over. Read.
Girls delightful in Cuba. Could send you prose poems about scenery but don't feel right spending your money. Stop.
Stop.
There is no war in Cuba".
Signed "Wheeler". Any answer?
Yes. Dear Wheeler: You provide the prose poems, I'll provide the war.
That's fine. - I like it myself.
Send it right away.
I came to see you about this campaign of yours.
The Inquirer's campaign against the Public Transit Company.
Do you know anything we can use against them?
Still the college boy, eh?
I was expelled from college, a lot of colleges, you remember?
I remember. Charles, I think I should remind you of a fact you have forgotten.
You're one of the largest stockholders in the Public Transit Company.
The trouble is, you don't realize you're talking to two people.
As Charles Foster Kane who owns 82,364 shares of Public Transit Preferred. See, I do have a general idea of my holdings.
I sympathize with you.
Kane is a scoundrel his paper should be closed, a committee formed to boycott him.
If you can form such a committee, put me down for a contribution of $1000.
On the other hand, I am the publisher of the Inquirer.
As such it's my duty, I'll let you in on a little secret. it is also my pleasure to see that the working people of this community aren't robbed by a pack of money-mad pirates, just because they have no one to look after their interests.
I'll let you in on another little secret, Mr. Thatcher:
I think I'm the man to do it. You see, I have money and property.
If I don't look after the interests of the underprivileged, somebody else will.
Maybe somebody without money or property.
That would be too bad.
I saw your financial statement today.
Oh, did you?
Tell me, honestly don't you think it's rather unwise to continue this philanthropic enterprise this Inquirer, that is costing you $1 million a year?
Yes. I did lose $1 million last year. I expect to lose $1 million this year.
I expect to lose $1 million next year.
At the rate of $1 million a year I'll have to close this place in 60 years.
With respect to the said newspapers the said Charles Foster Kane hereby relinquishes all control thereof and of the syndicates pertaining thereto and any and all other newspaper, press and publishing properties of any kind and agrees to abandon all claim thereto--"
Which means we're bust all right.
Well, out of cash.
All right, Mr. Bernstein.
I've read it, Mr. Thatcher, just let me sign it and go home.
You're too old to call me Mr. Thatcher, Charles.
You're too old to be called anything else.
You were always too old.
In consideration thereof, Thatcher  Company agrees to pay to Charles Foster Kane, as long as he lives--"
My allowance.
You will continue to maintain over your newspapers a large measure of control.
Measure of control".
And we shall seek your advice.
This depression is temporary.
There's always the chance that you'll die richer than I will.
It's a cinch I'll die richer than I was born.
We never lost as much as we made.
Yes, yes, but your methods.
You know, Charles you never made a single investment. You always used money to...
To buy things.
To buy things.
My mother should have chosen a less reliable banker.
I always gagged on that silver spoon.
You know, Mr. Bernstein if I hadn't been very rich I might have been a really great man.
Don't you think you are?
I think I did pretty well under the circumstances.
What would you like to have been? Everything you hate.
Oh...
I beg your pardon, sir?
What did you say?
It's 4:30. Isn't it, Jennings?
Yes, ma'am.
You have enjoyed a very rare privilege, young man.
Did you find what you were looking for?
You're not Rosebud, are you?
What?
Rosebud, and your name is Jennings, isn't it?
Goodbye, everybody.
Who's a busy man, me?
I'm chairman of the board.
I got nothing but time.
What do you want to know? We thought maybe...
If we could find out what he meant by his last words...
...as he was dying. - That "Rosebud"?
Maybe some girl?
There were a lot of them in the early days.
It's hardly likely that Mr. Kane could have met someone casually and then 50 years later, on his deathbed--
Well, you're pretty young, Mr. Thompson.
A fellow will remember a lot of things you wouldn't think he'd remember.
You take me.
One day, back in 1896, I was crossing over to Jersey on the ferry and as we pulled out, there was another ferry pulling in and on it there was a girl waiting to get off.
A white dress she had on.
She was carrying a white parasol.
I only saw her for one second.
She didn't see me at all, but I'll bet a month hasn't gone by since that I haven't thought of that girl.
Who else have you been to see?
Well, I went down to Atlantic City.
Susie?
Thank you.
I called her myself the day after he died.
I thought maybe somebody ought to.
She couldn't even come to the phone.
I'll be seeing her again in a couple of days.
About Rosebud, Mr. Bernstein.
If you'd talk about anything connected with Mr. Kane that you can remember.
You were with him from the beginning.
From before the beginning, young fellow.
And now it's after the end.
Have you tried to see anybody except Susie?
I haven't seen anybody else, but I've been through Walter Thatcher's journal.
That man was the biggest fool I ever met.
He made an awful lot of money.
Well, it's no trick to make a lot of money if all you want is to make a lot of money.
You take Mr. Kane.
It wasn't money he wanted.
Thatcher never did figure him out. Sometimes even I couldn't.
You know who you ought to see?
Mr. Leland.
He was Mr. Kane's closest friend. They went to school together.
Harvard?
Oh, Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Cornell, Switzerland.
He was thrown out of a lot of colleges.
Mr. Leland never had a nickel.
One of those families where the father is worth $10 million then one day he shoots himself, and it turns out there's nothing but debts.
He was with Mr. Kane and me the first day Mr. Kane took over the Inquirer.
Take a good look at it, Jedediah.
It's going to look a lot different one of these days. Come on.
There ain't no bedrooms in this joint. That's a newspaper building.
You're getting paid, mister, for opinions or for hauling? Ugh.
Jedediah.
After you, Mr. Kane.
Excuse me, sir, but I...
Welcome, Mr. Kane.
Welcome.
Welcome to the Inquirer, Mr. Kane.
I am Herbert Carter, the editor-in-chief.
Thank you, Mr. Carter. This is Mr. Leland--
How do you do, Mr. Leland?
Our new dramatic critic. I hope I haven't made a mistake.
It is dramatic critic, right?
That's right.
Are they standing for me?
You? Oh, Mr. Kane.
Standing?
How do you do? - How do you do?
I thought it would be a nice little gesture.
Ask them to sit down, will you, please.
The new publisher.
You may resume your duties, gentlemen.
Thank you.
I didn't know your plans.
I don't know my plans myself.
Matter of fact, I haven't got any plans.
No?
Except to get out a newspaper.
Whoops. - Mr. Bernstein.
Yes, Mr. Kane.
Mr. Carter, this is Mr. Bernstein.
Mr. Bernstein is my general manager.
How do you do, Mr. Carter?
Mr. Carter.
How do you do?
Yes, Mr. Bernstein.
Stein.
Kane. - Mr. Carter, is this your office?
My little private sanctum is at your disposal.
Excuse me.
But I don't understand.
Mr. Carter, I'm going to live right here in your office as long as I have to.
Live here?
Yes?
Excuse me.
But a morning newspaper, after all--
Excuse me.
We're practically closed for 12 hours a day.
That's one of the things that's going to have to be changed here. - The news goes on for 24 hours a day.
Twenty-four?
That's right.
Excuse me.
It's impossible...
I've drawn that cartoon. I'm no good as a cartoonist.
You certainly aren't.
You're the dramatic critic, Leland.
You still eating?
I'm still hungry.
Here's a front-page story in the Chronicle about a Mrs. Harry Silverstone in Brooklyn who's missing.
She's probably murdered. Why isn't there something about it in the Inquirer?
We're running a newspaper...
I'm absolutely starving to death.
...not a scandal sheet.
That's all right.
Mr. Carter, here is a three-column headline in the Chronicle.
Why hasn't the Inquirer a three-column headline?
The news wasn't big enough. - Mm-hm.
Mr. Carter, if the headline is big enough, it makes the news big enough.
That's right!
The murder of Mrs. Harry Silverstone--
There's no proof that she was murdered, or dead. It says she's missing.
The neighbors are getting suspicious.
It's not our function to report the gossip of housewives.
If we were interested in that kind of thing, we could fill the paper twice over, daily.
That's the kind of thing we are going to be interested in from now on.
I want you to send your best man to see Mr. Silverstone.
Have him tell Mr. Silverstone if he doesn't produce his wife, Mrs. Silverstone...
...the Inquirer will have him arrested. - Wha--?
Tell Mr. Silverstone he's a detective from, uh...
Central Office.
The Central Office.
If Mr. Silverstone gets suspicious and asks to see your man's badge your man is to get indignant and call Mr. Silverstone an anarchist.
Loudly, so the neighbors can hear. You ready for dinner, Jedediah?
I can't see that the function of a respectable newspaper--
Thank you so much, Mr. Carter. Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Paper!
Read all about it! Read all about it in the early morning Chronicle.
The mystery of the lady that vanished in Brooklyn.
Read all about it in the early morning Chronicle.
We'll be on the street soon, Charlie, another 10 minutes.
Three hours and 50 minutes late, but we did it.
Tired?
A tough day.
A wasted day.
Wasted?
You only made the paper over four times tonight, that's all.
I've changed the front page a little, Mr. Bernstein. That's not enough.
There's something I've got to get into this paper besides pictures and print.
I've got to make the New York Inquirer as important to New York as the gas in that light.
What are you going to do, Charlie?
My Declaration of Principles.
Don't smile, Jedediah.
I've got it all written out here.
You don't want to make any promises you don't want to keep.
These'll be kept.
I'll provide the people of this city with a daily paper that will tell all the news honestly. - I will also provide--"
That's two sentences starting with
People will know who's responsible and they'll get the truth in the Inquirer, quickly, simply and entertainingly.
No special interests will be allowed to interfere with that truth.
I will also provide them with a fighting and tireless champion of their rights as citizens and as human beings".
Signed:
Charles Foster Kane". - Can I have that, Charlie?
I'm going to print it.
SOIIy!
Yes, Mr. Kane?
I want you to run this editorial in a box on the front page.
This morning's front page?
That's right, Solly, that means we'll have to remake again.
Yes.
Go down and tell them.
All right.
Solly. When you're through with that, I'd like to have it back.
I'd like to keep that particular piece of paper myself.
I have a hunch it might turn out to be something pretty important.
A document...
Sure.
...like the Declaration of independence and the Constitution and my first report card at school.
I know you're tired, gentlemen, but I brought you here for a reason. - This little pilgrimage will do us good.
The Chronicle's a good newspaper.
Chronicle's a good idea for a newspaper. Notice the circulation.
495,000. But look who's working for the Chronicle.
With them, it's no trick to get circulation.
You're right.
You know how long it took the Chronicle to get that staff together?
Twenty years.
Twenty years?
Six years ago, I looked at a picture of the world's greatest newspaper men.
I felt like a kid in front of a candy store.
Tonight, six years later, I got my candy, all of it.
Welcome, gentlemen, to the Inquirer.
Make an extra copy of that picture and mail it to the Chronicle.
It'll make you all happy to learn that our circulation this morning was the greatest in New York: 684,000.
684,132.
Right.
I hope you'll forgive my rudeness in taking leave of you.
I'm going abroad next week for a vacation.
I've promised my doctor for sometime that I would leave when I could.
I now realize I can't.
Say, Mr. Kane, as long as you're promising there's a lot of pictures and statues in Europe you ain't bought yet.
You can't blame me, Mr. Bernstein.
They've been making statues for 2000 years.
And I've only been buying for five.
Promise me, Mr. Kane.
I promise, Mr. Bernstein.
Thank you.
Mr. Bernstein?
You don't expect me to keep any of those promises, do you?
And now, gentlemen!
Your complete attention, if you please.
Are we going to declare war on Spain?
Oh, mama, here they come.
Shoot me while I'm happy.
I said, "Are we going to declare war on Spain, or are we not?"
The Inquirer already has.
You long-faced, overdressed anarchist.
I am not overdressed.
You are, too.
Mr. Bernstein, look at his necktie.
Let's have the song about Charlie.
Is there a song about Charlie?
Is there a song about you, Mr. Kane?
You buy a bag of peanuts in this town, you get a song written about you.
I've seen that fellow.
He's good. Good evening, Mr. Kane.
There is a man - There is a man - A certain man
A certain man And for the poor you may be sure That he'll do all he can
Who is this one? - Who is this one?
This favorite son - This favorite son
Just by his action Has the traction magnates on the run
Who loves to smoke - Who loves to smoke - Enjoys a joke
Ha-ha-ha Who wouldn't get a bit upset If he were really broke
With wealth and fame - With wealth and fame He's still the same
I'll bet you five you're not alive If you don't know his name
What is his name?
It's Charlie Kane, it's Mister Kane!
He doesn't like that Mister He likes good old Charlie Kane
Isn't it wonderful? Such a party.
Yes.
What's the matter?
Who says a miss was made to kiss
And when he meets one Always tries to do exactly this
Who buys the food Who buys the drinks
Who thinks that dough was made to spend And acts the way he thinks
Now is it, Joe, no, no, no
Bernstein, these men who are now with the Inquirer who were with the Chronicle until yesterday--
Oh, mama, please. - Give me that.
What?
The blond?
No, the brunette.
Where did you learn that, Charlie?
Bernstein, these men who were with the Chronicle weren't they just as devoted to the Chronicle policy as they are now to our policies?
Sure, they're just like anybody else.
They got work to do, they do it.
Only they happen to be the best men in the business.
Do we stand for the same things the Chronicle stands for?
Certainly not.
Listen, Mr. Kane, he'll have them changed to his kind of newspapermen in a week.
There's always a chance, of course, that they'll change Mr. Kane.
Without his knowing it.
Mr. Leland, I got a cable from Mr. Kane!
I got a cable from Mr. Kane.
What?
From Paris, France.
What?
From Paris, France.
Who by his action Has the traction magnates on the run
It's a good thing he promised not to send back any more statues.
Bernstein, Bernstein. Look, he wants to buy the world's biggest diamond.
Why didn't you go to Europe with him?
He wanted you to.
I wanted Charlie to have fun, with me along...
Bernstein, am I a stuffed shirt?
Am I a horse-faced hypocrite?
Am I a New England schoolmarm?
Yes.
If you thought I'd answer you different from what Mr. Kane tells you, I wouldn't.
World's biggest diamond".
I didn't know Charlie was collecting diamonds.
He ain't.
He's collecting somebody that's collecting diamonds.
Anyway, he ain't only collecting statues.
Welcome home, Mr. Kane from 467 employees of the New York inquirer".
Here he comes!
Welcome, Mr. Kane.
I know I've a mustache.
It looks awful. Have we got a society editor?
Right here, Mr. Kane.
Miss Townsend is the society editor.
Miss Townsend, this is Mr. Charles Foster Kane. Uh-
Miss Townsend, I've been away so long.
I don't know your routine.
I got a little social announcement.
I wish you wouldn't treat it any differently than you would any other social announcement.
Mr. Kane, on behalf of all the employees of the inquirer--
Mr. Bernstein, thank you very much, everybody, I...
I'm sorry, I can't accept it now.
Goodbye.
Say, he was in an awful hurry.
Hey, everybody, look out here.
Let's go to the window.
Mr. Leland!
Mr. Bernstein!
Yes, Ms. Townsend?
This announcement:
Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Monroe Norton announce the engagement of their daughter, Emily Monroe Norton...
...to Mr. Charles Foster Kane".
Huh? Come on.
Emily Monroe Norton, she's the niece of the President of the United States.
President's niece?
Before he's through, she'll be a president's wife.
The way things turned out, I don't need to tell you.
Miss Emily Norton was no rosebud.
It didn't end very well, did it?
It ended.
Then there was Susie. That ended too.
You know, Mr. Thompson, I was thinking this Rosebud you're trying to find out about...
Yes?
Maybe that was something he lost.
Mr. Kane was a man who lost almost everything he had.
You ought to see Jed Leland.
Of course, he and Mr. Kane didn't exactly see eye to eye.
You take the Spanish-American war.
I guess Mr. Leland was right. That was Mr. Kane's war.
We didn't really have anything to fight about.
Do you think if it hadn't been for that war of Mr. Kane's we'd have the Panama Canal?
I wish I knew where Mr. Leland was.
A lot of the time now they don't tell me these things.
Maybe even he's dead.
In case you'd like to know he's at the Huntington Memorial Hospital on 180th Street.
You don't say.
I had-- Nothing particular the matter with him, they tell me, just...
Just old age.
It's the only disease that you don't look forward to being cured of.
I can remember absolutely everything, young man. That's my curse.
That's one of the greatest curses ever inflicted on the human race: memory.
I was his oldest friend, and as far as I was concerned, he behaved like a swine.
Not that Charlie was ever brutal. He just did brutal things.
Maybe I wasn't his friend, but if I wasn't, he never had one.
Maybe I was what you nowadays call a stooge.
You were about to say something about Rosebud.
Do you happen to have a good cigar?
I've got a young physician here who thinks I'm going to give up smoking.
No, I'm afraid I haven't. Sorry. - Oh, oh.
Ha, ha.
I changed the subject, didn't I?
What a disagreeable old man I have become.
You're a reporter and you want to know what I think about Charlie Kane.
Well... Heh.
I suppose he had some private sort of greatness. But he kept it to himself.
He never gave himself away. He never gave anything away. He just left you a tip.
He had a generous mind. I don't suppose anybody ever had so many opinions.
But he never believed in anything except Charlie Kane. He never had a conviction except Charlie Kane in his life.
I suppose he died without one.
That must have been pretty unpleasant.
Of course, a lot of us check out without having any special convictions about death.
But we do know what we're leaving. We do believe in something.
Are you absolutely sure you haven't got a cigar?
Sorry, Mr. Leland.
Never mind. - What do you know about Rosebud?
Rosebud"?
Oh. Oh. His dying words: "Rosebud".
I saw that in the Inquirer.
I never believed anything I saw in the Inquirer.
Anything else?
I can tell you about Emily. I went to dancing school with Emily.
I was very graceful.
We were talking about the first Mrs. Kane.
What was she like?
She was like all the girls I knew in dancing school.
Very nice girl. Emily was a little nicer.
After the first couple of months she and Charlie didn't see much of each other except at breakfast.
It was a marriage just like any other marriage.
You're beautiful.
I can't be. Yes, you are.
You're very beautiful. I've never been to six parties in one night before.
I've never been up this late.
It's a matter of habit.
What will the servants think?
That we enjoyed ourselves.
Why do you have to go straight off to the newspaper?
You never should've married a newspaperman, they're worse than sailors.
I absolutely adore you.
Charles, even newspapermen have to sleep.
I'll call Mr. Bernstein and have him put off my appointments till noon.
What time is it?
I don't know.
It's early.
Charles...
Do you know how long you kept me waiting last night when you went to the newspaper for 10 minutes?
What do you do in a newspaper in the middle of the night?
My dear, your only correspondent is the Inquirer.
Sometimes I think I'd prefer a rival of flesh and blood.
I don't spend that much time on the newspaper.
It isn't just the time.
It's what you print, attacking the president.
You mean Uncle John.
I mean the president of the United States.
He's still Uncle John and a well-meaning fathead who's letting a pack of high-pressure crooks run his administration.
This whole oil scandal--
He happens to be the president, not you.
That's a mistake that will be corrected one of these days.
Your Mr. Bernstein sent Junior the most incredible atrocity yesterday.
I simply can't have it in the nursery.
Mr. Bernstein is apt to pay a visit to the nursery now and then.
Does he have to?
Yes.
Really, Charles, people will think--
What I tell them to think.
Wasn't he ever in love with her?
He married for love.
Love.
That is why he did everything.
That's why he went into politics.
It seems we weren't enough. He wanted all the voters to love him too.
All he wanted out of life was love.
That's Charlie's story. How he lost it.
You see, he just didn't have any to give.
He loved Charlie Kane, of course.
Very dearly.
And his mother, I guess he always loved her.
How about his second wife?
Susan Alexander?
You know what Charlie called her?
The day after he'd met her, he told me about her.
He said she was "a cross-section of the American public".
I guess he couldn't help it. She must have had something for him.
That first night, according to Charlie all she had was a toothache.
What are you laughing at, young lady? Ooh.
What's the matter with you?
Toothache.
What?
Toothache.
Toothache?
Oh.
Oh. You mean you've got a toothache. - What's funny about that?
You're funny, mister.
You've got dirt on your face.
Not dirt, it's mud.
Do you want some hot water?
I live right here.
What's that, young lady?
I said, if you wanted some hot water I could get you some hot water.
All right, thank you very much.
Do I look any better now?
This medicine doesn't do a bit of good.
What you need is to get your mind off it.
Hey.
Excuse me, but my landlady prefers me to keep this door open...
...when I have a gentleman caller.
All right.
Oh.
You have got a toothache, haven't you?
I surely have.
Why don't you try laughing at me again?
What?
I'm still pretty funny.
I know, but you don't want me to laugh at you.
I don't want your tooth to hurt, either. - Ooh.
Look at me.
See that?
What are you doing?
I'm wiggling both my ears at the same time.
That's it, smile.
It took me two solid years at the best boys' school in the world to learn that.
The fellow who taught me is now president of Venezuela.
That's it!
Is it a giraffe?
No, not a giraffe.
I bet it is.
What? Well, then it's an elephant.
It's supposed to be a rooster.
A rooster!
You know an awful lot of tricks. Are you a professional magician?
No, I'm not a magician.
I was just joking.
You really don't know who I am?
You told me your name, Mr. Kane, but I'm awfully ignorant. I guess you caught on to that.
I bet I've heard your name a million times.
You really like me though, even though you don't know who I am?
I surely do. You've been wonderful.
Without you I don't know what I would have done.
I had a toothache, and I don't know many people.
I know too many people.
I guess we're both lonely.
Want to know what I was going to do before I ruined my best Sunday clothes?
I bet they're not your best Sunday clothes. You probably have more.
I was just joking.
I was on my way to the Western Manhattan Warehouse in search of my youth.
You see, my mother died a long time ago.
Her things were put in storage out West. There wasn't any other place to put them.
I thought I'd send for them now. Tonight I was going to take a look at them.
A sort of sentimental journey.
I run a couple of newspapers. What do you do?
Me? - Mm-hm.
How old did you say you were?
I didn't say.
If you had, I wouldn't have asked you. - How old?
Pretty old.
How old?
Twenty-two in August.
That's a ripe old age. What do you do?
I work at Seligman's. I'm in charge of the sheet music.
Is that what you want to do?
No, I wanted to be a singer, I guess.
That is, I didn't. My mother did for me.
What happened to the singing?
Mother always thought- - She always talked about grand opera for me. Imagine.
But my voice isn't that kind.
It's just, you know what mothers are like.
Yes, I know.
Have you got a piano? - A piano?
Mm-hm.
Yes, there's one in the parlor.
Would you sing for me?
You wouldn't want to hear me sing.
Yes, I would.
Don't tell me your toothache is bothering you.
No, that's all gone.
All right.
Let's go to the parlor.
Yes, Lindor shall be mine
I have sworn it
For weal or woe
Yes, Lindor
There is only one man who can rid the politics of this state of the evil domination of Boss Jim Gettys.
I am speaking of Charles Foster Kane, the fighting liberal the friend of the workingman, the next governor of this state who entered upon this campaign... with one purpose only:
To point out and make public the dishonesty the downright villainy of Boss Jim W. Gettys' political machine now in complete control of the government of this state.
I made no campaign promises because, until a few weeks ago, I had no hope of being elected.
Now, however, I have something more than a hope.
Jim Gettys has something less than a chance.
Every straw vote every independent poll shows that I will be elected.
Very well.
Now I can afford to make some promises.
The workingman and the slum child know they can expect my best efforts in their interests.
The decent, ordinary citizens know that I'll do everything in my power to protect the underprivileged, the underpaid, and the underfed.
Mother, is Pop governor yet?
Not yet, Junior.
I'd make my promises now if I weren't too busy arranging to keep them.
But here's one promise I'll make and Boss Jim Gettys knows I'll keep it.
My first official act as governor of this state will be to appoint a special district attorney to arrange for the indictment prosecution and conviction of Boss Jim W. Gettys.
If the election were held today, you'd be in by 100,000 votes.
Gettys isn't even pretending. - Pop.
Hello, son. - He isn't just scared, he's sick.
It's beginning to dawn on Jim Gettys I mean what I say.
Did you like your old man's speech?
I could hear every word.
Hello, Emily.
Hold it.
Great speech, Mr. Kane. - Wonderful.
Will you get us a taxi?
A taxi? Why? I thought--
I'm sending Junior home in the car with Oliver.
Good night, Father.
Goodbye, son.
Emily...
Why did you send Junior home in the car?
What are you doing in a taxi?
There's a call I want you to make with me.
It can wait.
No, it can't.
What's this all about, Emily?
It may not be about anything at all. I intend to find out.
Where are you going?
I'm going to "185 West 74th Street".
If you wish, you may come with me.
I'll come with you.
I had no idea you had this flair for melodrama, Emily.
Come right in, Mr. Kane.
Charlie.
He forced me to send your wife that letter.
I didn't want to. He's been saying the most terrible...
Mrs. Kane.
I don't suppose anybody would introduce us.
I'm Mm (Betty's.
Yes?
I made Miss Alexander send you the note, Mrs. Kane.
She didn't want to at first. But she did it.
Charlie, the things he said to me.
He threatened to--
I won't wait until I'm elected. To start with, I think I'll break your neck.
Maybe you can do it, and maybe you can't.
Charles, your breaking this man's neck would scarcely explain this note:
Serious consequences for Mr. Kane, for yourself and for your son".
He wanted to get her to come here--
What does this note mean?
I'm Susan Alexander. I know what you think--
What does this note mean, Ms. Alexander?
She don't know. She sent it because I told her it wouldn't be smart not to.
Emily, this gentleman--
I'm not a gentleman.
Your husband is only trying to be funny calling me one.
I don't even know what a gentleman is.
You see, my idea of a gentleman...
If I owned a paper and didn't like the way somebody was doing things some politician, I'd fight him with all I had.
I wouldn't show him in a convict suit so his children could see his picture in the paper.
You're a cheap, crooked grafter--
We're talking now about what you are.
I'm fighting for my life, not just my political life.
He said unless you--
That's what I said.
Here's the chance I'm willing to give him. It's more of a chance than he'd give me.
Unless he decides by tomorrow that he's so sick he has to go away for a year Monday morning, all papers in the state, except his, will carry the story I'll give.
What story?
The story about him and Ms. Alexander.
There isn't any story! Shut up.
We've got evidence that would look bad in the headlines.
Do you want me to give you the evidence?
I'd rather he withdrew without having the story published.
Not that I care about him, but I'd be better off that way.
So would you, Mrs. Kane.
What about me?
He said my name would be dragged through the mud. That everywhere I went--
There seems to be only one decision you can make, Charles.
I'd say that it'd been made for you.
You can't tell me the voters of this state--
I'm not interested in the voters of this state right now.
I am interested in our son.
Charlie, if they publish this story--
They won't.
Good night, Mr. Gettys.
Are you coming, Charles?
No.
I'm staying here.
I can fight this all alone.
If you don't listen to reason, it may be too late.
Too late? For what?
For you and this public thief to take the love of the people away from me?
You got other things to think about. Your little boy.
You don't want him to read about you in the papers.
There's only one person in the world to decide what I'll do.
You decided what you were going to do, Charles, some time ago.
You're making a bigger fool of yourself than I thought.
I've got nothing to say to you.
You're licked--
Get out.
If you want to see me, have the warden write me a letter.
If it was anybody else, I'd say what's going to happen to you would be a lesson to you.
Only you're going to need more than one lesson.
And you'll get more than one lesson.
Don't worry about me, Gettys.
Don't worry about me!
I'm Charles Foster Kane!
I'm no cheap, crooked politician trying to save himself from the consequences of his crimes!
Gettys!
I'm gonna send you to Sing Sing.
Sing Sing, Gettys.
Have you a car, Mrs. Kane?
Yes, thank you.
Good night.
Good night.
Paper. Read all about it.
Extra, extra.
Paper? - No, thanks.
With a million majority already against him and the church counties still to be heard from I'm afraid we got no choice.
This one?
That one.
Good night again.
Is there anything I can--?
No, thanks, Mr. Bernstein.
You better go home and get some sleep.
You too.
Good night, Mr. Kane.
Hello, Jedediah.
I'm drunk.
If you've got drunk to talk to me about Ms. Alexander, don't bother.
I'm not interested.
I've set back the sacred cause of reform, is that it?
All right.
If that's the way they want it, the people have made their choice.
It's obvious the people prefer Jim Gettys to me.
You talk about the people as though you owned them.
As though they belong to you. Goodness.
As long as I can remember, you've talked about giving the people their rights as if you could make them a present of liberty as a reward for services rendered.
Jed.
You remember the workingman?
I'll get drunk too, Jedediah if it'll do any good.
It won't do any good. Besides you never get drunk.
You used to write an awful lot about the workingman--
Go on home.
He's turning into something called "organized labor".
You won't like that one little bit when you find out it means your workingman expects something as his right, and not your gift.
When your precious underprivileged really get together...
Oh, boy...
That'll add up to something bigger than your privilege then I don't know what you'll do.
Sail away to a desert island probably and lord it over the monkeys.
I wouldn't worry about it too much.
There'll probably be a few of them there to tell me when I do something wrong.
You may not always be so lucky.
You're not very drunk.
Drunk, what do you care?
You don't care about anything except you.
You persuade people that you love them so much that they ought to love you back.
Only you want love on your own terms.
It's something to be played your way, according to your rules.
Let me work on the Chicago paper.
What?
You said you were looking for someone to do dramatic "crimitism", criticism.
I am drunk.
I want to go to Chicago.
You're too valuable here.
There's nothing left for me to do--
All right, you can go to Chicago.
Thank you.
I guess I'd better try to get drunk anyway.
I warn you, Jedediah, you won't like Chicago.
The wind comes off the lake, and they've probably never heard of Lobster Newburg.
Will Saturday after next be all right?
Anytime you say.
Thank you.
A toast to love on my terms. Those are the only terms anybody knows:
His own.
Mr. Kane, I'm from the Inquirer.
What's that, young man?
Are you through with politics?
Am I through with politics?
I should say vice versa.
We're going to be an opera star.
Are you singing at the Metropolitan?
We certainly are.
Charlie said if I didn't, he'd build me an opera house.
That won't be necessary.
No, no, no!
Places, please!
Mr. Leland is writing it from the dramatic angle?
We've covered it from the news end.
And the social.
How about the music notice?
Yes, it's already made up.
Mr. Mowan wrote a swell review.
Enthusiastic?
Yes, sir. - Naturally.
Mr. Bernstein.
Mr. Kane. - Mr. Kane.
This is a surprise.
We've got two spreads of pictures.
The music notice on the front page?
But there's still one notice to come.
The dramatic notice.
Mr. Bernstein, that's Mr. Leland, isn't it?
Yes, we're waiting for it.
Where is he?
Right in there, Mr. Kane.
Mr. Kane...
Mr. Leland and Mr. Kane haven't spoken together for years.
You don't suppose--
There's nothing to suppose.
Excuse me.
Close the door.
He ain't been drinking before.
Never. We would have heard.
What does it say there?
The notice, what's he written?
Miss Susan Alexander, a pretty but hopelessly incompetent amateur last night opened the new Chicago Opera House in a performance of..".
I still can't pronounce that name.
Her singing, happily, is no concern of this department.
Of her acting, it is absolutely impossible to..".
Go on.
Go on.
That's all there is.
Of her acting it is absolutely impossible to say anything except that, in the opinion of this reviewer, it represents a new low".
In the opinion of this reviewer.
I didn't see that.
It isn't here, Mr. Bernstein, I'm dictating it.
Mr. Kane, I--
Get me a typewriter.
I'm going to finish Mr. Leland's notice.
Hello, Bernstein.
Hello.
Hello, Mr. Leland.
Where's my notice, Bernstein?
I've got to finish my notice.
Mr. Kane is finishing it for you.
Charlie?
Charlie out there?
I guess he's fixing it up.
I knew I'd never get that through.
Mr. Kane's finishing your review just the way you started it.
He's writing a bad notice like you wanted it to be.
I guess that'll show you.
Hello, Jedediah.
Hello, Charlie.
I didn't know we were speaking.
Sure we're speaking, Jedediah.
You're fired.
Everybody knows that story, Mr. Leland, but why did he do it?
How could a man write a notice--
You just don't know Charlie.
He thought that by finishing that notice he'd show me he was an honest man.
He was always trying to prove something.
That whole thing about Susie being an opera singer.
That was trying to prove something.
You know what the headline was the day before the election?
Candidate Kane found in love nest with 'singer'".
He was going to take the quotes off the singer.
Hey, nurse!
Five years ago he wrote from that place down there in the South.
What's it called, Shangri-la?
El Dorado?
Sloppy Joe's? What's the name?
All right, Xanadu, I knew it all the time.
You caught on, didn't you?
I'm not that hard to see through.
Well, I never even answered his letter.
Maybe I should have.
I guess he was pretty lonely down there in that coliseum all those years.
He hadn't finished it when she left him.
He never finished it.
He never finished anything except my notice.
Of course, he built the joint for her.
That must have been love.
I don't know. He was disappointed in the world so he built his own, an absolute monarchy.
It was something bigger than an opera house anyway.
Nurse.
Yes, Mr. Leland.
I'm coming.
There's one thing you can do for me.
Sure. Stop at the cigar store on your way out, and get me a couple of good cigars.
Be glad to.
Thank you.
One is enough.
When I was a young man, there was an impression that nurses were pretty. Well, it was no truer then than it is today.
I'll take your arm.
All right.
You won't forget about those cigars?
I won't.
Have them wrapped like toothpaste, or they'll stop them at the desk.
You know that young doctor I was telling you about, well he's got an idea he wants to keep me alive.
I'd rather you'd just talk.
Anything that comes into your mind about yourself and Mr. Kane.
You don't want to hear what comes into my mind about myself and Charlie Kane.
You know, maybe I shouldn't have sung for Charlie that first time I met him.
But I did an awful lot of singing after that.
I sang for teachers at $100 an hour.
The teachers got that, I didn't.
What did you get?
I didn't get a thing, except music lessons.
That's all there was in it.
He married you, didn't he?
He didn't mention anything about marriage until after it was over and until it got in the papers about us and he lost the election, and that Norton woman divorced him.
He was really interested in my voice.
Why did he build that opera house?
I didn't want it. I didn't want a thing. It was his idea.
Everything was his idea except my leaving him.
Don't forget. Ta-ta-ta, ta-ta-ta, ta-ta-ta.
Don't get nervous.
Please. Let's come back.
Look at me, Mrs. Kane, darling.
Get the voice out of the throat Place the tone right in the mask
Diaphragm.
You're out of pitch.
Some people can sing. Some can't.
Impossible. Impossible!
It's not your job to give your opinion of Mrs. Kane's talents.
You're supposed to train her voice, Signor Matiste.
Nothing more.
Please continue with the lesson.
But, Mr. Kane.
Please.
I'll be the laughingstock of the musical world. People will think--
You're concerned what people will think?
Perhaps I can enlighten you a bit. I'm an authority on what people will think.
The newspapers for example.
I run several newspapers between here and San Francisco.
It's all right, darling.
Signor Matiste is going to listen to reason.
How can I persuade you--
You can't.
It's all right, darling, go ahead.
I thought you'd see it my way.
No, no, no.
I think it's dreadful.
Stop telling me he's your friend.
A friend don't write that kind of review.
All these other papers panning me, I could expect that.
But for the Inquirer to run a thing like that, spoiling my whole debut.
Come in.
I'll get it.
Friend.
Not the kind of friends I know but I'm not high class like you.
And I never went to any swell schools.
That'll be enough, Susan.
From Mr. Leland, sir.
Jed Leland?
He wanted me to make sure you got this personally.
Is that something from him?
Charlie!
As for you, you ought to have your head examined.
Sending him a letter telling him he's fired with a $25,000 check in it.
What kind of firing do you call that?
You did send him a check for $25,000, didn't you?
Yes.
I sent him a check for $25,000. What's that?
Declaration of Principles.
What?
What is it? - Hmm?
An antique.
You're awful funny, aren't you?
I'll tell you one thing you're not going to be funny about, and that's my singing.
I'm through.
I never wanted to do it in the first place.
You'll continue with your singing, Susan.
I don't propose to have myself made ridiculous.
You don't propose to have yourself made ridiculous!
What about me?
I'm the one that has to sing.
I'm the one that gets the raspberries.
Why don't you leave me alone?
My reasons satisfy me, Susan.
You seem unable to understand them.
I will not tell them to you again.
You'll continue with your singing.
Get Dr. Corey.
Susan.
She'll be perfectly all right in a clay or two, Mr. Kane.
I can't imagine how Mrs. Kane came to make such a foolish mistake.
The sedative Dr. Wagner gave her was in a somewhat larger bottle.
The strain of preparing for the new opera has excited and confused her.
Yes, I'm sure that was it.
No objections to my staying with her, are there?
No, not at all. I'd like the nurse to be here too.
Good night, Mr. Kane.
Charlie.
I couldn't make you see how I felt, Charlie.
But I couldn't go through with the singing again.
You don't know what it means to know that people are...
That the whole audience doesn't want you.
That's when you got to fight them.
All right.
You won't have to fight them anymore. It's their loss.
What are you doing?
Jigsaw puzzles?
Charlie, what time is it?
41:30.
In New York?
Hmm?
I said what time is it in New York?
41:30.
Night?
Mm-hm.
The Bulldog's just gone to press.
Well, hurray for the Bulldog. Gee, 11:30.
Shows are just getting out.
People are going to nightclubs and restaurants.
Of course, we're different because we live in a palace.
You always said you wanted to live in a palace.
A person could go crazy in this dump.
Nobody to talk to, nobody to have any fun with. Susan.
49,000 acres of nothing but scenery and statues.
I'm lonesome.
Until yesterday, we've had no less than 50 of your friends at any one time.
I think if you look in the west wing you'll find about a dozen vacationists still in residence.
You make a joke out of everything.
Charlie, I want to go to New York. I'm tired of being a hostess.
I want to have fun.
Please, Charlie.
Charlie, please.
Our home is here, Susan.
I don't care to visit New York.
What are you doing?
One thing I can never understand:
How do you know you haven't done it before?
It makes a whole lot more sense than collecting statues.
You may be right.
I sometimes wonder but you get into the habit.
It's not a habit, I do it because I like it.
I thought we might have a picnic tomorrow.
Huh?
I thought we might have a picnic tomorrow.
Invite everybody to spend the night at the Everglades.
Invite everybody. Order everybody, you mean, and make them sleep in tents.
Who wants to sleep in tents when they've got their own room with a bath, where they know where everything is?
I thought we might have a picnic tomorrow.
You never give me anything I really care about.
It can't be love
For there is no true love
I know I've played at the game
Like a moth in a blue flame
Lost in the end Just the same
All these years
My heart's been floating around In a puddle of tears
Mm, I wonder what it is
Sure, you give me things, but that don't mean anything to you.
You're in a tent, darling, you aren't at home.
I can hear you very well if you speak in a normal tone of voice.
What's the difference between giving me a bracelet or giving someone $100,000..
...for a statue you'll keep crated up and never look at?
It's just money. It doesn't mean anything.
You never really gave me anything that you care about.
I want you to stop this.
I'm not going to stop it.
Right now. - You never gave me anything in your life.
You just tried to buy me into giving you something.
Susan!
It can't be love - It can't be love
Whatever I do, I do because I love you.
You don't love me.
You want me to love you.
Sure. "I'm Charles Foster Kane.
Whatever you want, just name it and it's yours.
But you gotta love me".
Don't tell me you're sorry.
I'm not sorry.
Mr. Kane?
Mrs. Kane would like to see you, sir.
Marie has been packing her since morning.
Tell Arnold I'm ready, Marie. Tell him he can get the bags.
Yes, madame.
Have you gone completely crazy?
Don't you know that our guests, that everyone will know about this?
Packed your bag, sent for the car--
And left you? Of course they'll hear.
I'm not saying goodbye, except to you.
But I never imagined people wouldn't know.
I won't let you go.
Goodbye, Charlie.
Susan.
Please don't go.
Please, Susan.
From now on, everything will be exactly the way you want it to be.
Not the way I think you want it but your way.
You mustn't go.
You can't do this to me.
I see.
It's you that this is being done to.
It's not me at all.
Not what it means to me.
I can't do this to you?
Oh, yes, I can.
In case you haven't heard, I lost all my money and it was plenty.
The last 10 years have been difficult for many.
They haven't been tough on me. I just lost all my money.
You're going down to Xanadu?
Monday, with boys from the office.
Mr. Rawlston wants the whole place photographed.
We run a picture magazine.
If you're smart, you'll get in touch with Raymond. He's the butler.
You'll learn a lot from him.
He knows where all the bodies are buried.
You know, all the same, I feel kind of sorry for Mr. Kane.
Don't you think I do?
What do you know, it's morning already.
Come around and tell me the story of your life sometime.
Rosebud?
I'll tell you about Rosebud.
How much is it worth to you?
A thousand dollars?
Okay.
Well, I'll tell you, Mr. Thompson.
He acted funny sometimes, you know?
No, I didn't.
Yes, he did crazy things sometimes.
I've been working for him 11 years now in charge of the whole place, so I ought to know.
Rosebud.
Yes.
Like I tell you, the old man acted kind of funny sometimes...
...but I knew how to handle him--
Need a lot of service?
Yeah. But I knew how to handle him.
Like that time his wife left.
Rosebud.
I see.
And that's what you know about Rosebud?
Yeah.
I heard him say it that other time too.
He just said: "Rosebud".
Then he dropped the glass ball and it broke on the floor.
He didn't say anything after that, and I knew he was dead.
He said all kinds of things that didn't mean anything.
Sentimental fellow, aren't you? - Hmm...
Yes and no.
That isn't worth $1000.
You can keep on asking questions if you want to.
We're leaving tonight when we're through taking pictures.
Allow yourself plenty of time.
The train stops at the junction on signal, but they don't like to wait.
I can remember when they'd wait all day if Mr. Kane said so.
Better get going.
Take a picture of that.
Can we come down?
Yes, hurry up. We're leaving.
How much do you think all this is worth, Mr. Thompson?
Millions.
If anybody wants it.
Well, at least he brought all this stuff to America.
What's that?
Another Venus. 25,000 bucks. A lot of money to pay for a dame without a head.
The banks are out of luck?
They'll clear all right.
He never threw anything away.
Welcome home, Mr. Kane, from 467 employees of the New York Inquirer".
One stove from the estate of Mary Kane, Little Salem, Colorado. Value: $2".
We're supposed to get everything, junk as well as art.
He sure liked to collect things.
Anything and everything.
A regular crow, eh?
Hey, look, a jigsaw puzzle.
We got a lot of those.
A Burmese temple and three Spanish ceilings down the hall.
Part of a Scotch castle that needs to be unwrapped.
Put all this stuff together:
The palaces and the paintings, and the toys and everything.
What would it spell?
Charles Foster Kane?
Or Rosebud. - How about it, Jerry?
What's Rosebud?
That's what he said when he died.
Did you ever find out what it means?
No, I didn't.
What did you find out about him?
Not much, really.
We'd better get started.
What have you been doing all this time?
Playing with a jigsaw puzzle.
If you'd discovered what Rosebud meant, I bet it would've explained everything.
No, I don't think so.
No.
He was a man who got everything he wanted, and then lost it.
Maybe Rosebud was something he couldn't get or something he lost.
It wouldn't have explained anything.
I don't think any word can explain a man's life. No.
I guess Rosebud is just a piece in a jigsaw puzzle.
A missing piece.
Well we'll miss the train.
Throw that junk in.
Through the snow and sleet and hail, through the blizzard, through the gales, through the wind and through the rain, over mountain, over plain, through the blinding lightning flash, and the mighty thunder crash,
ever faithful, ever true, nothing stops him, he'll get through.
Look out for Mr Stork That persevering chap
He'll come along and drop a bundle in your lap
You may be poor or rich It doesn't matter which
Millionaires, they get theirs like the butcher and the baker
So look out for Mr Stork and let me tell you, friend
Don't try to get away He'll find you in the end
He'll spot you out in China or he'll fly to County Cork
So, you better look out for Mr Stork
Look out for Mr Stork He's got you on his list
And when he comes around it's useless to resist
Remember those quintuplets and the woman in the shoe
Maybe he's got his eye on you
All aboard! All aboard!
All aboard!
Let's go!
Casey Junior's comin' down the track
Comin' down the track with a smoky stack
Hear him puffin' comin' round the hill
Casey's here to thrill every Jack and Jill
Every time his funny little whistle sounds
Everybody hurries to the circus grounds
Time for lemonade and Cracker Jack
Casey Junior's back Casey Junior's back
My, my.
Now, let me see.
Must be right around here somewhere.
I hope.
Watch it there.
...on the treetop
Where are we? Oh, here.
Highway 61, four miles to the gas station, turn left
That must be it.
Well, little fella, let's get going.
Mrs Jumbo.
Oh, Mrs Jumbo!
Calling Mrs Jumbo.
Mrs Jumbo?
Mrs Jumbo!
Oh, where's that Mrs Jumbo?
This way, boy.
In here, in here!
This is the place.
At last.
Which one of you ladies is expecting?
Not me.
The very idea!
Certainly not!
Over there.
Of course. - Yes, of course.
Right over there.
Of course.
Here is a baby with eyes of blue, straight from heaven right to you. "
Or...
Straight from heaven, up above, here is a baby for you to love. "
Sign here, please.
Yeah, well... Oh, Mrs Jumbo...
One moment, please.
This is still part of the service.
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday, dear...
Dear...
Dear me, what's his name?
Jumbo... Junior.
Oh, Jumbo Junior, huh? Jumbo Junior.
Happy birthday, dear Jumbo Junior
Happy birthday
To
You
Do hurry, dear.
I'm on pins and needles.
Isn't it thrilling?
I'm all aflutter.
Oh, this is a proud, proud day.
Hurry and open it, dearie.
I'm just dying to see.
Look at him. - Look at him.
Oh, you sweet little thing.
He is cute, isn't he? - Oh, he is a darling little angel.
Adorable. Simply adorable.
Did you ever see anything so cunning?
Isn't he a darling?
Is it possible?
Isn't there some mistake?
Just look at those E-A-R-S.
Those what?
Oh, ears!
These! Aren't they funny?
My, what a temper. What did I do?
Tell me, did I say anything?
A perfectly harmless remark.
I just said they're funny.
They certainly are.
After all, who cares about her precious little Jumbo?
Jumbo?
You mean Dumbo!
Dumbo!
That's good.
I think I can, I think I can. I think I can, I think I can.
I think I can, I think I can.
I think I can.
I... thought I could, I thought I could. I thought I could, I thought I could.

Hey, guys, look-it, Skinny's an elephant.
You can't hide him.
His ears are still sticking out.
Come on. - Let's see him.
We want a laugh.

My dear, can you bear it?
When she doused the ringmaster, I just thought I'd die.
Well, personally, I think she went a bit too far.
After all, one mustn't forget one is a lady.
You're right, dear.
Well, I suppose that's mother love.
It's no excuse for what she did.
Mother love might cover a multitude of sins.
A guy can't eat in peace.
Gab, gab, gab.
Always gossiping.
Girls, girls! Listen!
Have I got a trunkful of dirt.
Darling, tell us. - Go on!
Well, I heard today that they have put her in solitary confinement.
No!
You don't mean it!
How awful for her.
Well, I must say, I don't blame her for anything.
You're absolutely right.
It's all the fault of that little F-R-E-A-K.
Yes, him with those ears that only a mother could love.
What's the matter with his ears?
I don't see nothin' wrong with 'em.
I think they're cute.
Ladies, ladies!
It's no laughing matter at all.
She's right, girls.
Don't forget that we elephants have always walked with dignity.
His disgrace is our own shame.
That's true.
Indeed, it is.
Well, frankly, I wouldn't eat at the same bale of hay with him. - Nor I.
Me either, dearie. - I should say so.
That's just how I feel about it.
Here he comes now.
Pretend you don't see him.
How do you like that?
Givin' him the cold shoulder.
Poor little guy.
There he goes, without a friend in the world.
Nobody to turn to.
I'll do something about this.
A mouse!
You like to pick on little guys?
Why don't you pick on me?
A proud race.
Overstuffed hay bags.
Still afraid of a mouse!
Boy, wait till I tell the little guy.
Where is he?
Hey, Dumbo.
You can come out now.
Golly, maybe I scared him too.
Look, Dumbo, I'm your friend.
Come on out, won't you?
You're not really afraid of little me, are you?
You are?
I must have overdid it in there.
I don't know my own strength sometimes.
Dumbo, look what I got for you.
You gotta come out first.
Too bad you don't trust me.
'Cause I thought you and me, we might get your mother out of the clink.
But I guess you wouldn't be interested.
So long, Dumbo.
Well, that's more like it.
You know, your ma ain't crazy.
She's just broken-hearted.
It ain't nobody's fault you got them big ears.
I stepped in it that time.
Gee, Dumbo. I think your ears are beautiful.
Sure. As a matter of fact, I think they're very decorative.
You know, lots of people with big ears are famous.
All we gotta do is build an act.
Make you a star!
A headliner!
Dumbo the Great!
The great what?
You know, Dumbo, we gotta get an idea.
Not just any idea, something colossal. - Like...
Have I got an idea!
What an idea!
He never had an idea in his life.
Just visualise.
One elephant climbs up on top of another elephant, until, finally, all 17 elephants have constructed an enormous pyramid of pachyderms.
I step out. I blow the whistle.
The trumpets are trumpeting. - Yeah. - And now...
Yeah? What is the climax?
I don't know.
I knew he never had nothin'.
Well, maybe it comes to me in a vision while I dream.
Good night, Joe.
Good night, boss.
Climax?
Climax!
Dumbo, you're a climax.
I'll be back in a minute.
I'm gonna take care of your future.
I am the voice of your subconscious mind.
Your inspiration.
Now, concentrate.
Remember, your pyramid of elephants are in the ring,
waiting for a climax.
You are now getting that climax. - Climax.
How's the reception? Coming through OK?
Good.
Suddenly, from the sidelines comes your climax.
Galloping across the arena, he jumps from a springboard to a platform at the very pinnacle of your pyramid.
He waves a flag for a glorious finish.
And who is your climax?
The elephant with the big ears.
The world's mightiest midget mastodon,
Dumbo!
Dumbo.
Dumbo...
Dumbo.
Dumbo!
I got it!
I got it!
Ladies and gentlemen, we will now present for your entertainment the most stupendous, magnificent, super-colossaI spectacle!
On this tiny, little, insignificant ball, we will construct for you a pyramid, not of wood, not of stone...
To hear him talk, you'd think he was going to do it.
... a living, breathing pyramid...
The stuffed shirt.
...of ponderous, pulsating, pulchritudinous pachyderms.
I give you the elephants.
Aren't we a bit clumsy?
Gaining a little weight, aren't you, honey?
You're no cream puff yourself, dearie.
Quiet up there.
Tend to your work, girls.
Take your foot out of my eye. Clumsy ox.
Steady, girls.
Boy, that was a close one.
They're almost ready now, Dumbo.
Don't forget to wave that flag.
OK, OK. Don't wave it no more. I saw you.
Now look, all you gotta do is run out, jump on the springboard.
All right. Now show me just how you're gonna do it.
That's it. Thattaboy. That's the stuff.
Oh, Dumbo!
Oh, those ears. We got to do something, quick.
Ladies and gentlemen, you have now seen the impossible accomplished in front of your faces.
Seven jungle giants, each one weighing not one ounce less...
That windbag.
Why doesn't he come to the point?
...pounds.
And now I present the world's smallest little elephant, who will spring from this springboard, in one spring, to the top of this pyramid, waving his little flag for a grand climax.
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you... Dumbo.
Go on! Get going.
What's the matter with you?
Dumbo, that's your cue. You're on, Dumbo.
Out of my way, assassin.
I never thought I'd live to see the big top fall.
Because of that Dumbo, I never can show my face there again.
Look at my beautiful taiI.
I'd just like to spank the daylights out of him.
That won't be necessary, dearie.
They fixed him good.
What do you mean?
What did they do? - Did they beat him?
What is it? - Tell us.
Come, come, I demand to know.
Oh, well, they've gone and made him...
Made him a clown.
A clown? !
No!
Yes.
Oh, the shame of it.
Let us take the solemn vow.
From now on, he is no longer an elephant.
Mr Fireman, save my poor baby!
Save my child!
Save my baby!
Come on, jump.
We'll save ya! Hurry up.
We'll save you.
Come on, jump.
Jump!
Boy, did we wow 'em out there.
What a performance.
We're good. Thirteen curtain calls! Thirteen!
It sure brought down the house, all right.
Mama, did we panic 'em.
Ask me.
You said it, we rolled them in the aisles.
Boy, what an act.
What an act is right.
Stupendous, I calls it.
They'll have respect for clowns now.
Yeah, you bet.
Boys, this calls for a real celebration.
Come and get it.
Am I thirsty!
I could use one of them.
This one's on Dumbo.
Yeah, Dumbo.
See? They're drinking a toast to you.
Yeah, you're a big hit.
You're terrific.
You're colossal, stupendous.
Come on, alley-oop. I gotta wash behind your ears.
You ought to be proud.
You're a success.
Look! A peanut.
Come on, eat it. It's got lots of vitamins.
It'll give you a lot of... pep.
I forgot to tell you, we're going to see your mother.
I made an appointment.
Didn't I tell you?
Just like me.
I must have forgot. Come on, get your hat.
Right over there.
Cosy little place, ain't it?
Mrs Jumbo.
I hope she's in.
Someone to see you.
Baby mine, don't you cry
Baby mine, dry your eye
Rest your head close to my heart
Never to part, baby of mine
Little one, when you play
Don't you mind what they say
Let those eyes sparkle and shine
Never a tear, baby of mine
From your head to your toes
You're so sweet, goodness knows
You are so precious to me
Cute as can be, baby of mine
Baby mine
There you are. Pour it in me slipper, Joey.
Boy, I can't get over the way we rolled them in the aisles.
Wait till we hit the big top.
This gives me an idea.
Raise the platform the elephant jumps off of.
If they laugh when he jumps 20 feet, they'll laugh twice as hard if he jumps 40 feet.
Yeah, that's right.
Simple mathematics.
Let's make it 80 feet.
Don't be a piker.
Hundred and eighty.
Make it 300.
A thousand.
Yeah, that's good.
Be careful. You'll hurt the little guy.
Go on. Elephants ain't got no feelings.
They're made of rubber.
This idea's sensational.
Let's go tell the boss.
Yeah, let's go!
Hey, let's hit him for a raise.
Yeah, sure! This is worth real dough.
Oh, we're gonna hit the big boss for a raise
Yes, we're gonna hit the big boss for a raise
Oh, we're gonna get more money 'cause we know that we're funny
We're gonna hit the big boss for a raise
I know how you feel, Dumbo.
But you gotta pull yourself together.
What would your mother think of you if she saw you crying like this?
Remember, you come of a proud race.
You're a...
A pachyderm.
And pachyderms don't cry.
What's crying get you, anyhow?
Nothin' but the hiccups.
There. You see?
Well, ain't nothing a little water won't cure.
Upsadaisy.
We'll have you fixed up in a jiffy.
Come on.
Here. Take a trunkful.
Listen, little fella, we may have had a lot of hard luck up till now, but you and me is gonna do big things together.
Hold your breath.
Why, your mother's gonna be so proud of you.
I'm gonna be proud of you too.
The circus is gonna be proud of you.
Now, what do you think of that?
Swallow it.
They can't keep us down.
I guess you had one little one left over.
We'll bounce back so hard...
Hey, what's the matter with you?
What kind of water is this, anyhow?
Balloonies.
Hiya, George.
That's a pretty "strick shlick".
All right. Let's see you blow a square one, paI.
Say, that's very, very clever.
Now blow a great big one.
It's a pretty... Hey!
Dumbo!
Do you see what I see?
Look out Look out Pink elephants on parade
Here they come, hippity-hoppity They're here and there Pink elephants everywhere
Look out Look out
They're walking around the bed
On their head, clippity-cloppity
Arrayed in braid Pink elephants on parade
What'll I do?
What'll I do?
What an unusual view
I can stand the sight of worms and look at microscopic germs
But Technicolor pachyderms is really too much for me
I am not the type to faint when things are odd or things are quaint
But seein' things you know that ain't can certainly give you an awful fright
What a sight - Chase them away
Chase them away I'm afraid, need your aid
Pink elephants on parade
Pink elephants
Well, looky here.
My, my.
Why, this is most irregular.
Well, I just can't believe my eyes.
They ain't dead, is they?
No, dead people don't snore.
Or do they?
What's all the ruckus?
Come on, step aside, brother.
What's cookin' around here?
What's the good news?
What's frying?
Just look down there, brother.
And prepare yourself for a shock.
Well, hush my beak.
Go ahead, wake them up, brother.
Yeah, find out what they're doing.
Yeah. - Ask them what they want.
OK, boys, leave it to me.
Those pink elephants!
Pink elephants!
What's so funny?
What are you boys doing down here?
What are we doing down here?
Well, hear him talk.
Fly up a tree, where you belong.
Say, look here, brother rat.
Brother rat!
Listen, I ain't your brother, and I ain't no rat!
See? And I suppose you and no elephant ain't up in no tree either!
No!
Me in no tree and I'm no...
Tree?
Dumbo.
Wake up, Dumbo!
Don't look now, but I think we're up in a tree.
Don't pay attention to them scarecrows.
Come on, Dumbo.
Let's get back to the circus.
So long, boy.
But I wonder how we ever got up in that tree anyway.
Now, let's see.
Elephants can't climb trees, can they?
No, that's ridiculous.
Couldn't jump up.
It's too high.
Hey there, son. Maybe you all flew up.
Maybe we flew up. Yeah, maybe we...
That's it!
Dumbo, you flew!
Am I stupid.
Why didn't I think of this before?
Your ears. Just look at them, Dumbo.
They're perfect wings.
The very things that held you down are gonna carry you up and up and up!
I can see it all now.
Dumbo, the ninth wonder of the universe!
The world's only flying elephant.
Did you ever see an elephant fly?
Well, I've seen a horsefly.
And I've seen a dragonfly.
I seen a housefly.
I've seen all that too.
I seen a peanut stand
And heard a rubber band
I seen a needle that winked its eye
But I be done seen about everything
When I see a elephant fly
What you say, boy?
I said, when I see a elephant fly
I seen a front porch swing Heard a diamond ring
I seen a polka-dot railroad tie
But I be done seen about everything
When I see a elephant fly
I saw a clothes horse a- rear up and buck
And they tell me that a man made a vegetable truck
I didn't see that, I only heard
Just to be sociable, I'll take your word
I heard a fireside chat
I saw a baseball bat
I just laughed till I thought I'd die
But I be done seen about everything
When I see a elephant fly
But I be done seen about everything
When I see a elephant fly
When I see a elephant Fly
All right, you wise birds.
This has gone far enough!
Quiet, gentlemen.
The Reverend Rodent is gonna address you.
You ought to be ashamed of yourselves.
A bunch of big guys like you, picking on a poor little orphan like him.
Suppose you was torn away from your mother when you was just a baby.
Nobody to tuck you in at nights.
No warm, soft, caressing trunk to snuzzle into.
How would you like to be left out alone in a cold, cruel, heartless world?
And why? I ask you, why?
Just because he's got those big ears, they call him a freak.
The laughingstock of the circus.
Then when his mother tried to protect him, they threw her into the clink.
And on top of that, they made him a clown.
Socially, he's washed up.
But what's the use of talking to you cold-hearted birds?
Go ahead, have your fun.
Laugh at him.
Kick him now that he's down.
Go on!
We don't care.
Come on, Dumbo.
Hey, brother, wait a minute.
Don't go away feeling like that.
We done seen the light.
You boys is OK.
Please. You've done enough.
But we's all fixing' to help you.
Ain't that the truth, boys?
Yeah, that's right.
You want to make the elephant fly, don't you?
Well, you gotta use a lot of "cology".
You know, psychology.
Here's what you do. First you...
Then, right after that, you...
Use the magic feather.
Catch on?
The magic feather!
Yeah. I got you.
Dumbo, look!
Have I got it! The magic feather.
Now you can fly!
Let's go. Let's go. - Heave-ho.
Let's go, Dumbo.
Let's go. Let's go. - Come on, now.
Up, down! Up, down! - Heave-ho.
Faster! Get up flying speed!
Retract your landing gear.
Raise your fuselage. Take off!
It's no use.
I guess it's just another one of their... Look!
Hot diggety! You're flying!
You're flying!
Why, he flies just like an eagle.
Better than an airplane!
Well, now I've seen everything.
Well, I've clean done seen about everything
When I see a elephant fly
With the wind
When I see an elephant Fly
Dumbo, I knew you could do it!
Wait till we get to the big town!
Boy, them city folks is sure in for a surprise!
My baby!
Come on, jump.
Jump!
Look at that house.
Dumbo, you're standing on the threshold of success.
Don't look down. It'll make you dizzy.
Boy, are they in for a surprise.
Got the magic feather?
Good.
OK. Contact!
Take off!
The magic feather!
Dumbo!
Come on, fly!
Open them ears!
The magic feather was just a gag.
You can fly!
Honest, you can.
Hurry, open them up!
Please!
We did it!
We did it!
Let's show 'em, Dumbo! Power dive!
Now, loop the loop.
You're making history!
I seen a peanut stand Heard a rubber band
I seen a needle that winked its eye
But I be done seen about everything
When I seen a elephant fly
When I see
When I see an elephant fly
Look at him go!
When I see an elephant fly
Happy landing, son!
When I see an elephant fly
I wish I'd have got his autograph.
Man, I got his autograph.
So long, glamour boy.
I see a long, straight line athwart a continent
No chain of forts or deep-flowing river or mountain range but a line drawn by men upon a map nearly a century ago accepted with a handshake and kept ever since a boundary which divides two nations yet marks their friendly meeting ground
The 49th parallel— the only undefended frontier in the world

Hang on, boy.
Stop!
Where's your captain?
The old man's dead.
He went down to the cabin to get the ship's papers. He must've got caught when she rolled.

Jackie's dead too, isn't he?
Yes.

If you say so.

Half speed ahead

Here come the boys! Give 'em a cheer!
Only a fool would imagine we could raid enemy ships for supplies now.
Outgoing ships will be detained, incoming ships heavily convoyed... at least for the next few days.
We must find a spot where the enemy is least likely to seek us out... which is not being patrolled every day... where they'll never think of looking for us.
Hudson Bay.
Too many damned icebergs about.
What's our position?
Three miles off Point Amour.
If we go up, we risk the patrols, but we'll make better time.
If we stay below, we risk the ship.
I'm going up.
Action stations!
Where are we?

Yes. Then you can pick a landing party, clean ship I'll give you 12 hours
Canada.
Leutnant Hirth, you have your orders.
Leutnant Kuhnecke, you are second in command
You are taking one day's rations with you—not more
Your mission is to bring back food and fuel.
Over that hill you will find a Hudson's Bay trading post.
If the men there are armed and are foolish enough to offer resistance... you will destroy them
Jahner!
Take this flag.
As soon as the post is captured, you will hoist it and I shall bring the ship in.
Do not forget, you are the first of the German forces to set foot on Canadian soil — the first of many thousands
Be worthy of that high honor Acquit yourselves like men and Germans
Each of you, in the fulfillment ofhis duty is helping to bring about the completion of our führer's great plan

Somebody's fond of potatoes around here.

This one, boss.
Very dirty boss. Him no take bath one whole year, Johnnie.
I know that voice.
Johnnie!
Albert!
You old walrus! By golly, it's dandy to see you!
When did you get in?
One half hour ago.
I find the water on the stove and the dinner cooking and I say... "Johnnie, you're in luck, mon vieux Your friend Albert is expect you!"
What do you think of my whiskers?
She is dandy, huh? - Oh, manor grand!
Give me a scissor and your razor quick!
I cut 'em! Oh, sure, Johnnie.
I'm hopin' you're gonna stay for a while this time.
Sure thing.
I stay till the boat come. And wait till you see my skins. I had the best year I never had.
And now I'm gonna get so busy doing nothing.
Yes, sir, I'm gonna do nothing like she's never been done before.
Hello, Winnipeg Hello, Winnipeg
This is Wolstenholme calling Wolstenholme calling
This message to be sent on to Three Rivers
Trois Rivieres, Quebec TrapperJohnnie Barras is anxious to send a message... to his father, Napoleon Barras of, eh —
Oh, hold on a minute Wait a minute Wait a minute
All right, here ya are
Of, eh, 32 Rue Crevisse
And his mother, and his eight sisters and six brothers — to tell 'em that he's arrived safely this evening at Wolstenholme Post... after a successful 11 months hunting and trapping.
He says thanks for sending on last year's mail and the rosary
A - And the cake that kept very well in its airtight tin
And he says send on another one
Go on, Winnipeg
Hudson Bay House, Winnipeg, speaking.
Nice work, Johnnie! This is Ed speaking.
Hiya! Good night, Wolstenholme. Good night.
Good night, Winnipeg.
Good night.
Ship time at Rangnirtung" Say, where the ship?
I've been answering that question till I'm fair sick and tired of it.
Not a soul comes through this post that doesn't ask it, huskies and all.
Where's the ship, boss?
Where's the ship?"
Bien, alors, where is ship?
Behind the hill!
Ah, oui Bien sûr
Come on.
Well, what's the news from home, eh?
Some good, some bad. Everyone is well. That is good.
Business is slow. That is bad.
My father say it is because of them war rumors.
But he tell me no worry. This Hitler is only bluffing.
And he said they all say there will be no war this year or next year
You look to me as I go mad.
Of course, I was forgetting. You can't have seen a paper in over a year.
What do you mean?
Has it happened, then?
Sure it's happened. Bigger than the last.
Nom de dieu! - Who fighting?
Mostly everybody
Who starting first?
Oh, the Germans, of course. They marched in on the Poles in September 1939.
The Poles?
Sure.
Ma foi, I thought all the poles was in Canada!
No, no, Johnnie.
They've given Poland a terrible time.
Wiped out Warsaw.
And those poor refugees —You know, the women and children who tried to get away— they machine-gunned them down.
The Germans are ordinary men, same as you and me.
I wouldn't do a thing like that.
Would you? Well, you can't tell me they do. That's all newspaper talk to try and bring us in.
A wee bit late, Johnnie, my lad. We are in.
Canada, in the war?
Sure she is. Didn't you hear the bombing tonight?
Bombing? Was that bombing?
Sure. One of our planes went across. Maneuvering, I suppose.
So, Canada, she in the war.
Pas possible
Anyhow, you can't tell me French Canada got mixed in it too.
I certainly can.
Nom de dieu! They're in it just the same as everybody else
But that beat me!
I don't see what for French Canada had to go to defend a bunch of Poles!
I don't get that at all.
I don't see what that mean to us.
Anyhow, one kind government... much same like 'nother.
Yeah, you're right there. We're all the same.
Don't get you nowhere.
Anyhow, we needn't worry about it out here.
I guess all we got to do is just to do our jobs
That suit me.
What about a wee drink, Johnnie, eh?
Well, here's the skin off your nose.
And off yours too, you old walrus.
Ay-yi-yi. I won't sleep well tonight.
Never do first night in real bed.
I was just the same when I was trapping.
Oh, but you get used to it in a couple of nights.
Dogs are noisy tonight.
Seem like your and mine getting to know one 'other.
Aye, the wind is blowing up.
A regular Montreal concert.
Window!
Door! - Hey, what's the big idea?
Move out. - Johnnie!
Stay where you are.
Door locked, Herr Leutnant
No one else here?
Only this. - Search him. Kranz and Lohrmann, search the other two.
You've ammunition and rifles here.
Where are they?
They're in the cupboard.
Do not smash cupboard. Cupboard's not locked.
Where are the rifles?
Better tell him.
In the store.
Which is the store? Big building outside with the company sign.
Vogel.
Kranz. What sort of crook are you anyhow?
What's the game?
HaveyoupeopleinCanada not heard that there's a war on?
Sure we hear there war on!
You —
German. - Yes!
German! We are German!
Okay. Why yell about it?
Moi, j'ai compris You German.
I'm Canadian, he Canadian and he Canadian.
My father fight against you last time. We give you one good licking then, and we do it again.
Johnnie!
Don't any of you guy ever laugh?
The English tell us we've no sense of humor, which means simply that our humor is different from theirs.
Ah. I tell Nick. He appreciate that.
Nick?
My servant, who your man kick when he can't kick back.
The Eskimos are racially as low as Negroes.
What's the matter with Negroes?
They're semi-apes, only one degree above thejews.
Who says so?
Those are the führer's own words, from Mein Kampf
Ah, voyons! I make my living trapping animal.
But if I was meet half-ape, I wouldn't kick him in the stomach as you did that husky in there.
Please don't abuse our kindness. We're trying to be friendly, but you're making it difficult.
Okay, okay, okay.
Do you have to waste my batteries?
I want you to answer a few questions.
Let's hear them first.
What transportation have you with the outside world?
Transportation? I'll have to walk to the railway, or else wait for the boat.
When does the next boat arrive?
If the weather's good, she'll be here this July.
If the ice closes, it'll be theJuly after that.
I want the truth. - You callin' me a liar?
Yes.
You ask me to believe that you've only one ship a year?
Believe it or not, it's all the same to me, my wee man.
Where's the nearest railway?
Churchill.
Churchill.
And the nearest police post?
Aha! You'll soon find out!
Lake Harbor.
You seem to know all about it, eh?
What strength is it? - Uh, 30 men. Or is it 25, Albert?
Or two.
Where you get him?
How 'bout this for a map?
It makes ours look a bit out of date
Where'd you get it?
Did you ever meet a missionary called Malotte? - Malotte!
Sure! You remember him, Albert?
A flying missionary.
I mind him.
You remember that time his airplane was lost and all the people pray for his safety?
He was a good missionary.
He was one grand fellow. And an even better mapmaker.
Oh, so that was it.
The spying' blackguard.
I would never have believed it, a man of his cloth.
Oh, and good.
Good priest like Malotte too.
And a good German.
In a report from the far north, Cape Ross reports heavy slop ice from — 9
A-U-E calling C-Y-7-B.
9
A-U-E calling C-Y-7-B.
Come in, C-Y-7-B.
C
Y-7-B.
That's our call signal.
Who is it?
Oh, just a friend of mine.
An American from Grand Rapids, Michigan. - He plays chess with me.
Chess?
Sure, chess
Why?
To pass the time!
Ma foi! He don't often get such pleasant company here.
Board's over there on the table by the radio.
We play three nights a week.
But not tonight
First night we've missed in nearly two years.
9
A-U-E calling C-Y-7-B.
A-U-E C
Q-ing C-Y-7-B.
Hope everything's all right
Say, what's the matter, Mac?
Why don't you answer?
This is Russell speaking
Try again in 15 minutes. If still missing, will report to Winnipeg.
If still missing, will report to Winnipeg Standing by
What is he going to report?
That an accident might have happened to me.
He's got to do something about it.
Why Winnipeg? - It's the head office of our company.
What company?
The Hudson's Bay Company
Hirth.
Tell me, uh... do you really march around in Berlin doing this?
Yes.
Why?
I tell you, I know what I'm talking about
You always do, don't you?
We'renotin theshipnow The whole position's entirely different
You seem to forget that I'm a high party member, one of the first million in 1930.
You didn't even join till 1936. One of the first 70 million — that's you.
And I'm a practical man too. I'm not a dreamer, an idealist, like you.
It's all a question of experience.
I'm an engineer. I understand ships, radio, planes, and I understand human nature.
I tell you, I'm right, Hirth.
They must play chess! Our position is too dangerous to allow one of these men a free hand with the radio.
Free hand?
With my gun at the back of his head?
That makes no difference. Do you want that noisy American butting in and causing trouble?
He's going to notify Winnipeg. They'll have heard about our submarine being bombed, and they'll put two and two together.
I'm right, Hirth. They must play chess.
My move Pawn H-2 takes G-3 Pawn H-2 takes G-3 Standing by
I told you not to make that move
I know what I'm doing.
Watch me. WhyshouldIwatchyou, mayI ask ?
The game's lost
I haven't lost a game in two years
You haven't lost this one yet, have you?
Are you ready?
Aye, I'm ready.
Pawn B-7 to B-5.
Why did my wife have to go to a double feature the one night I had you on the run?
But you come to the wrong man.
I won't guide you to the railroad, me.
You never make it anyhow.
Why not?
This is one big country.
But very few people. Everyone know everybody.
You can't make a goose step through it without the police find out.
But no one has seen us.
Ah! Penses tu? Écoute
If one husky dog have the smell of you... his boss know from the way he howl... that there is stranger in district.
One Eskimo might find your track.
Maybe have.
Most likely that Eskimo is on his way to Mounted Police right now.
Perhaps, perhaps.
But you must help us.
After all, it's your own interest, now that your country has surrendered.
My country?
Surrender?
At 12:30 on the 17 th ofJune, 1940...
France laid down her arms.
France?
Ah! I'm Canadian!
Certainly. You are a French-Canadian.
But after the war, the führer intends to liberate your people from the British tyranny.
Comment? How?
French Canada will be free.
You will be free.
I am free!
Or, I was plenty free till you guys got in.
I mean the freedom of your people, an oppressed minority.
The freedom to speak their own language, to have their own schools and churches... to govern their own affairs.
Here you will find it written in the führer's own words.
Perhaps you've read it.
Uh, I have no room in my pack for any book.
I know my Bible. That's enough for me.
This is the Bible.
You must get a copy. It will explain everything to you as it has to me.
You better look up how to get out of Canada, then.
Maybe she don't tell you that, huh?
Maybe, uh, your führer ain't so smart as he think.
Don't he know that we French Canadians have always our own school?
And church.
And the right to speak as we want.
And run our own affair, by golly.
No doubt you have certain privileges, but I don't feel —
Let me ask you one question.
Well?
How about them, uh... Poles?
How 'bout the French?
Do you let them run their own affair?
That is different.
The whole new order in Europe —
Okay, okay. You said enough.
Hello! Hello! Russell speaking.
Say, my wife's just brought in an extra. The whole front page is covered with news about that submarine your flyers knocked off up there.
Tell him the headline reads "Nazi U-boat —"
Oh,Maude,quityellingand give me the paper I want to read it to them
HomerRussell,you'lldonosuchthing It's my story, and I stick to it
Don'tbeaheel Mac'll wanna hear about it
Then take a back seat and I'll read it. Hello!
Hello!
Is that you, Mac? This is Maude speaking.
It says the submarine was sunk right in your backyard I'll read it to you
Nazi U-boat sunk in Hudson Bay." That's the headline.
A German submarine believed to be the U-37 was destroyed in Hudson Bay
near Wolstenholme by Canadian coastal command patrol planes
According to an official report... "the squadron leader claimed that several direct hits by medium bombs...
were scored before the Nazis could submerge He circled the spot and found no signs of any survivors "
There's a whole lot more to it, but that's the gist of it - How come you didn't know about it?
Why didn't you tell us?
Get your rifles.
Come out.
You can't leave him there like that.
Dirty lot of murderers.
Vogel,seeif they've heard anything outside
Killers That's all you are
All quiet, Herr Leutnant
Good. Can't have heard the shot.
Johnnie?
Johnnie. Johnnie, my son.
It's nearly 1:00.
It'll be three, four hours before there's anybody about.
If anybody should come to the post, we'll see they don't get away.
Kranz, Lohrmann, get him into the other room.
What about the radio?
Dead. I wonder if that American in Michigan got anything.
Idiot!
Well, that should do it, Vogel, eh?
Yes, Herr Leutnant. - But if you were to—
Shut up!
Hear anything, Herr Leutnant?
I've got it!
Wake him up!
Herr Leutnant!
Jahner. - What is it?
Come on here!
Winnipeg Hudson's Bay Company They're sending a plane
What kind of a plane?
An emergency plane from Churchill!
It'll be here in three hours There's a police boat coming too, from Lake Harbor
Johnnie.
We've got to get out quickly
Unlesswecan get hold of that plane they're sending
The company's sending a plane.
Who can handle a plane?
I can.
Anyone else handle a plane?
No, Herr Leutnant - No, Herr Leutnant
You don't doubt that I have the experience.
How many flying hours?
Enough.
It'll have to be you then.
Lohrmann Vogel
What about our clothes?
We can't go like this.
You mean our uniforms?
Don't be a sentimental fool.
Can't expect to escape in these outfits.
You're right, for once.
Men, this is our one chance of escape. Our only one.
We must be ready for it. We must have new clothes, money, food, rifles, ammunition.
Where do you keep the money?
There is none. - Don't lie to me.
You sell things here. - Not for money.
Plenty of coats, Herr Leutnant
What's the trouble at the post?
What's happened to the factor?
Nothing happen at the post.
My son go to white man yesterday. No come back yet.
Anybody else at the post?
TrapperJohnnie. Stay one day.
I'm a German officer.
I warn you not to resist.
Run, Les!
Fire!
Kranz, stand guard!
Kuhnecke and Lohrmann, get the boats loaded.
Jahner!
Vogel! Report to me when ready!
Hey, you.
Give him some water. It's behind me.
You're a Christian, aren't you?
No, I'm not.
Rosary.
What's he trying to say?
He wants his rosary.
What's the good of that to him?
When —
When... we win... the war... we... send you... some... missionaries.
All ready, Herr Leutnant
Thanks, laddie
Contact!
I can't take off!
We're overloaded!
Throw something out!
That'll do!
Still no use!
Everything'll have to go! - Everything!
Throw out the rifles!
How low is the gas?
It's all right.
Are you sure we have enough?
Our maximum speed seems to be about 145 kilometers an hour.
A hundred and sixty.
Herr Leutnant, there's a note here.
Can't risk it.
Seems a shorter course.
Yes, but longer over the sea.
Some of the magnetic variations up here are as much as 40 degrees.
By taking 269 degrees... we can pick up the bush railway down the coast as far as Lake Winnipeg.
But we'll need 15 flying hours.
Do you hear?
I'm not deaf.
Well, have we enough gas, or haven't we?
Yes!
Are we out of gas?
Can't be!
Emergency tank. Had to switch over, that's all.
I suppose the emergency tank is full.
Of course.
When we filled up at Wolstenholme, did you check the emergency tank?
Did you check the emergency tank?
What difference does it make whether I checked it or not?
Well, did you or didn't you?
Very well then! No!
You've got us into a mess!
Don't shout at me!
I'm trying to take control!
We'll make a forced landing if we have to.
Forced landing?
What good is that to us? We're 200 kilometers from the border!
Well, I can't think of everything, can I?
I can't help it if I make a mistake sometimes!
Anyway, you're supposed to be in command! Why don't you handle the thing yourself?
I wish I could!
We're going to crash!
What should we do? - Nothing!
Hang on!
There's a lake ahead!
All right! I'm not blind!
Parachute!
We'll never make it!
Can't you lift her a little?
Leave me alone, can't you!
Any orders, Herr Leutnant?
No! Save yourselves, if you can!
Jump!
No!
Sit down!
Hold on tight, everybody.
That's better. Better.
Throw something out!
What? A cushion! Anything!
I can't see the surface! - What is —This isn't —
I can't see!
I can't see to land!
Out!
Out!
I'll get out, Herr Leutnant!
Vogel!
Vogel!
All right, Herr Leutnant!
Herr Leutnant! Herr Leutnant! Herr Leutnant!
He's dead.
So that's Kuhnecke.
Look out! It's a woman!
German
German?
The girl has a German newspaper.
Germans here?
Why not?
There are half a million of us in Canada.
Vogel, go speak to her. See what you can find out.
Don't try to be too clever. Keep as near to the truth as you can.
Hello
Hello.
That's a good-looking scarecrow
Mmm. Why, you're only a kid.
I thought you were much older in that getup.
I'm 16.
Are you looking for work?
Yes.
How did you know?
You don't look like a hobo.
Reaping started?
Just begun.
Are you on your own?
Oh, those.
Those are my pals. - All right
I thought they were your pals.
Why?
Seasonal workers always travel in gangs.
Well, these are my pals. - This is —
Anna.
Anna.
She's 16.
It isn't true. I shouldn't lie. I shall be 16 the day after tomorrow.
It's only a difference of two days.
Yes, but Peter says there's no difference at all between a small lie and a big lie.
Who is Peter?
Our leader
Oh, so you have a leader.
Yes A wonderful leader You'll meet him
Aren't you coming to the settlement?
There isn't another for eight miles.
I told her we were looking for work.
We should be glad to, but, uh, there are four of us.
Don't worry.
When 111 people sit down for supper, four more won't make any difference.
Did you say 111?
Thirty-nine brothers, 47 sisters and 25 children. Hmm.
What are you?
Mormons?
Mormons? No. Hutterites.
I didn't mean we were all one family.
We're only brothers and sisters in God.
Anna, more bread for our guests.
We're sorry about the bread.
Mmm. I know a bit about baking.
If you don't mind my saying so, you ought to get a new baker.
We had a good one, but he went to Small Springs.
Mmm. Better pay? Pay?
Oh, no one gets paid here.
Doesn't anyone get paid anything?
No.
Well, what do you work for, then?
Just your keep?
No. For us all.
What, all these people work for nothing?
Yeah.
What sort of work?
Whatever suits them best.
Well, what do you mean?
They don't choose themselves, do they?
Haven't you got a leader of the community?
Yes. There he is over there. Where?
Which is your leader?
There.
Third from the right.
Well, doesn't he tell the people what sort of job they've got to do? Oh, no.
We tell him what we want to do.
Then how can he be your leader?
How do you mean?
Well, anyone works at whatever job they like, then.
Yeah, that's right.
If somebody can make shoes, he makes shoes.
If he wants to be a blacksmith, he works in the forge.
If somebody feels he can preach, well, he preaches.
Well, what's your specialty?
I'm... the baker.
When you sell your stuff in Winnipeg, what happens to the money?
We buy new tractors, build houses, found new settlements.
We just founded a new one over at Small Springs.
And if someone leaves you and then wants to come back, don't you punish them?
Punish?
Yes. Don't you send them to a camp or something?
Camp? Why a camp?
No, we just take them back because our religion tells us to.
The Hutterite religion?
The Christian religion.
Is it one of your rules to sing like this?
We haven't any rules. We sing because we like to.
It's good for the digestion.
Well, good night. The leader will look after you.
Thank you.
What's the salute? The what?
Don't you give the leader a salute?
Good evening, friends. - Good evening.
On behalf of my friends and myself, I have to thank you for your kindness... in giving us food and shelter.
You're welcome.
I hear you come from up north in the woods, or down north, as we call it here.
Yes.
Just come out?
Last week.
Are you Germans?
I ask, are you Germans?
Yes.
Are you ashamed of it?
Of course not.
I'll show you where to sleep.
Thank you
Most of us are Germans
You may find some from the same part of the old country as yourselves
Anna, I thought you would have told them all about us.
We mostly discussed birthdays.
Well, it's quite an event with us, the 16th birthday.
It means that one has grown up at last. Come in, please.
This house belonged to Hugo Waldner... one of our brothers who has gone to the new settlement.
At Small Springs?
Yes.
You see, we are like bees.
If we get too many, we send out a swarm.
So the house is empty and at your service.
Good night.
Sleep well.
Good night
Hmm. That's what I call a busy girl.
It's nothing. I make 14 beds every night.
That's a lot of work.
We have a lot of men who have no mothers and who aren't married yet. - So somebody has to make their beds.
Quite right.
Two of you can sleep in here, and there are two more beds in the other room
Where do you sleep?
In Peter's house.
In Peter's house?
But I don't make the bed for him
Poor Peter. Why not?
Because he has a mother to look after him.
Haven't you a mother?
No. She was drowned.
Drowned?
In the sea.
When we left Germany... we went to England... because we had to wait until we got a permit to come to Canada.
We got our permit after war was declared.
Was your father with you? Wait a minute.
I want to hear about her mother.
Her ship was sunk.
Torpedoed?
I think so.
Don't you know?
Was there a big explosion?
Shut up, you two.
You and your questions.
Don't answer them, Anna
Oh, leave that.
Run along now.
I'll take her home.
All right, you take her.
Good night, Anna.
Good night.
Chins up.
Remember then, do nothing without orders
Discipline is more important now than ever
So far, luck has been with us
It's a great stroke of fortune being here at all
Do you think they are friendly, Herr Leutnant?
Friendly? Yes.
But you saw how their leader tried to draw us out.
Are you Germans?
Are you ashamed of being Germans?"
That in a country with which we are at war.
There can only be one answer to that. Our agents have done their work well.
Yes. This religion may be nothing but a cover.
I bet they sing the "Horst Wessel" song better than hymns.
We shall see that tomorrow.
Heil Hitler
Heil Hitler!
Shut the door.
Well, Vogel, who knows?
Perhaps one day the story of our adventures will all be written in a book
In a few years time, it may be the basis of compulsory lectures to the Hitler Youth.
The ships we sank, with women and children aboard... the lifeboats we shelled — mmm, we were good at that.
What we did to the Eskimos at the post... the unarmed men we shot in the back.
You forget, Vogel, we're at war.
We can't expect to win without the methods of total warfare.
Men, women and children — they're all our enemies and must be treated as such.
Did you never read what Bismarck said?
Leave them only their eyes to weep with."
Leave them only their eyes to weep with."
Did he say that?
Those were his actual words in the war of 1870
You should study Bismarck He was a great German
A great German.
You know, Vogel, I'm worried about you.
You're a good fellow, but you don't discipline yourself.
You give way to emotions That'll land you in trouble one of these days
Why don't you take an example from Kranz, a fine, soldierly fellow
You could be just as good a Nazi as he is if you tried.
Are you listening, Vogel?
Yes, Herr Leutnant.
Then think it over.
Yes, Herr Leutnant.
And get out of bed and turn out the light.
Yes, Herr Leutnant.
Vogel, I —
Herr Leutnant?
Either of you seen Vogel?
No, Herr Leutnant
Well, get dressed at once.
Good morning, friend.
Good morning.
He's asking for you.
Oh?
All right.
Well? Aren't you going?
Well, I can't go till I've got this lot ready.
What shall I tell him?
I'll be along in a minute.
Now,where'sthisnew baker I hear about, eh?
Now, that's what I call bread.
You'll have to teach David the trick
Trickorno trick, I could never make bread as good as that
Cheer up, David. It took me seven years.
Why ever did you want to give it up?
I didn't want to give it up. I had to. You see, we all had —
Peter! Just come and look at this bread!
Good morning, friend.
Mr. Vogel is the best baker we've had here in 15 years.
I can't imagine why his last boss let him go
Must have been crazy lfhe wasn't then, he is now
Congratulations, Vogel.
It was a good idea.
Round the barn!
What's the news in Winnipeg?
The market was good for geese. People are asking for Hutterite geese.
I don't like that, Andreas.
No?
For 300 years our brethren have wandered from place to place... from country to country... because of the jealousy of others.
This is a good country, Andreas.
I met Frau Habermann. - Yes?
Oh, her trial was on today, wasn't it?
Her husband and her eldest son, Eric, are to be interned. She is free.
Bad luck... just at harvest time.
It wasn't a good day for the trial.
Papers are full of stories about those Germans who landed from a U-boat down north.
They seem to have acted like wild beasts, killing and stealing.
What's Frau Habermann going to do?
I had a talk with her.
She needs help on the farm.
It'll be difficult.
We'll talk it over. Tell the others we'll have a meeting tonight, yes?
Air's heavy.
I'm afraid we're going to have a storm tonight.
Sorry. Sorry I'm late, Peter.
Barbarina, there's an electric storm playing all around us... frightening the animals and your chickens.
Move over, Philip. - What about you, Anna?
Andreas.
Huh? - One of our guests is speaking.
Eh? What? Oh!
We're discussing the Habermanns.
I was about to say... you have one clear choice.
Where there is a question of blood... where one is governed by the deepest of racial instincts... then every other consideration is swept aside.
Men like yourself— German, or of German ancestry— rise up with all the might and power of the great German people behind you conscious of the sacred duty that binds us all together... and in the knowledge that he who doesn't forget his people... will not by his people be forgotten.
There is a new wind blowing from the east... a great storm coming across the sea... a hurricane which will sweep aside all the old, outmoded ways oflife and mark the beginning of a new order, not only for Europe
but for the whole world
Let those beware who would have the temerity to stand in its way.
They will go down before its irresistible impulse... and be crushed out of existence!
But for those who accept the new order or those who perhaps belong to it already why need I use these parables of speech any longer?
I mean, all of you here tonight — yes, you, brothers —
I call you brothers and proudly acknowledge you as such.
You who formed a little stronghold of our people here in Canada... you will have your share of the happiness and prosperity... that is waiting for us all when the storm is over and the sun rises — that mighty sun —
which will give us everything we need in life
What sun are you talking about, friend?
I am talking of the greatest idea in history— supremacy of the Nordic race, the German people.
I am talking of the being whose name I am certain lives in every heart... whose name hangs on all our lips... whether we can shout it to the world or only whisper it in one another's ears.
Germans!
Brothers!
I ask you to join with me in paying homage to our glorious führer.
Heil Hitler!
I don't ask where you come from or what brought you here... although you've left us in no doubt as to your beliefs.
Someone has given you, no doubt deliberately... a completely false impression of us.
We are only one amongst many foreign settlements in Canada.
There are thousands of them in this part of the world.
And they have been founded, some recently, some 80 years ago... by people who left their homes in Europe because of famine... because of starvation... because of racial and political persecution... and some, like ourselves, because of their faith.
Some came only to find new land new boundaries, a new world
But all have found here in Canada... the security... the peace and tolerance and understanding... which, in Europe... it is your führer's pride to have stamped out.
You call us Germans
You call us brothers. Yes.
Most of us are Germans.
Our names are German. Our tongue is German. Our old handwritten books are in German script.
But we are not your brothers.
Our Germany is dead.
However hard this may be for some of us older people... it's a blessing for our children.
Our children grew up against new backgrounds, new horizons.
And they are free... free to grow up as children... free to run and to laugh without being forced into uniforms... without being forced to march up and down the streets... singing battle songs.
You talk about a new order in Europe.
The new order... where there will not be one corner... not a hole big enough for a mouse... where a decent man can breathe freely.
You think we hate you, but we don't
It is against our faith to hate.
We only hate the power of evil which is spreading over the world.
You and your Hitlerism... are like the microbes of some filthy disease... filled with a longing to multiply yourselves... until you destroy everything healthy in the world.
No.
We are not your brothers.
What do you want?
I am come to tell you that you can make your own beds.
I don't want to work for you.
That's all right, Anna Run along now
You're Nazis, aren't you?
Aren't you?
We're not allowed to hate anybody.
But I hate you.
I believed you'd escaped from an internment camp.
I should tell the police about you.
You killed my father... because he said your führer was the Antichrist.
You drowned my mother.
I hate you.
I hate you!
So you're going to tell the police about us, are you?
Little girls should be seen and not heard.
That will do.
What's the matter with you?
That will do!
Come along, Anna.
I'll take you home.
Herr Leutnant, we can't let them go.
I'd like to see what you're going to do about it.
Vogel!
Yes, Herr Leutnant
Have you forgotten who you are?
No, Herr Leutnant.
Let the girl go and shut the door.
I'll take her home, Herr Leutnant
Is that you, Anna?
Yes, Peter.
I brought Anna home.
She's all right.
We're going now, perhaps in a few minutes.
I only wanted to say that you've been kind and I like it here.
You like my bread, and I like the way you live.
Being with you has made me feel like it used to be at home.
I'd almost forgotten what it was like... baking bread, doing my real work.
That's how it used to be seven years ago before everything changed.
The life I've been living seems to have no sense in it now.
Well, I'd better go now.
Please don't go.
Are they still talking?
Hush, child. Go to sleep.
How can a man like you, Vogel —
I mean, you're a simple, good human being.
How can you get mixed up with such a lot of gangsters?
What can you do?
When you're a boy, you like playing soldiers.
When you're a young man, you can't get work unless you belong to them.
When you're an old man, you're anxious not to lose what you've got.
But there are thousands of men like you, Vogel... men who don't like the way things are going.
I suppose so.
I suppose they don't know themselves. I didn't know.
It's as if a blind man said he doesn't know the sun shines. - I suppose so.
Why don't you stay with us, Vogel?
Do you mean it?
Of course I mean it.
Even if you know who I am, where I come from—
I don't care who you are or where you come from.
I know you.
Thank you, Peter.
It will mean internment.
What's it matter?
I'll come back after the war.
This is your home.
Engine Room Artificer Vogel
You are under arrest
You are accused of desertion and treachery to the Third Reich.
In the absence of a properly constituted court
I assume authority as your superior officer and sentence you to death
Have you anything to say?
The sentence will be carried out immediately in the name of the führer.
Investigations by the R.C.M. P... have resulted in finding the remains of a Canadian Airways sea plane... similar to the one stolen by the five Nazis at Wolstenholme
Give me the glasses.
What for?
Food. - You can't eat them.
I can sell them.
They're his.
Come on, come on.
They belong to the fatherland.
It wouldn't let us starve, would it?
Congratulations, Lohrmann.
No field glass has ever had a better end.
We shall view the future better through these.
How much did he give you?
Seven dollars.
Well, what are you waiting for?
You saw what the bulletin said.
They're watching the border.
But they don't know there are only three of us. They still think there are five.
The police aren't fools. They'll find out soon enough.
If we're caught, it won't matter whether there are three or five or 10 of us.
We're going to change our plans. We're going to Vancouver.
Vancouver?
AJapanese ship leaves Vancouver in a month's time.
Is it far to Vancouver?
About 2,000 kilometers.
We can never get as far as that.
The führer has never admitted the word "can't." Neither should we.
Our one consideration must be how to get to —
Ham sandwich, sir - How to get home.
Doesn't matter how we do it, but we will get home.
That's how he works.
He says that it's Germany's destiny to rule Europe. Doesn't matter how she achieves that destiny, but she will achieve it.
He gave me this.
These Canadians give everything away.
The road west is plain enough. Follow the River Assiniboine for 50 miles.
Do we start now, Herr Leutnant?
No.
No, we sleep tonight in the railway station.
Tomorrow we'll catch a bus outside the city limits, then walk.
He wanted us to fly to Vancouver.
Said it would save a lot of time. - What did you say, Herr Leutnant?
I said we had plenty of time.
2,000 kilometers is plenty of kilometers.
Those are the Three Sisters Mountains.
We're in the park now Banff National Park Today's Indian Day.
It's the biggest crowd of the year.
There will be thousands of Indians. You should stop over and see it.
I have an appointment in Vancouver.
You say these three men were here?
Well, they were right here.
Can you describe them?
Well, let me see, now. - There's only one that I would remember right well.
Corporal.
Ladies and gentlemen.
Norman,I 'mgoingto use your mike to talk to the crowd Attention please.
The mounted police have reason to suspect that among this crowd are three enemies of this country
They are not ordinary aliens, escaped from Kananaskis Internment Camp.
They are survivors from a German submarine... the notorious U-37, which was sunk in Hudson Bay by our air force
These men are here in this courtyard
They may be standing right next to you
Each one of you, look closely at your neighbor.
These are descriptions of the three men.
One, who appears to be the leader... is a well-built man of medium height
He has very definite features, a commanding manner is clean-shaven, brown hair
He wears a blue suit and tan shoes and carries himself as ifhe'd been drilled
There is no very good description of the second man.
He is thin and inconspicuous in his manner He wears a suit of some light color and a hat tilted over his eyes
He may be carrying a bulky rucksack.
The third man is short and dark. He wears no hat. He has a tweed jacket and a bow tie.
He carries a parcel wrapped in oilcloth and tied with thick string.
He is described as being nervous in his manner.
I must ask all of you to stay exactly where you are... and not talk or move.
All of you, as citizens, can help to bring these men to justice.
Each one of you, look closely at your neighbor.
Remember, each one of these men has every reason to be afraid
They've already been responsible for the deaths of 11 defenseless people
Sooner or later, their nerves will crack
Look closely at your neighbor
Corporal, there's your man!
Herr Leutnant, it's a trail.
Hmm, come on then.
Lost?
That's a difficult trail on foot in those outfits.
You walked in from the lodge, I suppose
Yes.
Any plans?
Plans?
Well, it'll be dark in an hour.
The moon doesn't rise till 11:00.
A lot of grizzlies on that trail.
Grizzlies?
Grizzly bears Touchy beasts
You wouldn't like 'em.
And they wouldn't like you.
I see.
Ah, dinner.
You're just in time. George will be pleased.
Tricky things, aren't they?
The great thing is just to sit still.
On holiday here?
Yes, on holiday.
How do you find the lodge?
They used to do you a very good lobster thermidor with a red Bordeaux.
They still do you a lobster, but no more red Bordeaux.
A nuisance, isn't it?
Hmm? The war, I— Anyhow, up here in the Rockies the war seems so remote, one can't take it so seriously
Of course one knows one half of humanity is trying to wipe out the other half, but... up here among the mountains and the spruce forests... one sees it in perspective.
So that it — it seems almost unimportant.
You've chosen a very beautiful place for your holiday.
Yes, it is beautiful, isn't it?
Actually, I'm here to work... on a book.
Oh, so you're a novelist?
Well, I write books
My specialty is Indians This has been a hunting ground of theirs for generations
Then I — I suppose you were at Banff today.
For Indian Day? No, no, no.
That's just for tourists. Oh, I beg your pardon.
Ship ahoy!
Well, gentlemen. Welcome to my humble tepee.
Got two this time, George I'm improving
And tell Bob two more for dinner. Well.
It must be very pleasant roughing it up here in the mountains.
Yes, I rather like pigging it occasionally.
I hope you won't mind taking potluck with me.
Here, have a cigarette.
Ah, I see you're looking at my Picasso.
It's nice, isn't it?
How do you feel about Matisse?
I picked these up about a year ago, and I can't bear to be parted from them.
How do you like it, hmm?
Excellent.
I don't think you two are really interested in pictures.
Well, my motto is, wars may come and wars may go... but art goes on forever.
Ah, you like reading, don't you?
Have you seen Hemingway's latest?
Here. I'm going to show you one of my pets.
There. Thomas Mann, The Magic Mountain
This is the German edition.
This is wonderful stuff.
By the way, do you speak German?
Have you read this book?
Thomas Mann is very good, I believe.
I'm so sorry.
Of course, you'll want a bath after your long climb. I'm afraid I can only offer you a shower.
Come on. I'll show you the way.
Thank you very much, Mr. —
Scott.
Philip Armstrong Scott. Come on.
Philip Armstrong Scott.
Ah, hot water.
I feel completely confident tonight.
If we'd twice as far to go, I wouldn't worry now.
What could these weaklings ever do to us?
The man's country's at war and look at him.
I tell you, Lohrmann, they're rotten to the core. There's no fight in them.
They're soft and degenerate all through.
No, I'll have cold.
George, the fire's smoking
South-southeast by south
Ah, that's the ticket
Yes, I've discovered some rather amusing things during my researches.
Blackfoot tribal customs, for instance, closely resemble those... of a certain modern European tribe.
I'm gonna read you something about that.
Where are we?
From the earliest age, their small boys were trained in the arts of war...
which they considered to be the only pursuit worthy of a man.
But they preferred to attack by night, rather than by day
and wherever possible, to shoot the enemy in the back
Their smaller neighbors lived in constant danger from them.
They also believed in first terrorizing their opponent... by covering themselves in war paint and beating loudly on their tribal drums."
Well, doesn't that sound familiar to you?
Familiar?
I don't quite understand
Well, what price Goebbels, eh?
Very similar.
Yeah, you see, don't you?
And listen to this.
This is wonderful.
Come here, sit down.
Uh, oh, yes.
When a tribal leader really desired to drive a point home...
he used that most terrible of all public speaker's weapons:
Repetition... constant and unutterably wearisome repetition."
Old man Hitler himself.
What's wrong?
I think he found it a little warm in here.
I'm so sorry.
Well, rather stuffy in there, eh?
A little.
Lovely night, isn't it?
The moon's just out.
We're not the only ones up, I see.
The men, eh?
When do they go to bed?
Oh, pretty early as a rule.
They please themselves.
You must be rather tired yourself.
How about a nightcap before you turn in?
Thank you.
Yes.
Well. Interested?
Have a drink?
Well, happy dreams.
Okay
Ah, I thought you'd find it a bit chilly.
We're 6,000 feet up here, you know?
So you think you'll escape the war, Mr. Scott? - Hmm?
That's not a very nice way of putting it.
But you'll do your best to escape it.
Do you mean I'm —
I wonder if I am.
I don't think I'm a coward.
I've never really been in any great danger. I don't exactly know how I'd behave.
I can imagine how you'd behave.
I beg your pardon?
I said, "I can imagine how you'd behave."
Well, you are an extraordinary fellow. You're certainly frank.
So you despise my mode of life, eh?
Well, I'm getting some revelations tonight Maybe it'll do me good Maybe I'm becoming a little smug
I imagined you'd been thinking, "Here's a nice, decent sort of chap.
Invites me to dinner when he doesn't even know me
Amiable. Full of interesting conversation."
And instead of that, you think I'm —
Go on, what do you think I am?
This ought to be enlightening.
If you were a real man, you'd have struck me across the face when I suggested you were a coward.
Instead of which, you talk about it.
Well, why not?
I may write about the customs of red Indians 200 years ago... but I don't have to behave like one.
After all, we've been given reasoning powers and the gift of speech.
Why don't we use them instead of hitting each other?
Come on, have a cigarette.
I don't think you're even a coward.
I don't think you're a man at all. You must've had too much to drink.
You both better get to bed.
Is this gun loaded? Of course it's loaded.
Then put your hands up.
What do you mean? - It's quite plain.
Put them up.
Well, well, well. This is a new experience.
So I've been entertaining gangsters. Well, what do you want?
Money or what?
You don't believe we'd shoot you, do you?
Such a thing couldn't happen to Mr. Philip Armstrong Scott.
Anything unpleasant must be kept as far away as possible... as far as the war, 5,000 miles away.
Suppose I was to tell you that the war is right here in this tent?
I don't suppose you've heard of the U-boat that was sunk in Hudson Bay and the six Germans who escaped.
So that's who you are — Nazis.
Well, that explains everything.
Your arrogance, your stupidity, your bad manners —
Get over there by your books!
Oh, dear. Do I have to be tied up?
Excuse us, Mr. Scott.
We still employ savage, tribal methods. They get results.
The best thing that's happened to us is meeting you. You've put the heart back into us.
There are only two of us now.
Two out of six brave men. There are millions like us in Germany.
Any more of your sort here, you don't stand a chance of winning this war. We'll see to that.
Get the clothes out of there.
Well, they won't suit you. Not much there, I'm afraid.
Thirty-three dollars.
Do I get a receipt?
There's only one suit here You better have the overcoat
Interesting.
So far, I don't feel the least afraid.
No sign of trembling.
Pulse appears to be quite steady.
Mouth a bit dry perhaps.
Here.
Rifles.
Ah, you feel happier now, don't you?
Look out.
Wars may come and wars may go, but art goes on forever, eh?
Stop!
Thomas Mann.
Yes, I have read this book.
We kicked this swine out of the Reich years ago.
There's something else too
Blackfoot Tribal Customs" Think yourself lucky we don't burn you too.
Well, I never would've believed that grown-up men... could behave like spiteful little schoolboys.
Have I said something to annoy you?
Then, I forget, anything reasonable annoys you.
Open your mouth.
One question, please.
When Hitler's making a speech, just exactly what are your rea —
Damn them horses.
Stampeded again. - Maybe they got wind of something
Maybe a bear There.
This way.
Who's been leaving a saddle out here?
Confound it! Here's another one.
Boss must've gone crazy.
You've made a fine mess of things. You've roused the whole camp.
The horses were your idea.
I knew they'd give trouble.
You forget yourself, Lohrmann.
Save your breath, Hirth.
Hey, Bob!
They're gone down by the lake!
Hirth! Not that way!
Who are you talking to?
You're not my superior officer now.
Obey orders and follow me!
Come on, George.
Art! Art!
Where are you?
Here, Mr Scott!
On the trail
By the waterfall
Hurry!
Okay, boss Coming!
Bob!
Bob, Bob, Mr Scott wants you!
Okay!
What's happened, Boss? - A holdup.
Those two fellas —
No!
Yes. - Oh, there's one of them.
Good old George.
Right here!
Coming your way!
Where are you?
Looks like he's lost it. - Confound it.
He's got it, the old bloodhound.
Come on.
Where is he, George?
In the cave?
What are we waiting for? Let's get him
Which one of them two is it, Boss?
I don't know. Did you see, George?
All right, George?
I forgot to tell you, Art.
He's got my Colt, too.
See that hole?
That's gonna cost him seven bucks before I let the Mounties get him.
That means he's got four shots left.
All right, Bob I'll take over now
Okay, Boss, but I don't think you ought to take any—
Let me stay with you, Mr. Scott.
The papers say these men are killers.
Yes, the Canadian papers.
The Nazi papers call them heroes.
Two brave Nazis against 11 million Canadians. Say, Mr. Scott.
Mr. Scott.
Stop him
Two.
Three.
Four.
That's the lot.
Oh, it's you I hoped it was the other fellow
That's for Thomas Mann That's for Matisse
That's for Picasso
And that's for me
All right, you can fetch him out now.
You all right, Boss?
Well, you can't expect me to capture an armed Nazi without getting hurt a little. - Yet — - Here.
Let me have a look at that.
The boss has knocked him cold.
Well, he had a fair chance.
One armed superman... against one unarmed decadent democrat.
I wonder how Dr. Goebbels will explain that.
Leutnant Hirth
wherever you may be on the North American continent... "I hail you as the paladin of the Third Reich...
and the upholder of the honor of the great German people.
By express order of the führer himself... "you have today been invested with the iron cross, first class.
Heil Hitler."
Flash:
Lethbridge, Alberta. Mounted police pick up trail of escaping Nazi.
At Lethbridge Airport, Kenyon Field... "it's been established that a man resembling the wanted man...
Lieutenant Hirth, planed in yesterday on Trip 22 from Edmonton and Calgary "
The hearts of all sympathizers with the German cause go out to Leutnant Hirth
One man against 11 million. "They know that even now, the odds are not too heavy...
when the one man represents the might of the Third Reich... and the 11 million, a collapsing democracy."
Forty-eight hours have elapsed and still Lieutenant Ernst Hirth...
the only surviving Nazi from the U-37, is at large.
The whole world's eyes are on southern Ontario.
The question of the hour is: Where is Hirth?"
You'll be okay here. I'll let you know when you get to the falls.
Much obliged Say, what's your name?
Oh, forget it I haven't seen you and you haven't seen me
Hello You bummin'a ride?
Yes.
You needn't be afraid of me.
I won't split on you. I'm not afraid.
Looks like you got a nice private car. Have a cigarette.
Sit down.
Thank you.
Comin' from Toronto?
Yes.
Livin' there, maybe?
No.
Quite a place, Toronto. - I didn't see much of it.
Are you from the west?
Well, I've been there.
Vancouver?
Yes.
That must be a beautiful city, Vancouver.
I didn't stay there long either.
You don't stay long anywhere, do you?
Well, I travel about a good deal. Travel about.
That's a lot of fun.
When I was a kid, I had the big idea to see the whole of Canada.
But things don't work out the way you think.
I save a bit of money, and what do I do?
Put it in my pocket and start off down the road... my own boss, with the whole of Canada in front of me?
Not on your life.
I buy a bit of land up Beamsville way.
And that keeps me so busy, that's about all of Canada I see.
Have a shot of Ontario wine.
Catawba.
I send the grapes to the winery from my own farm. - Sherry-type.
Thank you.
Got a kick like a mule.
Where was I? Oh, yeah.
Sometimes I think I'll take a holiday.
But do I take a holiday?
Not a bit of it. I take a wife.
Say, were there any M.P.'s around while you've been here?
M.P.'s?
Military police.
Are you in trouble with the police?
Not exactly what you'd call trouble. I just don't wanna meet 'em, that's all.
Are you a soldier?
Well, that's a matter of opinion.
That's what I joined up to be.
The government said, "We want men to fight the Nazis. Join today." So I joined.
I figured they were in a hurry. That was 387 days ago.
Four divisions and a lot of drafts have gone overseas... and what's Number B-987642 doing?
Guardin' the Chippewa Canal.
Who'd wanna steal it anyway?
Well, I guess I better climb back into my battle rompers.
Do you think your government have treated you badly?
Well, what do you think?
I didn't enlist to play nursemaid
I enlisted to knock hell out of the Nazis.
I'm about as close to getting my hands on a Jerry now as I was at the beginning.
We don't eat so good
Holy mackinaw, beef, three times a day.
Haven't tasted parsnips since I joined the army. - I'm fond of parsnips, too.
Why are you afraid of the police?
Who's afraid of the police?
I just overstayed my leave eight days.
That is a serious offense in wartime.
Says who? My CO? - You're a deserter.
Deserter, my royal Canadian foot.
I'm just independent.
You're a deserter because you have a legitimate grievance against your democratic government.
Say, where did you pick up those five-gallon words? You have a good suit.
Sure, it's a good suit.
Paid 25 bucks for it two years ago.
And along comes that heel, Hitler
It's a very good suit.
It's a dandy suit
Just now, most of the boys are wearin' these.
Yes.
Well, I'm a son of a — - Stand up.
Put your hands up.
Stand over there.
Unless you're anxious to be shot, you won't move.
I'm perfectly ready to kill you or anyone else.
Yeah, I can see you are.
Fourteen drums of carbide. - Don't move.
Fourteen drums
Who's movin'?
Nine cans germicide. Okay.
Everything checks all right.
Okay, then seal her up.
Now look what you done.
I am a deserter now. - What do you mean?
They're taking us clear out of the country.
Out of the country?
Into the States. We're crossin' the border now.
Into America?
Heil Hitler.
You dirty Nazi. - Yes, I'm a Nazi.
Heil Hitler.
One of them off the U-boat.
Quite right, my friend.
In two minutes, I shall be across the border.
Once there were six of us. Now I represent them all.
Field Marshall Göring has said...
It doesn't matter as long as we have only one plane and one man left, so long as victory is ours." Do you hear that?
We've beaten these dirty democracies, these weaklings.
I tell you, we've something inside us... something beyond the dim, muddied minds of you in the democracies.
What do you know of the glorious, mystical ties ofblood and race that unite me with every German Aryan?
When I step on American soil, I shall not be alone.
Adolf Hitler and all the great German people will be with me It is not the Canadian people we're against.
It's your filthy government, the whole democratic system.
You don't like it any more than I do. You don't like the job they've given you.
You don't like the food.
You said so yourself. - Why, you spoon-fed louse.
I can grouse about the food and the C.O. And anything I blame please.
And that's more than you with your Gestapo and your storm troopers and your Aryan bourgeois. Aw, nuts.
What's the good of talkin' to you?
You can't even begin to understand democracy
We own the right to be fed up with anything we damn please... and say so out loud when we feel like it.
And when things go wrong, we can take it.
We can dish it out too.
Hey,Eddie Wait a minute Hold the door
Thanks.
Hey, Eddie - Yeah.
You check and I'll mark.
How about you checkin'and me marking', just for a change, huh?
Go on and wrestle some boxes. It'll be good for you. Yeah, sure, sure.
Hey.
Lady Godiva
Who are you two?
I'm Andrew Brock, Canadian Active Service Force.
You don't look it. And you?
We're on American territory? - Yes.
I am Ernst Hirth, a German citizen.
I demand to be taken to the nearest German consulate. Don't do it.
Send him back.
He's an escaping Nazi. He slugged me. That's my uniform.
Hey, this gun is loaded.
No.
By your American law, you must take me to my consul.
Is that right?
I'm afraid it is.
He's one of that gang off the German submarine, the U-37.
On the level?
I am Leutnant Hirth of the German Navy and also a German citizen.
And I demand —
You've got to send him back.
He's not just an escaping Nazi. He's important. The whole German nation is waiting to see if he can get away with it.
I know. I read the papers.
Hey, couldn't we sort of—You know?
You mean? - Yeah.
No.
By your own law, you must take me to my consul.
Sometimes I think we got too many laws.
Don't let him pull that law stuff!
You know better than that, soldier.
I'm a customs inspector. This is for the immigration department.
My job's inspecting and checking on freights and imports.
Listen, Captain. What would you do if he were an illegal shipment of... cheese?
Return him But he's a human being
At least he's a Nazi.
He's not on the manifest, is he? - What?
I said, "He's not on the manifest."
No.
No. - No, he's not.
The American law —
Aw, shut up.
I know the law
It says, "Imports are not admissible unless properly manifested "
I find two items not listed - How do you check?
Same way. Two unlisted items.
But your law refers to freight, not to persons.
This is a freight car, and you're freight.
Tell the engineer to return this car.
Okay.
Phone those Canucks and tell 'em it's coming with two items missing from the manifest
Tell 'em to either list 'em or take 'em off - Check.
Thanks, Colonel.
Thanks a million.
We've all got to do our duty, soldier.
I'll send your gun back to the Mounties.
Okay. I don't need it. I protest.
You cannot do this.
It's illegal.
Sonny boy, I've done it.
Hello, Macaulay?
It's Eddie speaking'. We're sendin' back car number 8772.
Gee, you guys are gettin' careless. There's two items not in the manifest.
Now, either list 'em or take 'em off.
Put 'em up, Nazi.
No, not that way. This way.
'Cause I'm not askin' for those pants.
I'm just takin' 'em.
I am packing my belongings in the shawl my mother used to wear to the market, and I am going from my valley.
And this time I shall never return.
I am leaving behind me my 50 years of memory.
Memory.
Strange that the mind will forget so much of what only this moment is passed, and yet hold clear and bright the memory of what happened years ago, of men and women long since dead.
Yet who shall say what is real and what is not?
Can I believe my friends all gone, when their voices are still a glory in my ears?
And I will stand to say no and no again, for they remain a living truth within my mind.
There is no fence nor hedge around time that is gone.
You can go back and have what you like of it, if you can remember.
So I can close my eyes on my valley as it is today and it is gone, and I see it as it was when I was a boy.
Green it was, and possessed of the plenty of the earth.
In all Wales, there was none so beautiful.
Everything I ever learnt as a small boy came from my father, and I never found anything he ever told me to be wrong or worthless.
The simple lessons he taught me are as sharp and clear in my mind as if I had heard them only yesterday.
In those days, the black slag, the waste of the coal pits, had only begun to cover the side of our hill, not yet enough to mar the countryside, nor blacken the beauty of our village.
For the colliery had only begun to poke its skinny black fingers through the green.
I can hear even now the voice of my sister Angharad.
Huw!
Angharad!
Coal miners were my father and all my brothers, and proud of their trade.
Gwilym Morgan, three pounds seven.
Thank you, sir.
Lanto Morgan, three pounds seven.
Ivor Morgan, three pounds seven.
Davy Morgan, two pounds five.
Owen Morgan, two pounds five.
Young Gwilym Morgan, one pound ten.
Someone would strike up a song, and the valley would ring with the sound of many voices.
For singing is in my people as sight is in the eye.
Then came the scrubbing, out in the back yard.
It was the duty of my sister Angharad to bring the buckets of hot water and cold, and I performed what little tasks I could as my father and brothers scrubbed the coal dust from their backs.
Most would come off them, but some would stay for life.
It is the honourable badge of the coal miner, and I envied it on my father and grown-up brothers.
Scrub and scrub, Mr Coal would lie there and laugh at you.
There was always a baron of beef or a shoulder or leg of lamb before my father.
There was never any talk while we were eating.
I never met anybody whose talk was better than good food.
My mother was always on the run, always the last to start her dinner, and the first to finish.
For if my father was the head of our house, my mother was its heart.
After the dishes had been washed, the box was brought to the table for the spending money to be handed out.
No one in our valley had ever seen a bank.
We kept our savings on the mantelpiece.
My father used to say that money was made to be spent, just as men spend their strength and brains in earning it, and as willingly.
But always with a purpose.
Thank you, Dadda.
Out of the house and across the street, as I had run a hundred times before.
Softly now, for respect for chapel was the first thing my father taught us.
Then straight to Mrs Tossal the Shop, for that toffee which you could chew for hours, it seems to me now.
And even after it had gone down, you could swallow and still find the taste of it hiding behind your tongue.
It is with me now, so many years later.
It makes me think of so much that was good that is gone.
It was on this afternoon that I first saw Bron
Bronwyn.
She had come over from the next valley for her first call on my father and mother.
Is this Gwilym Morgan's house?
You must be Huw.
Is that you, Bronwyn?
Yes.
There's lovely you are.
I think I fell in love with Bronwyn then.
Perhaps it is foolish to think a child could fall in love, but I am the child that was, and nobody knows how I felt, except only me.
I'm so proud for Ivor.
I'm the one to be proud.
You think well of our Ivor?
It seems only a few months since he was scratching around here like this one, with his mouth open.
This is Bronwyn, Huw, who's to be your sister.
We have met already.
Be careful of the basket.
There's shortcake in it.
This is not for you. You will have your time to come.
Bronwyn and Ivor were to be married by the new preacher, Mr Gruffydd, who had come from the university at Cardiff.
This was my first sight of him.
Good evening, Mr Morgan.
Yes, indeed, sir.
Excuse me.
Thank you.
Come now, boys.
Ivor, find Dai Griffiths and Idris John and bring them to Mr Evans' office.
Will we come with you? - No.
This is a matter for the older men. - Home to your mother. - But...
Leave it now, Davy.
Why aren't you washed?
We were waiting for you.
The cut is only a few shillings.
There will still be plenty for us.
A bit of supper now, is it, girl?
It is because they are not getting the old price for coal.
Come and wash now.
May we speak first, sir?
Yes.
They did not give you the real reason.
We've been expecting it since the ironworks at Dowlais closed down.
What have the ironworks to do with us?
The men from Dowlais will work for any wage, so all our wages must come down.
And this is only the beginning. Watch now.
They will cut us again and still again, until they have this as empty as their promises.
A good worker is worth good wages.
Not while there are three men for every job.
Why should the owners pay more if men will work for less?
Because the owners are not savages.
They are men too, like us.
Men, yes, but not like us.
Would they deal with you just now, sir, when you went to them?
Because they have power and we have none.
How will we get power, then?
From the air? - No. From a union of all the men.
Union, is it?
I never thought I'd hear my own sons talking socialist nonsense.
It's good sense.
Unless we stand together...
I've had enough of this talk.
Come and wash now.
Your good mother will be waiting.
Do you think I'll let them make you stand in the rain and not raise my hands to stop it?
Hush, Davy.
Who gave you permission to speak?
It is too important for silence.
They're trying to punish you because...
But what are we going to do about it?
You'll die of cold when it comes to snow.
Let us stand together and see how they act then.
Right.
The men will come out if we say the word.
All the pits are ready.
You'll not make me a plank for your politics.
I will not be the excuse for any strike.
But if they do that to the spokesman, what will they try and do to the men?
We will see. Be silent now.
Finish your supper.
Father...
Enough now.
But...
On with your work.
It is not enough.
Wait until you have permission to speak.
I will speak against injustice anywhere, with permission or without it.
Not in this house.
In this house and outside, sir.
Leave the table.
I will leave the house.
Tell your father you're sorry.
I'm with you.
We can find lodgings in the village.
Gwilym.
All of you, then?
For the last time, sit down, finish your supper. I will say no more.
We are not questioning your authority, sir.
But if manners prevent our speaking the truth, we will be without manners.
Get your clothes and go.
I'm going with them to look after them.
Hold your tongue.
Yes, my son, I know you are there.
The men have struck.
What does it mean, Mr Gruffydd?
It means that... something has gone out of this valley that may never be replaced.
Home to your father and mother, boy.
Twenty-two weeks the men were out as the strike moved into winter.
It was strange to go out into the street and find the men there in the daytime.
It had a feeling of fright in it.
And always the mood of the men grew uglier, as empty bellies and desperation began to conquer reason.
Any man who was not their friend became their enemy.
They knew that my father had opposed the strike, and now it was they who opposed him.
Huw, there's a meeting of the men in the hills tonight, is it?
Yes, Momma.
You will take me.
No, Momma.
It is no place for women.
There is a place for this woman there tonight... upon my soul.
Wait. Wait till you hear me.
I am Beth Morgan, as you damn well know.
I have come to tell you what I think of you, because you are talking against my husband.
You're a lot of cowards to go against him.
He would do nothing against you and he never has, and you know him well.
How you smug-faced hypocrites can sit in the same chapel with him, I cannot tell.
To say he is with the owners is not only nonsense, but downright wickedness.
There's one thing more I've got to say, and it is this.
If harm comes to my Gwilym,
I'll find out the men and I will kill them with my two hands.
And this I will swear by God Almighty.
Lanto! Help!
Hold on, Momma. They've heard us. They're coming.
He was awake just now.
He'll do, then.
But it's beyond me to say why.
You're breeding horses in this family, Mr Morgan.
This boy should be in his coffin, for my part.
He's a Morgan then, is it, sir?
He should be fed now, Mrs Ivor.
A little soup... and some warm smiles.
Horse.
Huw was awake just now. He spoke to Bron.
How long then for the little one?
It's hard to tell.
His legs were frozen to the bone.
A year, two years, quiet like that.
But I can't promise that he'll ever walk again.
Nature must take her course. Gee up.
Mind your tongue.
I think he heard you.
Where is the light I thought to see in your eye?
Are you afraid, boy?
You heard what the doctor said?
Yes, sir.
And you believed it?
Yes, sir.
You want to walk again, don't you?
Yes, sir.
Then you must have faith.
And if you have, you will walk again, no matter what all the doctors say.
But he said nature must take her course.
Nature is the handmaiden of the Lord.
I remember one or two occasions when she was given orders to change her course.
You know your scriptures, boy.
Then you know that what's been done before can be done again, for you.
Do you believe me, Huw?
Yes, sir.
Good.
You will see the first daffodil, out on the mountain. - Will you?
Indeed I will, sir.
Then you will.
I could almost wish that I were lying there in your place if it meant reading this book again for the first time.
Treasure Island.
Mr Gruffydd?
I couldn't let you go without thanking you.
It was only my duty, girl.
It was more than duty.
Huw's a fine boy.
And you're a fine family.
You'd better be going in now.
Will you be coming to supper soon?
Yes. Later, when you're finished with doctors and such.
I will hurry them away, then.
Squire Trelawney, Dr Livesey, and the rest of these gentlemen having asked me to write down the whole particulars about Treasure Island
from the beginning to the end, keeping nothing back but the bearings of the island, and only because there is still treasure not yet lifted,
I take up my pen in the year of grace 1785,
and go back to the time when my father kept the 'Admiral Benbow' inn."
All the noble books which have lived in my mind ever since, and always I hoped, and kept my faith.
For the first months my mother was still upstairs, and we could talk to each other with tappings.
Spring?
There you are, girl.
Easy.
It's the old snow got into it.
Gwilym.
There is a wife you have, resting in her bed and letting strangers care for her family.
There is a wife I have, then.
Go along with you, boy.
Will you say something, Mother?
Go on, say something.
What can I say?
You found plenty to say last time you spoke.
It should be easier now, with friends.
Well...
Come and eat, everyone.
Lanto.
I haven't seen you in chapel lately.
I have been too busy.
What business, may I ask?
Mine.
Only asking a civil question, I was.
And having a civil answer.
I have been busy with the union.
Unions are the work of the Devil.
You will come to no good end.
At least I am not sitting on it, talking rubbish in chapel.
Look here...
Leave it, or I'll say something to be sorry.
This is a matter that requires airing.
Lanto, why do you think we at the chapel talk rubbish?
My remark was not aimed at you.
Then aim it.
Very well.
Because you make yourselves out to be shepherds of the flock, and yet you allow your sheep to live in filth and poverty.
And if they try and raise their voices against it, you calm them by telling them their suffering is the will of God.
Sheep, indeed.
Are we sheep to be herded and sheared by a handful of owners?
I was taught man was made in the image of God, not a sheep.
Lanto.
I haven't expressed my views because I haven't had any wish to interfere in a family disagreement.
You have my permission to speak.
Very well, then. Here is what I think.
First, have your union.
You need it.
Alone, you are weak.
Together, you are strong.
But remember that with strength goes responsibility, to others and yourselves.
For you cannot conquer injustice with more injustice, only with justice, and the help of God.
Are you coming outside your position in life, Mr Gruffydd?
Your business is spiritual.
My business is anything between man and the spirit of God.
The deacons shall hear that you have been preaching socialism.
Mr Parry...
Loose the old devil.
Mr Parry... - Stop now. He is our guest.
Beth, a pint of home-brew for Mr Parry.
I'll give him a clout with the frying pan.
Miss Jenkins. A sweet song.
The harp, is it? Come on, men. Get in here.
Angharad.
Mr Gruffydd, will we always be in your debt?
Now you have made us a family again.
Here.
Your hands.
There's a pity.
No matter.
Have you ever been down the collieries?
Ten years.
Ten years?
While I was studying.
A bit of soap now.
Don't bother, please.
There's a man for you, spoiling his good handkerchief.
Look now, you are king in the chapel, but I will be queen in my own kitchen.
You will be queen wherever you walk.
What does that mean?
I should not have said it.
Why?
I have no right to speak to you so.
Mr Gruffydd?
If the right is mine to give, you have it.
Then the strike was settled, with the help of Mr Gruffydd and my father.
Work again, work to wipe out the memory of idleness and hardship.
The men were happy going up the hill that morning.
But not all of them, for there were too many now for the jobs open, and some learned that never again would there be work for them in their own valley.
It is the same all over South Wales, it is.
Father, in Cardiff the men are standing in line to have bread from the government.
Not for us, eh, lad?
We will have our share of the box and go, if you please, sir.
Where will you go?
America.
My share too, Owen.
And mine.
No.
Our own.
We will take no charity.
Not charity, man. Sense.
No, only our own.
Say nothing of this to your mother.
Let this day be over first.
Never mind saying nothing.
I heard.
America.
My babies.
Shall we have a chapter, my sons?
What shall we have, sir?
Isaiah 55.
Those two gone. This is only the beginning.
Then all of you will go, one after the other.
I will never leave you, Momma.
Huw, boy, if you should ever leave me, I'll be sorry I ever had babies.
Why did you have them?
Indeed to goodness, boy, why?
To keep my hands in water and my face to the fire, perhaps.
For Mr Ivor Morgan.
From Windsor Castle it is.
Mr Ivor Morgan is commanded to appear before Her Maj..."
Mr Ivor Morgan is commanded to appear before Her Majesty at Windsor Castle, with chosen members of his choir, on 14 May between the hours of three and five."
To sing before the Queen.
My son, I never thought to see this beautiful day.
Idris, Owen, all of you. Fetch everyone from all the valleys round.
Davy, over to the other collieries. Invite everyone.
Lanto, down to the Three Bells for beer. Open house tonight for all who will come.
My sons, you shall have a sendoff worthy of the Morgans.
Our Heavenly Father, I give thanks from the heart to live this day.
I give thanks for all I have, and I do give thanks for this new blessing.
For you are our Father, but we look to our Queen as our mother.
Comfort her in her troubles, O God, and let her worries be not more than she shall bear at her age.
And grant that sweetness and power and spirit may be given to these voices that shall sing at her command.
Amen.
Good morning, Mr Gruffydd.
Angharad is down to the market.
Angharad?
I've come for Huw.
For Huw?
The daffodils are out, Momma.
Where are your clothes?
Under my pillow.
For these months, ready for today.
Come you, then, and you shall bring back a posy fit for a queen for your brave mother.
Indeed I will, sir.
Almost there, Huw.
Yes, sir.
Low bridge there.
Watch out. - It's fun.
All right?
Easy it is, now.
Cwm Rhondda.
You can walk, Huw, if you try.
Come, lad. You can walk.
Huw.
Walk.
There's a good lad.
See?
There's a good old man.
You've been lucky, Huw.
Lucky to suffer, and lucky to spend these weary months in bed.
For so God has given you a chance to make spirit within yourself.
And as your father cleans his lamp to have good light, so keep clean your spirit, huh?
How, sir?
By prayer, Huw.
And by prayer I don't mean shouting and mumbling, and wallowing like a hog in religious sentiment.
Prayer is only another name for good, clean, direct thinking.
When you pray, think.
Think well what you're saying.
Make your thoughts into things that are solid, and in that way your prayer will have strength.
And that strength will become a part of you, body, mind and spirit.
And the first duty of these new legs is to get you to chapel on Sunday.
Indeed they will, sir.
There's a good old man again.
Give me your hand.
Come on, now.
Will you please remain in your places?
There's to be a meeting of the deacons.
Meillyn Lewis.
Step forward.
Your sins have found you out.
And now you must pay the price of all women like you.
You have brought a child into the world against the commandment.
Prayer is wasted on your sort.
You shall be cast out into the utter darkness till you have learned your lesson.
Meillyn Lewis, do you admit your sin?
Yes.
Then prepare to suffer your punishment.
Stop it.
Leave her alone, you hypocrite.
Leave it now, Mr Morgan.
Sit down.
How could you watch them?
Cruel old men, groaning and nodding to hurt her more.
That is not the word of God. "Go thou and sin no more," Jesus said.
Angharad.
You know your Bible too well, life too little.
I know Meillyn Lewis is no worse than I am.
Angharad.
What do the deacons know about it?
What do you know about what could happen to a poor girl when... when she loves a man so much that even to lose sight of him for a moment is torture?
Easy, now.
Angharad.
I am a man now. Kindly leave the kitchen.
So you're a man now, is it?
Beth.
Blasphemy, sacrilege and hypocrisy.
Can't a man smoke and read a paper on the Sabbath?
Go and blow your nose.
Come in.
Come in.
What under the blazes...
Good morning, Morgan.
Good morning, Mr Evans.
Sit down, sir.
Sit down, sir.
Thank you.
Mr Evans.
The mine owner himself.
Now to business.
Yes, sir.
I've come here on a very delicate mission, Morgan.
No trouble, sir?
No trouble. - But it worries me.
I'm here to get your permission that my son lestyn
Bless you, Morgan.
Thank you, sir.
Now where was I?
Permission"?
Yes.
That my son lestyn may have permission, with your daughter's permission, to call upon her.
There we are.
We are a very proud family, Mr Evans.
Yes, I know. I know, Morgan.
But this is not my doing, Morgan. It's that young whelp of a...
Mr Evans. Your son has my permission to speak to me.
Thank you, Morgan. I'm very much obliged to you.
Yes, sir.
Good old Welsh blood, you know, and all that sort of thing.
I'm very much obliged, Morgan.
Beth.
Come, come, come. My shoes.
Get my shoes.
You, girl. Get up to your room. Have you no modesty left in you?
My shoes. Find the shoes.
Why don't you get yourjackets on?
Mr Morgan?
Sit down.
This is my wife, Mrs Morgan.
How do you do?
Mr Morgan, I've come to ask your permission to speak to your daughter, Angharad.
These are my sons.
Yes. I know them.
God bless you.
You shouldn't be here.
I couldn't spend another night without knowing.
What has happened?
Is anything wrong?
Wrong?
You know what I mean.
Why have you changed towards me?
Why am I a stranger now? Have I done anything?
No.
The blame is mine.
Your mother spoke to me after chapel.
She's happy to think you'll be having plenty all of your days.
With lestyn Evans.
You could do no better.
I don't want him. I want you.
Angharad?
I have spent nights too, trying to think this out.
When I took up this work, I knew what it meant.
It meant sacrifice and devotion.
It meant making it my whole life to the...
to the exclusion of everything else.
That I was perfectly willing to do.
But to share it with another...
Do you think I will have you going threadbare, depending on the charity of others for your good meals?
Our children growing up in cast-off clothing, and ourselves thanking God for parenthood in a house full of bits?
I can bear with such a life for the sake of my work, but I think I'd start to kill if... if I saw the white come to your hair 20 years before its time.
Why?
Why would you start to kill?
Are you a man or a saint?
I am no saint.
But I have a duty towards you. Let me do it.
Is there to be no singing for my daughter's wedding, Dai Bando?
The bathtub holds 100 gallons.
A" fills it at the rate of 20 gallons a minute, and "B" at the rate of ten gallons a minute.
Got that, Mr Morgan?
Twenty and ten gallons.
Yes, sir.
Now then. "C" is a hole that empties it at the rate of five gallons a minute.
How long to fill the tub?
There is silly.
Trying to fill a bathtub full of holes, indeed.
A sum it is, girl. A sum.
A problem for the mind.
For his examination into school.
That old national school.
'Tis silly they are with their sums.
Who would pour water in a bathtub full of holes?
Who would think of it? Only a madman.
It is to see if the boy can calculate.
Figures, nothing else.
How many gallons, and how long.
In a bathtub full of holes.
Now I know why I have such a tribe of sons.
It is you, Beth Morgan, is the cause.
Look you, Mr Gruffydd. Have you something else?
The decimal point.
The decimal...
The decimal point, then, and peace to my house.
Go and scratch.
Well, it's getting late. I've got to get along.
We'll follow the decimal point tomorrow night.
Good night.
Good night, Mrs Morgan.
Who is there that cannot look back and remember his first day at a new school?
To go alone the long walk over the hills to the next valley, the first of my family to have the privilege of attending a national school.
So you're the new boy?
Yes, sir.
You're late.
Yes, sir.
What a dirty little sweep it is.
Who are your people?
Where are you from?
Cwm Rhondda.
Cwm Rhondda?
A little genius from the coal pits.
And they expect me to make a scholar of it.
All right, come in.
Were you brought up in stables?
Well, shut the door.
Your boots are muddy.
They were clean when I left home.
You will address me as "sir", or I'll put a stick about your back.
Now sit down here.
Come here, you dirty little sweep.
What have we here?
A pencil box.
Pretty, too.
You broke my pencil box.
Mervyn, stop it. You'll hurt him.
I fell on the mountain.
Did you win, Huw?
No.
Lanto.
Fetch Dai Bando.
Dai Bando, is it?
Are you willing to go to school tomorrow?
Yes, sir. Good.
You shall get a penny for every mark on your face, sixpence for a bloody nose, a shilling for a black eye, two shillings for a broken nose.
Gwilym.
Stop it.
Fight again, and when you come home, not a look will you get from me, not a word.
Break your own nose, then.
Break my heart every time you go out of the house.
A boy must fight, Beth.
Fight? Fight?
Another beating like that, he will walk home dead. Beating?
He's had no beating.
A hiding, yes, but no beating.
Give the boy time, it will be he that's giving the beating, is it?
Dai Bando. Come into the house.
Good evening, Mrs Morgan.
Leave off your hat.
Dai Bando is going to teach you to box, Huw.
To fight first.
Too many call themselves boxers who are not even fighters.
Boxing is an art, is it?
It is, it is.
Go along with you, girl. A cup of tea for the men.
Tea?
Tea?
No tea, Mrs Morgan.
In training, he is.
A glass of beer, if you please.
Baths full of holes.
And now prizefighters.
So our little coal miner has been indulging in his favourite sport again?
Mr Phillips, make a back.
Make a back.
I refuse, sir.
Mr Wells, make a back.
Here.
Put this in between your teeth.
Bite it hard.
Well, the scholar.
Huw, lad.
Well, I will go to my death.
Did you get that in school?
He has cut you to the bone.
Who was it?
Mr Jonas, is it?
We'll have a word with Mr Jonas.
No.
And why not?
I broke the rule when I fought.
There is no rule for that.
But he warned me. - Rubbish, boy.
I'll...
Hush, Davy.
This is Huw's affair.
He shall decide.
Say the word, lad, and we will have the bones hot from his flesh.
No.
Leave him alone.
I think our baby brother is becoming quite a man.
These denominations are used in measuring distances and...
Yes?
Good morning, Mr...
Jonas.
Mr Jonas.
We have come to the right place indeed.
What can I do for you?
A man is never too old to learn, is it, Mr Jonas?
No.
I was in school myself once.
But no great one for knowledge.
Look here, what do you want?
Knowledge.
How would you go about taking the measurement of a stick, Mr Jonas?
By its length, of course.
And how would you measure a man who would use a stick on a boy one third his size?
Tell us.
Now, you are good in the use of a stick.
But boxing is my subject, to the rules laid down by the good Marquess of Queensberry.
God rest his soul.
And happy I am to pass on my knowledge to you.
Mr Mottshill.
All right, get him into position, now.
Look, to make a good boxer, you must have a good right hand.
Now, that is how you will punish your man, with a right and a left.
And put your soul into it, with...
The gentleman is talking to you.
Raise him up.
Come, come, come. Up, up, up.
Position again.
Could I have your attention, boys and girls?
I am not accustomed to speaking in public...
Only public houses.
Never use. It's against the rules. Break a man's nose.
I'm afraid he will never make a boxer.
No aptitude for knowledge.
Mr Gruffydd.
Ivor... fell under a tram, lower level.
Ivor!
We have our first grandson, Gwil.
Well, give one and take the other.
Tell that to that girl up there. She will answer you.
Hist now, Beth. Do not kindle the wrath.
To hell with the wrath.
And I'm saying it plain to be heard.
'Tis good.
With honours, then.
Our son is a scholar.
What is it, Huw?
I can't make sense with it.
Latin, it is.
Latin, is it? Why not good Welsh, or even English?
It is the fashion.
Fashion.
Frenchies, decimal points, and bathtubs full of holes.
My poor Huw. They've stuffed your head with Latin, then?
Beth, my old beauty, you. A black eye, is it?
Go ahead, shout. Wake up the baby, then.
There is beautiful.
The image of my father, he is.
What bloody nonsense.
Now then, Huw. What will it be?
To Cardiff to school, then the university to be a lawyer, is it, or a doctor?
Dr Huw Morgan.
Well, Uncle Huw, that will be something special.
Yes, indeed, with a lovely horse and trap, and a good black suit and a shirt with starch. Now, a glass of buttermilk for you, with all your knowledge. There is good, my little one.
Yes, Mother.
And some of Bron's shortcake.
And my shortcake is to be fed to the pigs, is it? No.
Only I finished yours yesterday, and today is shortcake day with Bron.
I'm sorry, Huw.
Only currant bread I made today.
Nobody to eat it now.
Mother.
I am lonely without him.
I put his boots and clothes ready every night, but they are there still in the morning.
There is lonely I am.
Gwil, I will have Bron here to live if she will come.
Not Bron.
One mistress in the house.
Now, Huw, what will it be?
I will go down the colliery with you, sir.
Have sense, boy. The colliery is no place for you.
Why not try for a respectable job?
Respectable?
Are you and his brothers a lot of old jailbirds, then?
Leave it now, Beth.
I only want the best for the boy.
If he is as good a man as you and his brothers, I will rest happy.
I am thinking of the boy's future.
It was different in our day. There was good money and fair play for all.
But Huw is a scholar.
Why take brains down a coal mine?
I would rather, sir.
All right.
Decide for yourself.
But blame yourself if you are wrong.
The colliery, sir.
All right, the colliery it is.
Good.
Where are you going?
To get drunk.
I am going down the colliery.
The colliery, is it?
The old coal will be shaking in its seam.
Bron...
Bron.
Would you have me to live in this house, and have my wages?
Your home is with your mother.
It was she who sent me.
From pity.
No, from sense.
If you put clothes night and morning, let them be my clothes.
Good old man.
Yes or no, Bron?
Yes.
Good.
I will get my bed.
So it is a man now, is it?
And could I carry such a man?
Lanto! No.
Five shillings.
Seven and tuppence.
Move along.
Thank you, sir.
One pound two.
Two pounds ten.
Discharged, Morgan.
Move along.
Two pound ten.
Discharged, Morgan.
One pound ten.
And so it came to Ianto and Davy, the best workers in the colliery, but too highly paid to compete with poorer, more desperate men.
Will you read us a chapter, Father?
Yes, my son.
The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want."
He maketh me to lie down in green pastures:
He leadeth me beside the still waters."
He restoreth my soul:
He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake."
Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
I will fear no evil: For thou art with me."
Thy rod and thy staff they comfort me."
Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies:
Thou anointest my head with oil."
My cup runneth over."
One line to Owen and Gwil, down to Cape Town to Angharad.
Over here to Canada to Ianto, and down here to Davy in New Zealand.
And you are the star, shining on them from this house, all the way across the continents and oceans.
All the way?
How far am I shining then, if you can put it all on a little piece of paper?
Now, a map it is, my old beauty.
A picture of the world to show you where they are.
I know where they are, without any old maps, or scratches, or spiders, or pencils.
They are in the house.
Then Angharad came back from Cape Town without her husband.
She did not come to us, but stayed at the big Evans house.
Her house, on top of the hill.
To see Mrs Evans, please.
Who is it?
Huw Morgan.
Her brother, is it?
Come in.
Huw.
Mrs Nicholas, will you bring some tea, please?
Sit down, Huw.
There is grown you are.
And changed.
You too.
I look ill and ought to take care of myself.
Everyone coming in the house says so, so you say it too, and let us finish with it.
But tell me all the news.
How is...
How are all the boys and girls we used to know?
The Jenkins girls are married.
Maldwyn Hughes has gone to be a doctor.
Rhys Howell is in a solicitor's office, and is sending home ten shillings a week.
And Mr Gruffydd... is still first up and last to bed.
How is he, Huw?
Not as he was.
Is he ill?
Inside.
In his eyes and in his voice.
Like you.
Please go home, Huw.
I'm sorry.
Now then, Mrs Evans. Tea, is it?
Leave it, Mrs Nicholas.
I will pour.
I always did the pouring for Mr lestyn's poor mother.
I will pour.
Yes, Mrs Evans.
A new mistress is like new sheets. A little bit stiff, but washing's to come. Yes.
Why do you have her here?
37 years with the family.
Or so she tells me 60 times a day.
Have some tea, Huw.
You don't want me to go?
No. No, Huw.
I'm sorry for being nasty.
Please stay.
I tried to tell Mother, but...
Not for me to say.
Only the housekeeper I am.
37 years in the family, and living to curse the day.
It will not surprise me any day to see the old master rise from his grave.
'Tis only the gravestone holding him down, I will swear.
Then what is it, Mrs Nicholas?
Divorce.
Divorce.
Saying nothing, I am.
But that is what is in her mind.
She is here without her husband, is it?
And why?
It is because she is in love with this preacher.
Preacher, I said. Mr Gruffydd, it is.
But Mr Gruffydd has not been near the house.
What difference is that, girl?
Get on with your work.
We will not say a word, Mrs Nicholas.
No.
Let up!
Liar!
As the slag had spread over my valley, so now a blackness spread over the minds of its people.
For the first time in my memory, our front door was shut tight in the daytime.
Dadda?
Well, Huw?
Trouble with the Philistines, is it?
Huw, what is it now?
Look at your hands.
Evan John.
He... he said things about Angharad and Mr Gruffydd.
Children too.
You were right, my son.
I will be back for breakfast.
You will not go to chapel?
No.
And if they do this thing,
I will never set foot in the chapel again as long as I live.
I will have the sheets warm on your bed.
There is an old beauty you are.
Go and scratch, boy.
What is this about the chapel, Mother?
Tonight, after the service.
A deacons' meeting over Angharad.
Angharad?
But she has done nothing.
Nothing is enough for people who have minds like cesspools.
Huw, my little one.
I hope when you're grown, their tongues will be slower to hurt.
Will Angharad have to be at the meeting?
No.
None of us will be there.
But the disgrace will not stay away.
I will go, Mother.
This is the last time I will talk in this chapel.
I am leaving the valley with regret toward those who have helped me here, and who have let me help them.
But... for the rest of you,
those of you who have only proved that I have wasted my time among you,
I have only this to say.
There is not one among you who has had the courage to come to me and accuse me of wrongdoing.
And yet, by any standard, if there has been a sin,
I am the one who should be branded the sinner.
Will anyone raise his voice here now to accuse me?
No.
You're cowards, too, as well as hypocrites.
But I don't blame you.
The fault is mine as much as yours.
The idle tongues, the poverty of mind which you have shown,
mean that I have failed to reach most of you with the lesson I was given to teach.
I thought when I was a young man that I would conquer the world, with truth.
I thought I would lead an army greater than Alexander ever dreamed of.
Not to conquer nations, but to liberate mankind.
With truth.
With the golden sound of the Word.
But only a few of them heard.
Only a few of you understood.
The rest of you put on black and sat in chapel.
Why do you come here?
Why do you dress your hypocrisy in black and parade before your God on Sunday?
From love? No.
For you've shown that your hearts are too withered to receive the love of your divine Father.
I know why you've come.
I've seen it in your faces Sunday after Sunday as I've stood here before you.
Fear has brought you here.
Horrible, superstitious fear.
Fear of divine retribution.
A bolt of fire from the skies, the vengeance of the Lord, and the justice of God.
But you have forgotten the love of Jesus.
You disregard his sacrifice.
Death.
Fear.
Flames, horror, and black clothes.
Hold your meeting, then.
But know if you do this in the name of God, and in the house of God, you blaspheme against him and his Word.
Wait.
There is a meeting, Master Morgan.
Well, Huw.
I'm glad you've come.
Thank you, sir.
Is there anything I can do?
Indeed there is.
You can do me a great service.
This watch.
My father gave it to me when I entered the ministry.
It's marked time we've both loved.
Take it.
No, sir.
A service, I said you'd be doing me.
No need for us to shake hands.
We will live in the minds of each other.
Mr Gruffydd, won't you see Angharad before you go?
She wants you to.
No.
If I were to see her again,
I couldn't find the strength to leave her.
Goodbye, Huw.
And there's a good old man you are.
What is it now?
Fire, or flood, or what?
A cave-in, they are saying.
Take me up there.
What good in the darkness of a mine?
Your eyes are no good in daylight from the blows you've taken in the ring.
I can still swing a pick deeper than any man.
Men. Men. Women.
Gwilym Morgan?
Not yet, sir.
Mr Gruffydd?
On the lower level, he was.
My father?
Not yet, Mrs Evans.
Who is for Gwilym Morgan and the others?
I for one.
He is the blood of my heart.
Come, Cyfartha.
'Tis a coward I am.
But I will hold your coat.
Dadda!
Huw, lad.
Dadda!
Mr Gruffydd!
There's a good old man you are.
He came to me just now.
Ivor was with him.
He spoke to me, and told me of the glory he had seen.
Look.
Men like my father cannot die.
They are with me still, real in memory as they were in flesh, loving and beloved for ever.
How green was my valley then.
Once a day is plenty. Just a couple of flies, a sip of milk and perhaps a pigeon's egg on Sundays.
I certainly will, Professor.
Keep her warm as you get farther north, and let her out of her box to play.
I certainly will, Professor.
Tell Dr. Marzditz I have named her Columbrina Marzditzia.
And this is only the beginning of what I am bringing out when I come out.
I'll do that, and I want to tell you... I want to tell you how much I've enjoyed being on this expedition with you.
If I had my way, this is the way I'd like to spend all my time, in the company of men like yourselves in the pursuit of knowledge.
So long, Lulu. I'll send you a postcard.
Good-bye, Charlie.
If you get a chance to come back, this is where we'll be.
Give my affectionate salutations to your father.
Thank him for making the Pike expedition possible and, I hope, a success.
I will, Professor.
Good-bye, my boy. - Good-bye, Muggsy. - So long.
Don't take no wooden money.
Good-bye, Sparky.
Good-bye, Charlie.
Bye, Mac.
Good-bye, Charlie.
Bye, boys.
So long, "Sarlie".
So long, gang.
Be careful of the traffic. You haven't dodged any in a long time.
And be careful of the dames. You've not dodged them for a long time either.
You know me, Mac, nothing but reptiles.
That's right, my boy.
Good-bye.
There he is!
You'd think he'd have a bigger yacht than that if he's so rich.
That isn't a yacht. That's a tender.
What's a tender?
I said Pabst.
It was Pike.
So what? - Go put on your shorts.
You can try.
Mom, it makes me puke.
Puke?
No, Pike!
Go put on your peekaboo.
Get down there and make it fast.
Gee, I hope he's rich. I hope he thinks he's a wizard at cards.
From your lips to the ear of the Almighty.
I hope he's got a fat wife so I don't have to dance in the moonlight with him.
A sucker always steps on your feet.
A mug is a mug in everything.
I don't see why I have to do the work.
There must be plenty of rich old dames just waiting for you to push 'em around.
You find 'em. I'll push 'em.
Would I like to see you giving some old harpy the three-in-one.
Don't be vulgar, Jean. Let us be crooked but never common.
Is he rich?
As the purser so picturesquely put it, he's dripping with dough.
He'd almost have to be to stop a boat.
What does he own, Pike's Peak?
Oh, no, no. Pike's Pale, "The ale that won for Yale".
I wonder if I could clunk him. - Don't do that!
Hey!
Two Pike's Pale. - Now, wait a minute!
Six more Pike's Pale, and make it snappy.
Are you trying to embarrass me? We're all out of Pike's. - Work 'em over on something else.
They don't want nothin' else. They want the ale that won for Yale. Rah, rah, rah!
Well, tell 'em to go to Harvard.
Come on.
How many times do I have to tell ya...
Four Pike's Pale.
Now listen!
Not good enough. - What'd you say?
I said they're not good enough for him.
EveryJane in the room... is giving him the thermometer, and he feels they're just a waste of time.
He's returning to his book. He's deeply immersed in it.
He's sees no one except... Watch his head turn when that kid goes by.
It won't do you any good, dear. He's a bookworm, but swing 'em anyway.
Ah, how about this one?
How would you like that hanging on your Christmas tree? Oh, you wouldn't?
Well, what is your weakness, brother?
Holy smoke, the dropped kerchief!
Hasn't been used since Lily Langtry. You'll have to pick it up yourself. It's a shame that he doesn't care for the flesh.
Look at that girl over to his left. Look over to your left, bookworm.
There's a girl pining for you.
A little further. Just a little further. There!
Wasn't that worth looking for?
See those nice teeth beaming at you?
Why, she recognizes you. She's up. She's down.
She's up again. She recognizes you. She's coming over to speak to you.
The suspense is killing me.
Why, for heaven's sake, Aren't you Fuzzy Oldhammer I went to manual training school with?
You're not? You certainly look exactly like him... a remarkable resemblance.
If you're not going to ask me to sit, I suppose you're not going to ask me.
Sorry. I certainly hope I haven't caused you any embarrassment.
I wonder if my tie's on straight.
I certainly upset them, don't I?
Who else? The lady champion wrestler.
Wouldn't she make a houseful?
You don't like her either.
What are you going to do about it? You just can't stand it anymore. You're leaving.
These women don't give you a moment's peace, do they? Go sulk in your cabin.
Go soak your head and see if I care!
I'm very sorry, sir.
That's all right.
Why don't you look where you're going?
Why don't I look?
Look, you knocked the heel off.
Oh, I did? I'm sorry.
You did, and you can take me right to my cabin for another pair of slippers.
The least I can do. My name's Pike. - Everybody knows.
Nobody's talking about anything else.
This is my father Colonel Harrington. My name is Jean. It's really Eugenia.
Funny our meeting like this, isn't it?
Yes, isn't it?
This is quite a cabin.
Pretty cozy, isn't it?
Holy Moses!
What's the matter?
That perfume.
What's the matter with it?
It's just that I've been up the Amazon for a year, and they don't use perfume.
Oh. The shoes are over here.
Because you were so polite, you can pick them out and put them on if you like.
Push that side.
Holy Moses!
See anything you like?
The evening slippers are over there.
Those the ones you want?
Doesn't seem possible for anybody to wear anything that size.
Oh, that's pretty.
You'll have to kneel down.
I hope I didn't hurt you.
Of course you didn't.
Don't you feel well?
Oh, I'm all right.
What were you doing up the Amazon?
Looking for snakes. - I'm an ophiologist.
I thought you were in the beer business.
Beer? Ale! - What's the difference?
Between beer and ale?
My father'd burst a blood vessel if he heard you say that.
There's a big difference. Ale's sort of fermented on the top or something.
And beer's fermented on the bottom. Or maybe it's the other way around. There's no similarity at all.
The trouble with being descended from a brewer, no matter how long ago he "brewed-ed" or whatever you call it, you're supposed to know all about something you don't give a hoot about.
It's funny to be kneeling here at your feet talking about beer.
You see, I don't like beer.
Bock beer, lager beer or steam beer.
Don't you?
I do not!
And I don't like pale ale, brown ale, nut brown ale, porter or stout, which makes me "ulp" just to think about it.
Excuse me.
Wasn't enough, so everybody would call me Hopsie ever since I was six. - Hopsie Pike.
Hello, Hopsie.
Make it, Charlie, will you?
All right, but there's something kinda cute about Hopsie. And when you get older, I could call you Popsie. Hopsie Popsie.
That's all I'd need.
Here's a business I wouldn't mind. I never realized how lovely it could be.
Oh, thank you.
We'd better get back now.
Yes, I guess so.
You see, where I've been...
I mean, up the Amazon, you kind of forget how... I mean, when you haven't seen a girl in a long time...
I mean, uh, there's something about that perfume that...
Don't you like my perfume?
Like it? I'm cockeyed on it.
Why, Hopsie, you ought to be kept in a cage.
The nerve of some people.
Ah, there you are. It certainly took you long enough to come back in the same outfit.
I'm lucky to have this on. Mr. Pike has been up a river for a year.
Now, look, I...
Pay no attention to my daughter.
It always comes out in the women of our family.
The men are all missionaries, with the exception of myself.
And what an exception. - Won't you have a drink with us?
Just a brandy. You have it with me.
Three brandies. - Yes, sir.
Have you seen this one?
Oh, he does card tricks!
In a small way, of course.
Well, bless my soul.
Do that again, will you?
Amazing. How do you do it?
You palm it in this hand. You grip it in the palm of the hand like this.
It takes a good deal of practice.
I can well imagine it might. Amazing. It's good I know who you are or I wouldn't play cards with you.
Sir?
You didn't really think that, uh...
Oh, of course not, silly. - You look as honest as we do.
Three brandies.
Washington and Valley Forge.
Dewey and Manila.
Napoleon and Josephine.
Say, how about a rubber of bridge?
You're probably too good for us.
I don't have to play my best. Besides, playing with you... - would always be a pleasure.
Aren't you sweet?
Who'll we get for a fourth?
Isn't there a three-handed game? I seem vaguely to remember having...
Of course there is, and it'll be much cozier.
Will you shuffle?
Well, I'll try.
Every man for himself.
I, uh, what?
You go up the Amazon for a year, and then you come out and meet you...
I'll be a cockeyed cookie pusher!
Ha! - What's the matter now?
Come on, deal them shingles.
You don't happen to have some beautiful damsel pining for you, do you?
That often explains it.
Come on.
I really feel very guilty about this.
Don't let it worry you.
It's a good thing we're not playing for money, or I'd have you in bankruptcy.
This last hand alone... - Weren't we playing for money?
Of course not.
I never play for money. We always play for money. Otherwise, it's like swimming in an empty pool.
Lf you count that last redouble, it's...
Nonsense, my boy. - At ten cents a point?
At ten cents a point? Purely nominal.
Now, let me see. Five, ten...
You'll ruin us.
Four ninety-eight. Roughly $500.
Oh, wait a minute.
Father's in the oil business.
It just keeps bubbling up out of the ground.
I thought with the title of colonel...
Purely honorary. - How much do I owe the sucker? - Now, let me see.
Two, four, six...
Who's that funny-looking gink watching us?
Everything on the up-and-up?
Everything's okay. Go to bed. I'm way ahead.
All right.
Who's that, your nurse?
That's Muggsy. My father took him off a truck when I was a kid to look out for me. Kidnappers, stuff like that.
He's been sort of a bodyguard, governess and a very bad valet ever since.
He saved my life once in a brawl.
Roughly $100. - That's rough enough.
Since I had no understanding that...
Don't worry. I'll get it back.
Well, if that's a promise.
You can depend upon it.
I'll certainly feel better.
You certainly will.
I think I'll toddle off... and leave you young people to talk about whatever young people talk about.
I'm awfully sorry about this.
Beeswax, my boy, beeswax.
Good night, Jeanie.
He's a nice fellow, your father.
He's a good card player too.
You think so?
I don't want to be rude, - but he seemed a little uneven.
He's more uneven sometimes than others.
That's what makes him uneven. But now you, on the other hand, with a little coaching, you could be terrific.
Do you really think so?
Yes, you have a definite nose.
I'm glad you like it. Do you like any of the rest of me?
Oh, what I meant was in the card-playing sense...
I know what you meant. I was just flirting with you.
You're not going to faint, are you?
Who, me? Uh, it's that perfume.
Do you think they're dancing anyplace on board?
Don't you think we ought to go to bed?
You're certainly a funny girl for anybody to meet... who's just been up the Amazon for a year.
Good thing you weren't up there two years.
Come on.
Good night.
I'm afraid we're on the wrong deck.
Isn't that a coincidence?
For heaven's sake, here's my cabin.
Fantastic!
Would you care to come in and see Emma?
That's a new one, isn't it?
I don't want to wake her up.
Wake who up?
Emma.
Emma?
I thought that was just a gag.
Technically, she's a Columbrina Marzditzia, which seems to be a rare type of Brazilian glass snake, which I'm...
A snake!
She seems to have got out again.
She's out?
Well, don't worry. She's around here someplace.
Let me out of here!
Oh, don't be frightened. She's as playful as a kitten.
You mustn't really... Don't do that!
I wouldn't have frightened you for anything in the world.
Why didn't you tell me...
I thought you understood.
How could I understand?
Why should I suspect an apparently civilized man...
Please. - Oh.
Look under the bed.
How could she possibly get down here? - Please!
Oh, all right.
Please.
It's just a stocking.
If you see any more, just leave them there. Now, look in the bed.
In the bed? How could she possibly...
Oh, go on now.
You know how fast we came down, so you can imagine...
It's nothing, but it might have given you a shock. - Nothing like a cold hot water bottle.
They would have had to bury me at sea. Come over here and sit down beside me. Oh.
Comfortable? - Yes, very.
Oh, sorry.
Hold me tight.
Oh, you don't know what you've done to me.
I'm terribly sorry.
Oh, that's all right.
I wouldn't have frightened you for anything in the world.
I mean, if there's anyone in the world I wouldn't have wanted to, it's you.
You're very sweet. Don't let me go.
Thank you.
How was everything up the Amazon? A-All right, thank you.
What are you thinking about?
Nothing.
Are you always going to be interested in snakes?
Well, snakes are my life in a way. What a life.
Oh, I-I suppose it does sound sort of silly.
I mean, I suppose I should have married and settled down. I imagine my father always wanted me to.
As a matter of fact, he's told me so rather plainly.
I just never cared for the brewing business. Oh.
You say that's why you've never married?
Oh, no. It's just that I... I've never met her.
It would be too bad if you never bumped into each other.
Well...
I-I suppose you know what she looks like and everything. I think so.
I'll bet she looks like Marguerite in Faust.
Oh, no, she isn't...
I mean, she hasn't...
She's not as bulky as an opera singer. - Oh.
How are her teeth? - Huh?
You should always pick one out with good teeth. It saves expense later.
Oh, now you're kidding me.
Not badly.
You have a right to have an ideal.
Oh, I guess we all have one.
What does yours look like?
He's a little short guy with lots of money.
Why short?
What does it matter if he's rich?
It's so he'll look up to me, so I'll be his ideal. - That's a funny kind of reasoning.
Well, look who's reasoning.
And when he takes me out to dinner, he'll never add up the check.
And he won't smoke greasy cigars or use grease on his hair, and...
Oh, yes, he won't do card tricks. - Oh!
Oh, it's not that I mind your doing card tricks, Hopsie.
It's just that you naturally wouldn't want your ideal to do card tricks.
I shouldn't think that kind of ideal was so difficult to find.
Oh, he isn't. That's why he's my ideal. What's the sense of having one if you can't ever find him?
Mine is a practical ideal... you can find two or three of in every barber shop getting the works.
Why don't you marry one of them?
Why should I marry anybody that looked like that?
When I marry, it's going to be somebody I've never seen before.
I won't know what he looks like or where he'll come from or what he'll be.
I want him to sort of take me by surprise. Like a burglar.
That's right.
And the night will be heavy with perfume, and I'll hear a step behind me... and somebody breathing heavily.
You better go to bed, Hopsie.
I think I can sleep peacefully now.
I wish I could say the same.
Why, Hopsie!
Ah, good morning, Mr. Murgatroyd.
I trust I see you full of sparkle.
Morning.
Have a dish of tea?
I had my breakfast. Where I come from we get up in the morning.
And where did it get you? Or is that a personal question?
Where did it get me?
Good morning, sir.
Fruit, cereal, bacon and eggs, eggs and sausage, sausage and hot cakes, hot cakes and ham, ham and eggs, eggs and bacon, bacon and...
Give me a spoonful of milk, a raw pigeon's egg and four houseflies.
If you can't catch any, I'll settle for a cockroach.
Did you get it? - Close enough.
There.
Dunk your whiskers in that.
How much you say you win last night?
About $600. - I'm going to try to lose it back.
I don't get it. - I lose 40 bucks to their valet, and I figure the guy's a cutie.
Because he took you? Who do you think you are, Houdini?
You don't have to be a whodunit to tell a cold deck.
All you have to know is the difference between hot and cold. - That guy rung a cold deck in on me.
Balderdash! You're always suspicious of everybody.
Remember the clergyman you said was a pickpocket and he turned out a bishop?
I still ain't so sure.
The guy trying to slip you a mickey? - Only he was taking aspirin.
I ain't so sure about him neither.
I suppose you think this gentleman and his daughter... lost $600 to me just so they could fleece me later.
Yeah.
Yeah? Well, in the first place, he happens to be Colonel Harrington, a very important oil man.
In the second place, I'm an expert card player. I've been fooling with cards all my life. I do tricks with cards.
They might know a couple of tricks you ain't seen yet.
What's the matter?
Oh, I'm sorry. That slimy snake. - I've been dreaming about him all night.
You mean Pike?
No, his reptile.
He travels with a snake act. He's a... He's an ophi...
Oh, I don't know. He likes snakes.
You mean he isn't in the beer business?
He's in the ale business. It seems there's a very big difference.
You had me worried. I thought we'd sweetened the wrong kitty.
Oh, no, he's the real McPike. Hmm. - That poor sap.
That card trick. - Tragic.
What are you dealing?
Fifths.
Like heck you're dealing fifths.
Want to bet?
Do it again.
Now let me see the aces.
Now, let me see them.
I don't believe it.
It's just virtuosity.
Harry.
Yes, darling?
Tell me my fortune.
Good morning. Thank you for the roses. Gee, you look pretty.
I hope you slept well.
I'm still a little jumpy.
How is that, uh, Emma?
She's just having breakfast.
What does she eat? Don't tell me.
No, I won't.
I hope you didn't mind my asking you to breakfast.
It wouldn't be polite if I said I did, would it?
No, I don't suppose it would.
And it wouldn't be true either.
You have the darnedest way of bumping a fellow down and bouncing him up again.
And then bumping him down again.
Oh.
I could imagine life with you being a series of ups and downs, lights and shadows, some irritation, but very much happiness.
Why, Hopsie!
Are you proposing to me so soon?
No, of course not. I'm just...
Then you ought to be more careful.
People have been sued for much less.
Not by girls like you.
Don't you know it's dangerous to trust people you don't know very well?
Well, I know you very well.
People you haven't known very long.
Oh, I've known you a long time in a way.
Breakfast, sir?
What did you say? - I said breakfast, sir?
Two scotch and sodas with plain water.
You take it plain, don't you?
Don't you take cream and sugar in it? - No, I always drink it black.
Oh.
Say, what am I talking about?
That's what I was wondering.
How about a nice bicarbonate of soda with an egg in it?
It does wonders.
He doesn't understand.
Want the strippers on the right?
I hardly need them, Gerald. - I can take this boy with a deck.
Just to be on the safe side. - High card cuts on the outside, cold hands in the middle.
# Cold hands I love #
Blue readers on the outside, red nearest the heart.
I could play the whole ship with these.
Hello, Harry. Hello, Gerald. - Hello, Jean.
Greetings, my little minx.
I hope I find you well and that your little pal hasn't fallen overboard.
With our $600.
He's jut gone to dress for dinner.
You'd better do the same, because we are going to play cards tonight. - And I don't mean "old maid".
I think Charles is in love with me.
No!
Of course he's in love with you.
Who is he not to be in love with you who have beautified the North Atlantic? - Better men than he...
I mean on the level.
The others were on the bias?
Oh, stop kidding.
I'm not kidding. I was never more delighted.
You have as usual taken...
You don't get the point. I like him.
Why shouldn't you like him?
There's as fine a specimen of the sucker sapiens as I've have ever seen.
There's a man who does card tricks! - I think he's going to ask me to marry him.
No!
No!
Yes.
That's wonderful, Jean.
No wonder you're blushing.
And that fortunate young man.
Fortunate, indeed.
Can't you hear his pulses pounding? His ears must be ringing like telephone bells.
His hands are clammy with excitement.
He won't know an ace from a deuce.
You weren't thinking of taking him?
What were you thinking of?
I don't think you understand, either of you.
This is on the up-and-up.
I-I think I'm in love with the poor fish, snakes and all. He's...
Oh, I don't know. He's kind of touched something in my heart. And I'd give a lot to be...
Well, I mean, I'm going to be exactly the way he thinks I am. - The way he'd like me to be.
I'm sure that's very noble, Jean. And I wish you all the happiness in the world,
All the boys and girls you want.
You'll go straight too?
Straight to where?
You know what I mean.
You can come and live with us. You too, Gerald. Well, part of the time anyway.
We'll probably have a beautiful place. And think how peaceful you can be.
Playing cribbage with Gerald. I can see myself roaming around your estate... with a weedsticker, 50 cents a week and a pair of new slippers for Christmas.
The trouble with people who reform is they want to rain on everybody else's parade.
Tend to knitting. I'll play cards.
Not with him.
Remember that sucker has $500 of ours?
Six hundred.
I suppose you could take that back.
You bet I could, and a little dividend along with it.
Oh, no.
Oh, yes.
You'll find I can play a cards myself.
You think so?
I'm not your daughter for free.
Give me a pack of those. You'll find out.
Children don't respect their parents anymore.
I haven't been quite as lucky tonight as usual, have I?
You don't know how lucky. The colonel has been drawing wonderful cards.
I believe it's my deal.
I haven't got my mind on the game.
I noticed that. How much are you behind?
Oh, about $3,000.
Well, well, well. You've given me a good hand at last.
I'm glad you like it.
You'll have to be pretty good to beat me. I'll open for 100.
Nevertheless, I'll raise you 100.
Too good for me.
I'm afraid I'll have to raise you 100.
Well, you must have something pretty good.
Still...
Excuse me.
Still... I'll raise you 100.
Sorry to see you lose your money, but I can't let that challenge go unanswered.
And 100.
Well, you're making me very nervous.
But I must raise you 200.
A Pike doesn't know the meaning of the word "fear". And 100.
A Harrington doesn't know the meaning of the word "defeat". And 200.
What are you doing? Oh, I'm so sorry.
I thought I'd given you six cards. Far from it, my little minx.
Far from it.
And 100.
I wonder if I have enough money.
Oh, yes, plenty, plenty.
I'll raise you 1,000.
I don't want to win so much from you, but I'll call you just to show you how hopeless it is.
Cards?
Not unless you have another queen, which I doubt.
Well, I'll see what I can do.
What do you know about that? I thought at least one of you had four aces.
I'll check my four queens. What have you?
I regret to say that I was bluffing.
Spare me the shame of showing you on what.
Oh, say, I'm embarrassed. - Maybe I should have laid my cards down.
You don't think he minds? Father loves to lose.
How do you stand now?
Oh, just about $1,000 behind.
You're going to stop right there. I'll meet you on a-deck in five minutes.
But I want your word of honor that you won't play even one more hand.
You have it.
Know any more games, Harry?
Wonderful girl.
Yes, isn't she?
I, uh... I don't know whether you noticed, but, uh...
If you have no objections, it was...
It was my intention to, uh, ask Miss Harrington...
I mean, your daughter... to, uh, be mine.
Why, my dear boy! You see me astonished! Why, that was the last thing that entered my mind.
Bless my soul. We must have a drink on that.
Steward, two drinks.
Well, I'm all emotional.
Thank you, sir.
To say that I am thunderstruck is an understatement. She'll probably turn you down, but anyway...
I intend to make her as happy as I can.
She asks very little.
I suppose you know I'm very rich.
Aren't we all?
I'm sorry in a way because it would be so pleasant... to buy lovely "nonsensities" for somebody who'd never had them. Wouldn't it?
That's the tragedy of the rich. They don't need anything.
As a matter of fact, Charles, I don't even like winning $1,000 from you...
Oh, my dear sir, it isn't a drop in the ocean.
Why, every time the clock ticks, 14 people swig a bottle of Pike. I don't know why, but there you are.
It's the principle of the thing that bothers me. A father who wins from his own son-in-law, how does that look?
Here, let's wipe out that 1,000. Double or nothing.
Well, I promised Jean I wouldn't play anymore.
This isn't playing. This is undoing an absurdity.
Here, $1,000. High card takes it. Go ahead.
Why... Well...
Darn it all. Now we'll have to try again.
That's 2,000 I owe you. - For the moment.
I wish you wouldn't do that. I'm sure if you tried once more...
No, thanks. I'd rather pay 32,000 than lose a really large amount.
This is very embarrassing. Just make it out to cash.
It could be even more embarrassing.
Thirty-two thousand... dollars... and no cents.
Uh, don't mention the middle name. I wouldn't wantJean to know it.
As a matter of fact, I'd prefer if you wouldn't tell Jean anything about the whole transaction.
You may depend upon it.
You certainly may! - You promised you wouldn't play anymore.
We didn't play anymore, Jean. - We... We were just wiping out my loss.
You need a keeper! Now that you've taught Charles not to play "double or nothing," - what are you Gonna do with that check?
Just this, my pretty child.
You mean it was just a joke?
Why, of course.
You don't actually think I'd bleed my own daughter's friend, do you?
Perish the thought! Come on!
Good night.
Your check, sir.
That was a terrible lesson the colonel almost taught me.
Yeah, he's a great joker.
He certainly had me fooled.
Gee, you look lovely.
Thank you.
I, uh... I spoke to your father about something.
Did you?
Yes.
Would you like to go up in the bow of the boat and stand in the wind?
I'd love to.
The air is good, isn't it? It makes you feel all clean inside and nice. - Don't move.
What?
I've just understood something. Every time I've looked at you here on the boat, it wasn't only here I saw you. You seemed to go way back.
I know that isn't clear, but I saw you here, and at the same time further away, then still further away;
and then very small, like converging perspective lines.
That isn't it. It's like...
like people following each other in a forest glade.
Only way back there you're a little girl with a short dress and your hair... falling to your shoulders, and a little boy is standing, holding your hand.
In the middle distance, I'm still with you, not holding your hand anymore because it isn't manly, but wanting to.
And then still further, we look terrible. You with your legs like a colt and mine like a calf.
What I'm trying to say is... only I'm not a poet, I'm an ophiologist...
I've always loved you. I mean, I've never loved anyone but you.
I know that sounds dull as a drugstore novel, and what I see inside I'll never be able to cast into words, but that's what I mean.
I wish we were married and on our honeymoon now.
So do I. But it isn't as simple as all that, Hopsie.
I'm terribly in love, and you seem to be too. So one of us has to think and try and keep things clear.
Maybe I can do that better than you can.
They say a moonlit deck is a woman's business office.
Are you the purser? - Just a moment.
Mr. Klink, please. - You the purser?
Yes. What is it, please?
I want to ask you a"hypothermical" question.
Maybe that would be better to ask the doctor.
Never mind the wisecracks. What I want the dope on is, if there happened to be card sharks on this tub...
Shh! Not so loud, please. In the first place, there isn't any, and...
Could you prove it if there was?
A passenger is a passenger, my friend. If he pays for his ticket and doesn't steal the ship's towels, who are we to go slandering him?
You don't happen to be a mouthpiece?
You talk like a law school. I was admitted to the BAR, if that's what you're talking about.
The drinks are on you. I watch out for the kid, the Pike kid.
I watch out for him, and you're gonna watch out for him, or you'll be right on the beach selling' popcorn.
His old man knows your president. A wire from me is all it takes. When old man Pike goes into action, you'll be in the side pocket.
All I gotta do... - You needn't try to intimidate me, Mr...
Murgatroyd to you.
Troygamoyd. If I should discover that Mr. Pike was in any danger of being swindled,
I might have some photographs... confidential, of course... of some of the better known alleged professional card players.
Not that I admit there are any on this ship. You understand?
Naw, they're swimming alongside in the water.
Come in.
Good morning. - Good morning, Harry.
Think you're pretty smart, don't you?
You know I had to.
You're such an old scoundrel. You'd skin me if you had the chance. Aren't you ashamed of yourself?
Are you really in love with this mug? - Uh-huh.
Don't you think it a little dangerous? I don't mean for us, for your heart.
They're apt to be slightly narrow-minded, these righteous people.
A man who couldn't forgive wouldn't be much of a man.
What about his family?
You're going to tell him who we are before you marry him?
I presume he's offered you marriage. - Of course he did.
And you're going to tell him?
But you're not going to tell him till you get off the boat. You'd have to be fair to Gerald and to me.
Naturally.
I hope you'll never be unhappy.
I hope I'll never be more unhappy than I am right now.
He's waiting for you? - Uh-huh.
And you're in a hurry to get to him? - Uh-huh!
Then I'll leave you.
Good morning.
Oh, what do you want?
How much did you lose last night? - Nothing.
Why? - You see?
There's something screwy somewhere.
Sherlock Holmes! What's the matter, did you lose?
The guy lets me win a few fish.
So you get twice as suspicious? - That's right?
You ought to put handles on that skull.
Maybe you could grow geraniums in it.
Yeah? Well, get a load of this and see what you can grow in it.
Gratitude! That's what you get for savin' a guy's life.
Philo Vance!
If you didn't lose any money last night, I would prefer you didn't look in there.
I didn't lose any.
There's only one other possibility. They might be aiming at higher game.
What are you talking about?
You haven't fallen in love, have you?
What's it got to do with you?
Look at the photograph. I'll take the consequences. Good morning, sir.
Straight scotch. - Yes, sir.
Why, Hopsie! What are you doing at the bar at this hour?
Good morning.
Morning, darling.
You look like the last grave over near the willow.
Are you worried about something?
Should I be?
Of course you should, falling in love with a girl in the middle of an ocean.
You see, Hopsie, you don't know very much about girls.
The best ones aren't as good as you probably think they are, and the bad ones aren't as bad. Not nearly as bad.
You're right to worry, falling in love with an adventuress on the high seas.
Are you an adventuress?
All women are. They have to be.
If you waited for a man to propose, you'd die of old maidenhood.
That's why I let you try my slippers on, and then I put my cheek against yours;
then I made you put your arms around me, and then I...
I fell in love with you, which wasn't in the cards.
Jean.
Yes, darling?
What's that?
You'd better look.
Rotten likeness, isn't it?
I never cared for that picture. Good morning.
Breakfast?
Melon, grapefruit, orange juice?
Just some coffee, please.
Please don't look so upset. I was going to tell you when we got to New York.
I would have told you, only it wouldn't have been fair to Harry and Gerald.
You never know how someone's going to take things like that.
And... well... maybe I wanted you to love me a little more too.
You believe me, don't you?
You don't think I was going to marry you without telling you?
You don't think that badly of me.
Or do you?
Why didn't you let your father rob me last night?
If you didn't believe what I just told you, you wouldn't believe that either.
You wouldn't understand. Anyway, I'm...
I'm glad you got the picture this morning instead of last night, if that means anything to you.
You thought you were having a lot of fun with me, didn't you?
L... I was having a lot of fun with you, Hopsie. More fun than I've ever had with anybody.
You were certainly very funny showing Harry how to palm a card.
You were pretty funny yourself.
When?
Trying to play me for a sucker when they told me who you were the morning after I met you.
Who told you? - Never mind who told me.
You mean you were playing me for a sucker?
I don't believe it.
But if you were...
If you were just trying to make me feel cheap and hurt me,
you succeeded handsomely.
You ought to be very proud of yourself, Mr. Pike. Very proud of yourself.
Your coffee, miss!
There, there, there. My gracious!
You know you shouldn't draw to an inside straight.
I hate that mug. I hate him!
When I think we let that sucker off scot-free, it makes my blood boil!
I told you not to mix business.
I won't again, believe me.
Scot-free" is perhaps an exaggeration.
How did you do it?
Don't you remember he showed me how to palm things?
With two strokes of a hot iron, it'll come out like new.
I feel a lot better already.
Come on, baby! Roll, you sweet pappy! Roll them heels!
He took it too wide.
He'll be all right.
In a pig's neck, he'll be all right. - Come on, pappy!
Pappy needs them pennies!
Keep it down to a riot!
Oh, baby, don't do that!
What I can't understand is how he finished fifth!
There were only five horses in the race. What do you expect when you bet on a goat called "After You"?
Pardon me, but is this seat taken?
My dear Harry! Bless my soul!
William at the moment.
William, of course.
I'm enchanted to see you again, My dear William.
And you, Gerald. - And the lady pretty as a pack of aces.
Hello, Pearlie.
Sir Alfred at the moment, my pretty child.
Sir Alfred McGlennan Keith at your service.
You're certainly a sight for lame peepers. I've seen nobody, absolutely not a soul in our set, since the boat stopped running.
What's your pitch, Pearlie?
Sir Alfred. I have a little nest on the edge of a town called Bridgefield, a town that's full of millionaires.
It's in the heart of the contract bridge belt, a wonderful game!
Bridgefield, Connecticut?
Precisely. I have my dogs. I have my horses.
We play a little game here and a little game there, then we play somewhere else.
Sometimes my luck is good. Sometimes my luck is better.
One thing and another, what a dream! - How do you meet them?
The chumps?
When one's name is Sir Alfred McGlennan Keith, R.F.D., one doesn't have to meet them.
One fights them off with sticks. Then again, just think, there's no hurry! - You have them by the year like a lease.
Ah, Pearlie.
Tell me, do you know the Pikes?
What do you care if he does?
Oh, do I know them? I positively swill in their ale. Good old Horace.
Do you know Charles?
Is he the tall, backward boy who's always toying with toads and things?
I think I have seen him skulking about.
He isn't backward. - He's a scientist.
Oh, is that what it was? I knew he was... peculiar.
Well, it's charming to have seen you again. Now, what have we in the fifth?
Say, Pearlie. - Yeah?
Could I visit you sometime?
Could you visit me sometime?
As your niece.
As my niece?
My dear girl, you have to be English.
I've been English before.
I shall be as English as necessary.
Why don't you stop talking nonsense?
Because I want to see that guy. I've got some unfinished business with him.
I need him like the axe needs the turkey!
Better go make your bets.
# Come, landlord fill the flowing bowl # # Until it doth run over #
# For tonight we'll merry, merry be # # For tonight we'll merry, merry be #
# For tonight we'll merry, merry be #
# Tomorrow we'll be sober ##
Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah, that's right.
Black tie or white tie?
You can wear a green one for all I care.
What party is that? Who's giving it?
We are!
Well, it's funny they wouldn't say something to me about it.
Yeah, this is Mr. Pike speaking. Mr. Who?
I don't get it.
I'll probably meet you at the party tonight anyhow.
By the way, what time is it?
Thanks.
Nuthouse.
Hey, where is everybody?
Where's my breakfast?
Crest:
A lion couchant gardant or... holding between the paws an escutcheon sable charged with a cock proper.
Motto: Hyphen sic erat in fatis."
Here, you do it. - Nonsense!
It's perfectly simple.
Second or third, a fesse dancette, between three crosses crosslet.
Crosses crosslet.
That's right.
Horses horselet!
Emile!
Nutzes nutslet! Wit gules!
Remember who you are!
Yes, sir?
When do I eat?
They must have overlooked you. I'll get you something right away.
It's about time.
You'll regret this day, my lad!
Fusils!
Oh, that's all very well.
Fitchee! Fitchee!
Where's the snake food?
Oh, get it yourself, Ambrose!
Lay off the Ambrose.
Why didn't you shave in your room?
Keep your remarks to yourself. - What's the matter with him?
Fitchee!
Where's the snake food?
In the icebox. Where do you think it is?
What's the matter with everybody?
The master's breakfast, please.
You can take it up with somebody else.
What did I do?
Hey, you! - Huh?
Come here.
While you're inside... No speak.
Ohhh!
If that's the knife sharpener, take him around to the back.
Yes, ma'am.
You just sit there, and I'll be back before you can say...
Piano? - What do you want?
Where's the piano, kindly?
Where do you think it is?
I'll show you.
And don't forget to come back. - Say, Burrows.
Yes, sir.
Good morning, sir.
You haven't seen a little brown crotalis colobrinus, have you?
With pink spots.
I rejoice to say that I have not, sir.
That's all I'd be needing this morning. Thank you, sir.
Okay. And try and keep off the grass.
Where'd you get that thing?
Good evening, my man.
How are you? - Uh... - Come on, lady.
We're holding up the traffic.
Come, my dear.
Right you are, Glenny.
And keep off the grass. Next!
Just here, Your Ladyship.
Good evening, Burrows.
Your Ladyship.
Your Ladyship.
The Lady Eve Sidwich... and Sir Alfred McGlennan Keith.
Welcome, my dear.
Good evening.
Sir Alfred.
Hello, hello, hello!
How are you, Glenny? Glad to see you, you old rascal.
Horace, my lad.
My niece Lady Sidwich.
How do you do? Well, this is a surprise, miss, uh...
Say, what do I call you?
Well, Horace, I should think you'd know.
Oh, please. Just call me Eve.
Just plain Eve.
Isn't that wonderful?
You're just the kind of a girl I've been looking for all my life.
We'll get this over with quick, and you and I will have a little drink.
Ripping! Just the word for it.
Come on.
I hope Horace won't frighten her to death.
How long has she been in America?
Three days. - Three days, and to meet Horace right away. - Oh, I don't know.
How did she come over?
I didn't know the boats were running.
A battleship.
A battleship?
Well, actually, a cruiser.
But then she must be very, very...
Oh, very!
Well!
Naturally, I was frightfully anxious to see Uncle Alfred, and as I didn't know just where Connect-i-cut was...
I took the tube.
The subway.
And to the official, I said, "Be so good as to let me off at Connect-i-cut".
You see, I thought we'd have the boxes... sent up on a dray later that afternoon.
The what?
Trunks on a truck.
So he said, " Lady, I don't know where Connect-i-cut is, but this train goes to Harlem".
But I don't know how he knew I was a lady!
So I said, "Do you think I'd do better on a tram?"
And he said, "Well, now, uh... you couldn't do worse".
So I thanked him and returned to the street. Oh, but I must say I felt an awful fool!
Then how did you get here?
I took a taxi.
From New York?
Oh, Charlie, I want you to meet Lady Eve Sidwich.
How do you do?
Go on. The chauffeur said it wasn't far, so I said, "Very well". - But the city seemed enormous!
At 20 cents a mile!
Isn't your son feeling well? - What's the matter with you?
Well...
I mean to say, uh... haven't we met?
But of course we have! Your father just introduced us.
Aren't you feeling well?
Uh... sure.
Oh, I'm so sorry. You meant, hadn't you met me before someplace.
Yes.
Very probably. Let me see.
Where could it have been? - Deauville?
Biarritz?
No. No.
I know! Le Touquet!
You had a moustache at the time, and you tried to meet me in the casino.
No. - Huh.
I give up.
Let's have a drink.
It couldn't have been on the S.S. Southern Queen between here and South America, could it? Oh, I'm afraid not.
You see, I've never been in South America.
You've never been in South America?
She's never been in South America.
As a matter of fact, I've never been in North America until about three days ago.
Oh, you haven't? Well, you weren't on the S.S. Southern Queen.
Say, what's the matter with you? Oh, uh... I'm sorry.
Oh!
Were you in love with her?
He was in love with her, but he don't remember what she looked like. Don't let them tease you.
You can tell me all about her.
Well, on some days my son seems brighter than others.
Well, I don't know what she looked like, but if she looked anything like you, here's to her.
Thank you.
It was a white one with enormous teeth!
Dinner is served, madam.
Thank you, Burrows. Dinner, Horace. Oh.
Come on. Let's put on the feed bag. Take my arm, and we'll fight our way through.
Charming. Simply charming.
Did you hurt yourself?
No, I'm fine.
Oh. - I just...
You haven't been hitting the bottle lately, have you?
Of course he hasn't. Anybody's apt to trip.
Not over a sofa. That sofa's been there for 15 years, and no one ever fell over it before.
Oh, well, now the ice is broken.
You go upstairs and take a bath, and I'll like you just as much as ever. There's a good boy.
Toodle-oo!
So long.
That's the same dame.
She looks the same, she walks the same... and she's tossing you just like she done the last time.
She doesn't talk the same.
Anybody can put on an act.
Guess who I am.
Weren't her eyes closer together? - They were not.
They were right where they are, on each side of her nose.
Why should she do it?
I don't know. Maybe she wants you to fall for her again.
Do I look that dumb? - You wouldn't be the first one. I knew a guy married the same dame three times, then turned around and married her aunt.
No. - Huh? - They look too much alike.
You said it. There couldn't be two...
They look too much alike to be the same.
That's what I've been telling you.
If she came here with her hair dyed yellow and eyebrows different or...
What's hair to a skirt?
I used to go with a little Eskimo dame...
She didn't dye her hair, and she didn't pretend she'd never seen me before.
She says I look familiar.
Why shouldn't you?
Because if I did, she wouldn't admit it.
If she didn't look so exactly like the other girl, I might be suspicious.
You don't understand psychology. If you wanted to pretend you were someone else, you'd glue a muff on your chin, and the dog wouldn't even bark at you.
You tryin' to tell me this ain't the same rib was on the boat?
She even wears the same perfume!
I don't know.
It's the same dame.
Oh, there he is!
I had to change my coat.
Well, don't knock the table over.
All right now?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Thanks. Happens to the best of us, you know. I remember a night in Bombay.
Have you ever been in Bombay?
You're just there.
I've been in Egypt.
I remember a night in Egypt. I was with a small party of friends, and one day, while shooting crocodiles...
You missed some very nice soup.
That's too bad. - The fish was a poem.
That's fine.
Did you hear how the Lady Eve got to this country?
How? - You must promise not to tell a soul.
I won't.
In a submarine. No!
Is that so?
Do you know that I find your son very handsome?
No! Hmm!
Why don't you look where you're goin'?
Why don't you keep your nose out of other people's business?
Quiet! - For two cents, I'd smack you right...
Oh, pish tush!
Why don't you look where... Here, give me that.
What do you mean?
So the deaf man said, "What did you say?"
And the other passenger said...
I hear you buried your wife".
So the deaf man said, "I didn't quite hear you".
Over here.
What do you think you're doing in the dining room?
What does it look like I'm doing?
So sorry, sir.
It's about time.
And then the other passenger said...
Ladies first. I'm so sorry.
I thought he was passing it to me.
Will you throw that roughneck out of here, or will I have to?
With enthusiasm, sir.
That's the same dame. I can tell by the way...
I'll take over from here, Mr. Murgatroyd.
You and who else?
I said, I'll take over from here, Ambrose.
Ambrose"?
I said I'll take over.
I said I'll take over from here. You have no right in this room.
Well, I'll be!
Oh, I'm so sorry, sir.
Excuse me.
Oh, dear! Again?
Why don't you put on a bathing suit?
And then the countryman said, "But dash it all, mister. "If I muss the moss, I'll miss the mass.
And I've never been behind before, besides".
It was absolutely priceless!
Ripping! - You mean top-hole.
There you are, laddie, and very nice too. Did you purchase it locally?
It's the last one. Anything happens to this, I'll have to wear a bath towel.
Oh, don't let it depress you, laddie. Worse things happen in the best families.
I remember an incident in Calcutta...
I hope your niece doesn't think I'm a half-wit.
Oh, bumble-puppy! Why, she's used to having young men fall for her.
You know, I think that's rather neat for a nobleman.
It's just that this girl on the boat...
There was a girl on a boat?
She looked so exactly like your niece... - Shhh!
Did she have the McGlennan eyes? The cornflower blue?
I think so.
You must never mention a word of this to a soul.
What do you mean? - You're rattling the skeleton.
I'm afraid you've stumbled on the sorrow of Sidwich, the secret of the century.
I don't quite follow.
Meet me in yonder window embrasure, and look as though you know nothing.
You see, the earl was considerably older than her mama, who must never be mentioned again. - Oh.
It was a sort of May/November romance. Even a March/December, if you follow me.
Shhh! She'd die of shame if she thought I told you, except that she doesn't know it herself.
You see, into the gulf that separated this unfortunate couple... there was a coachman on the estate, a gay dog.
A great hand with horses and ladies. - A coachman?
Yes.
A man who drives horses.
I know what a coachman is.
They called him "Handsome Harry".
Handsome Harry? - Shhh!
The father of the girl on the boat.
Of course. The father of the other child. After the divorce, of course.
But they looked exactly alike.
We must close our minds to that fact.
It brings up the dreadful, unfounded suspicion... we must carry to our tombs, as it is utterly untenable, that the coachman in both instances... need I say more?
He did! I mean, he was! - Shhh!
Do you want to bring the walls tumbling down about our ears?
Silence to the grave, and even beyond.
Oh, there you are in your nice white coat.
Would you like to come and talk to me?
I certainly would.
And I want to apologize for seeming clumsy. - Oh, that's quite all right.
As a matter of fact, I rather enjoyed it.
I'm not that way all the time.
Of course you're not. Now where should we go?
Oh, there's a conservatory.
Jolly. Ooh!
What's the matter?
Oh, I'm caught.
I'm glad it's not my fault this time.
There you are.
Entirely disgraceful. I've never seen such a farce in a respectable house.
If I didn't hate him so much, I would've felt sorry for him.
He certainly took some nice falls. And he's gonna take a lot more too.
Do you know why he didn't recognize me?
Yes.
No, you don't. I hardly recognized him myself. He seemed shorter and bonier.
It's because we don't love each other anymore.
You see, on the boat we had an awful yen for each other, so I saw him as very tall and very handsome.
He probably thought I had big melting eyes and a rosebud mouth... and a figure like Miss Long Beach, the dream of the fleet.
So you have, for that matter.
But I took the further precaution of telling him the plot... of"Cecelia, " or " The Coachman's Daughter, " a gaslight melodrama.
No! - Yes.
I've got to protect myself.
I've got a shouting interest round here.
So I filled him full of handsome coachmen, elderly earls... young wives and the two little girls who looked exactly alike.
You mean he actually swallowed that? Like a wolf.
Well, now you've got him, what're you gonna do with him?
Finish what I started.
I'm going to dine with him, dance with him, swim with him, laugh at his jokes, canoodle with him, and then one day about six weeks from now...
Some red roses for Your Ladyship.
Who could they be from?
Mr. Charles Pike, Your Ladyship.
Oh, the brewer's son.
Oh, rather long, aren't they? - Just pop them in the umbrella stand.
Very good, milady.
Thank you.
I'll probably talk like a cockeyed duchess the rest of my life.
It won't even take six weeks.
One day about two weeks from now, we'll be riding in the hills, past waterfalls and mountain greenery, up and down ravines and around through vine-covered trails... till we come to a spot where the scenery will be so gorgeous,
it will rise up and smite me on the head like a hammer.
And the sunset will be so beautiful, I'll have to get off my horse to admire it.
And as I stand there against the glory of Mother Nature, my horse will steal up behind me and nuzzle my hair.
And so will Charles, the heel. - Stop that!
Must I?
Oh, sorry. I thought it was the horse.
No, it was me.
Eve? - Yes, Charles?
I suppose you know what I'm thinking about.
Possibly I have an idea.
The union of two people for life... that is, marriage... shouldn't be taken lightly.
How wise you are!
Men are more careful in choosing a tailor than they are in choosing a wife.
That's probably why they look so funny.
No, they're more careful in choosing a tailor than in choosing a wife.
Oh. But not you, Charles. - That's right.
I think that if there's one time in your life to be careful, to weigh every pro and con, that this is the time.
Oh, yes, you... You can't be too careful.
That's right.
Now, you might think that having known you such a short time... I...
I feel I've known you always.
That's the way I feel about you.
I don't just see you here in front of the sunset, but you seem to go way back.
I see you here and, at the same time, further away and still further away and way, way back... in a long place like a... like a forest glade?
That's right. How did you guess?
Because that's where I see you always. We held hands way, way back.
That's remarkable. That's like telepathy. Ohh.
I can read many of your thoughts.
Well, then I need hardly tell you of the doubts I've had... before I brought myself to speak like this.
You see, Eve, you're so beautiful.
You're so fine. You're so... I don't deserve you.
Oh, but you do, Charles.
If anybody ever deserved me, you do... so richly. - Eve.
Charles.
But you can't do that!
You'll get us all into trouble! You'll jeopardize what has taken me years to build up!
I'll certainly telephone your father.
Did she look pretty?
She did, eh?
Well, thanks, Pearlie.
Very depressing having your own daughter married, and not be there.
Especially under an assumed name. Is that legal?
Seems to be. Women change their names so much anyway, it doesn't seem to matter.
But why did she do it?
Maybe to teach him a lesson. How?
All she said is:
You'll see. Wait till the time comes, and it won't be long now".
And now she's honeymooning on a train with a man she hates.
Maybe she's going to shoot him.
She's afraid of guns.
Maybe she's going to push him out of the window.
No. You can't open a window on a train.
Come in.
Hello.
Hello.
It's cozy, isn't it?
Ohhh, you poor darling! Oh, did you hurt yourself?
Oh, put it right there.
It's all right.
Oh, come sit down. Oh, poor darling.
Are you all right? - Yeah.
What are you laughing at?
It's just that it's so different. - It reminds me of that other time.
What time was that?
Oh, I must be a little bit hysterical.
You see, we didn't have any money, so we went third class, and there was a farmer on the opposite bench with cheese in his lap.
Haven't you ever noticed I never eat cheese?
It was very unromantic.
Where were you going?
We eloped.
Who eloped?
Me.
It was really nothing, darling. I was only 16 at the time. You know how romantic young girls are.
It wasn't of the slightest importance, I assure you. I'm sorry I mentioned it. Let's pretend I didn't.
Kiss me, and that's all there is to it. Now it's all finished, isn't it?
Who did you elope with?
Oh, now I've planted a seed in your mind. Are you sure you want to know?
Oh, why don't we just forget the whole thing?
Who was it?
Angus.
Angus?
Oh, I assure you he was no one of the slightest importance.
Oh, what a way to make me spend the wedding night. Oh, he was just a groom on father's estate.
A groom!
Well, not really the groom, of course.
He put on the groom's uniform on his day off, then he'd be the groom that day. The rest of the time he was just a stable boy.
A stable boy?
Yes, a boy who cleans up the stables. Oh, you don't think much of my choice.
Well, he didn't look so bad in the groom's uniform... with the tight pants, the boots with yellow tops and the little fat silk hat.
Don't you think they're cute? - I do not.
Oh, now you're upset. I never know when to keep my mouth closed. I was always taught to be frank and honest.
It was nothing, darling. We ran away, but they caught us and brought us back. And that's all there was to it.
That's all there was to it, except they discharged him.
Good.
When they brought you back, it was before nightfall, I trust. - Oh, no.
You were out all night?
My dear, it took them weeks to find us.
We'd made up different names at the different inns we stayed at.
Oh, you'd die laughing at some of the names we thought of. I remember there was one...
Yes, I'm sure I would.
Oh, now you're upset.
Eve.
Yes, darling?
If there's one thing that distinguishes a man from a beast, it's the ability to understand, and understanding, forgive.
Surely the qualities of mercy, understanding and sweet forgiveness... - Sweet what?
Sweet forgiveness!
Oh.
I won't conceal from you that I wish this hadn't happened. But it has, and so it has.
A girl of 16 is practically an idiot anyway, so I can't very well blame you for something... that was practically done by somebody else.
I want to thank you for being so frank.
The name of Angus will never cross my lips again, and I hope that you will do likewise.
Now let us smile and be as we were. I knew you'd be that way.
I knew it the moment I saw you standing beside me. I knew you'd be both husband and father to me.
I knew I could trust and confide in you. I suppose that's why I fell in love with you.
Thank you.
I wonder if now would be the time to tell you about Herman. Herman.
Herman?
Who was Herman?
Vernon?
I thought you said Herman!
Vernon was Herman's friend.
What a friend!
Cecil? - It's pronounced "Ceh-cil".
What did you say, dear?
How do you mean Hubert or Herbert?"
They wereJohn's twin cousins. - John!
Who was John?
'Board!
But that's unheard of! That's what lawyers are for! - He says...
Who says?
I don't know.
I naturally presumed it was her lawyer, but he says she says she won't have anything to do with lawyers.
That's entirely irregular!
Well, it's a thought.
I tell you, I won't see any lawyers!
But these things are always handled by lawyers.
This isn't going to be.
This is entirely between my husband and myself. - Poppycock!
What's the matter with you? They want to make a settlement.
They'll give you half when you leave for Reno... and the balance at the end of six weeks.
Name your own price. For once that we have a chance to make some honest money...
Oh, tell him to go peel an eel!
I don't think you realize the beauty of your situation. You're holding a royal flush.
You've got him right by the ears.
You know, I had nothing to do with this arrangement. But now that you're in it, you might as well go...
Will you let me speak with Mr. Pike, please?
She's on the phone. She wants to talk to Mr. Pike.
We can't allow that. That's entirely irregular!
Shut up. Will you talk to her?
I'll rot before I'll talk to her.
Mr. Pike, I advise you against
Lay off! Hello, Eve. This is Horace talking.
Hello, darling.
I'm awfully sorry about the trouble I've made you all.
I thought I had a reason, but now I... Well...
I just wanted to tell you this.
I won't see any lawyers, because there's nothing to see them about. I don't want any money;
I don't want anything. He can have back his jewelry and anything else there is, and I'll go to Reno at my own expense.
I think that's only fair.
There's only one thing I want.
I want to see him first, and I...
I want him to ask me to be free. That's all.
No money, no nothing.
Only he has to come here to ask me, because... well, there's something I want to say to him... before we part.
Just a minute, Eve. All she wants is for you to go to New York and ask her.
It's a trick! - Will you keep out of this?
Well, that's all she wants.
When can you go?
If she's waiting for me to ask her, she can wait till Havana freezes over. - Quite right.
I'll have to call you back, Eve.
He just stepped out of the office for a minute. I'll call you back.
Now you listen, you numbskull!
Go ahead and talk. I'm listening.
Hello? Yes, Horace.
I'm sorry, Eve. He won't do it. I thought it was a pretty fair offer.
As a matter of fact, I think you're a sucker to make it.
But he won't do it.
He seemed very bitter. I'm sorry.
Oh, let me speak to him. Please, Horace!
I don't think he'd talk to you, Eve. And anyway, he's gone to say good-bye to his mother.
Where is he going?
Why, Hopsie!
Hopsie?
Hopsie.
Jean!
I'm sorry, but if you knew what it meant to me to find you again. - Can we go to your cabin or someplace?
Now just a minute.
Oh, Colonel, I'm delighted to see you again. We must play cards this trip.
Steward, some champagne for the colonel.
Certainly, Mr. Pike.
You really haven't the right to drag me off like this, Hopsie.
Are you sure we're on the right boat, Sylvester?
Oh, why didn't you take me in your arms that day? Why did you let me go? Why did we have to go through all this nonsense?
Don't you know you're the only man I ever loved?
Don't you know I couldn't look at another man if I wanted to?
Don't you know I waited all my life for you, you big mug?
Will you forgive me?
For what?
Oh, you mean on the boat. The question is, can you forgive me?
What for?
Oh, you still don't understand.
I don't want to understand. I don't want to know. Whatever it is, keep it to yourself.
All I know is, I adore you. I'll never leave you again. We'll work it out somehow.
There's just one thing. I feel it's only fair to tell you. It would never have happened except she looked like you.
I have no right to be in your cabin.
Why? - Because I'm married.
But so am I, darling. So am I.
Positively the same dame!
Yes, sweetheart?
There's a girl wants to see you. Her name's Wonderly.
A customer?
I guess so. You'll want to see her, anyway. She's a knockout.
Shoo her in, Effie, darling. Shoo her in.
Will you come in, Miss Wonderly?
Thank you.
Won't you sit down, Miss Wonderly?
Thank you.
I inquired at the hotel for the name of a reliable private detective. They mentioned yours.
Suppose you tell me about it from the very beginning.
I'm from New York.
I'm trying to find my sister.
I have reason to believe that she's here in San Francisco with a man by the name of Thursby, Floyd Thursby.
I don't know where she met him.
We've never been as close as sisters ought to be.
If we had, perhaps Corinne would have told me that she was planning on running away with him.
Mother and Father are in Honolulu. It would kill them.
I've got to find her before they get back home. They're coming home the first of the month.
You've had word of your sister?
A letter from her about two weeks ago. It said nothing except that she was all right.
I sent her a telegram, begging her to come home.
I sent it to General Delivery here. That was the only address she gave me.
I waited a week and no answer came, so I decided to come out here myself.
I wrote her that I was coming. I shouldn't have done that, should I?
It's not always easy to know what to do. You haven't found her?
No. I told her in my letter that I'd be at the St. Mark and for her to meet me there.
I waited three whole days. She didn't come. Didn't even send a message.
It was horrible, waiting.
I sent her another letter to General Delivery. Yesterday afternoon, I went to the post office.
Corinne didn't call for her mail, but Floyd Thursby did.
He wouldn't tell me where Corinne was.
He said she didn't want to see me.
I can't believe that.
He promised to bring her to the hotel, if she'd come, this evening.
He said he knew she wouldn't.
Excuse me.
It's all right, Miles. Come in.
Miss Wonderly, my partner, Miles Archer.
Miss Wonderly's sister ran away from New York with a fellow named Floyd Thursby.
They're here in San Francisco.
Miss Wonderly has seen Thursby and has a date to meet him tonight. Maybe he'll bring the sister with him.
The chances are he won't.
Miss Wonderly wants us to find the sister, get her away from him and back home.
Right? - Yes.
Now, it's simply a matter of having a man at the hotel this evening to shadow him when he leads us to your sister.
If, after we've found her, she still doesn't want to leave him,
well, we have ways of managing that.
Yeah.
But you must be careful. I'm deathly afraid of him, of what he might do.
She's so young, and his bringing her here from New York is such a serious...
Mightn't he do something to her?
Now, just leave that to us. We'll know how to handle him.
But I want you to know he's a dangerous man. I honestly don't think he'd stop at anything.
I don't think he'd hesitate to kill Corinne if he thought it would save him.
Could he cover up by marrying her?
He has a wife and three children in England.
Yes, they usually do, though not always in England. What's he look like?
He has dark hair and thick, bushy eyebrows.
He talks in a loud, blustery manner. He gives the impression of being a violent person.
He was wearing a light gray suit and a gray hat when I saw him this morning.
What does he do for a living?
I haven't the faintest idea.
What time's he coming to see you?
After 8:00.
All right, Miss Wonderly. We'll have a man there.
I'll look after it myself.
Thank you.
Oh, yes.
Will that be enough? - Thank you.
Not at all.
It'll help some if you meet Thursby in the lobby.
I will.
You don't have to look for me. - I'll see you all right.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
Goodbye.
They're right enough.
They have brothers in her bag.
What do you think of her?
She's sweet.
Maybe you saw her first, Sam, but I spoke first.
You've got brains.
Yes, you have.
Hello?
Yeah. Speaking.
Miles Archer dead?
Where?
Bush and Stockton? Yeah.
In 15 minutes.
Thanks.
Hello, Effie? It's me.
Now, listen, precious.
Miles has been shot.
Yeah, dead.
Now, don't get excited.
Yeah.
Now, you'll have to break the news to Iva. I'd fry first.
And keep her away from me.
That's a good girl.
Now get right over there.
You're an angel.
Bye.
What do you want here?
I'm Sam Spade. Tom Polhaus phoned.
I didn't know you at first. They're back there.
Hello, Sam. I figured you'd want to see it before we took him away.
Thanks, Tom. What happened?
Got him right through the pump with this.
It's a Webley. English, ain't it? Yeah.
A Webley-Fosbery .45 automatic, 8-shot. They don't make them anymore.
How many gone out of it?
Just one.
Let's see. Shot up here, huh?
Standing like you are, with his back to the fence.
The man who shot him stood here.
Went over backwards, taking the top of the fence with him, and went on down the hill and got caught on that rock. That it?
That's it. The blast burnt his coat.
Who found him?
Man on the beat.
Anybody hear the shot?
Somebody must've. We just got here.
You want to go down and have a look at him before we take him away?
No, you've seen everything I could.
His gun was still tucked away on his hip. Hadn't been fired.
His overcoat was buttoned.
I found a $100 bill in his vest pocket and 30 some bucks in his pants.
Was he working, Sam? Well?
He was tailing a guy named Thursby. - What for?
What for?
He wanted to find out where he lived. Don't crowd me, Tom.
I'm going on down and break the news to Miles' wife.
It's tough, him getting it like that, ain't it?
Miles had his faults, just like any of the rest of us, but I guess he must've had some good points, too, huh?
I guess so.
Miss Wonderly, please.
Checked out?
What time?
Any forwarding address?
Thanks.
Hello, Tom. Hello, Lieutenant. Come in.
Sit down.
Sit down.
Drink?
Did you break the news to Miles' wife, Sam?
How'd she take it?
I don't know anything about women.
Since when?
What kind of a gun do you carry?
None. I don't like them. Course, there are some at the office.
You don't happen to have one here?
You sure about that?
Look around. Turn the dump upside down if you want to. I won't squawk if you got a search warrant.
We don't want to make any... I don't like this!
Why are you birds sucking around here for?
Tell me or get out.
You can't treat us like that, Sam. It ain't right. We got our work to do.
Why were you tailing Thursby?
I wasn't. Miles was and for the simple reason we had a client...
Who's the client?
Sorry, I can't tell you that.
Be reasonable, Sam. Give us a break, will you?
How we gonna turn up anything on Miles' killing if you don't tell us what you got?
Tom says you were in too much of a hurry to even stop and take a look at your dead partner.
And you didn't go to Archer's house to tell his wife.
We called your office and the girl there said you told her to do it.
I'll give you 10 minutes to get to a phone and do your talking to the girl.
I'll give you 10 minutes to get to Thursby's joint,
Geary and Leavenworth. You could do it easily in that time.
What's your boyfriend getting at, Tom?
Just this, Thursby was shot down in front of his hotel about a half an hour after you left Bush Street.
Keep your paws off me.
What time did you get home?
Just a few minutes ahead of you. I was walking around thinking things over.
We know you weren't here. We tried to get you on the phone. - Where did you walk to?
Up Bush Street.
Did you see anybody...
No. No witnesses.
Well, I know where I stand, now.
Sorry I got up on my hind legs, boys, but you fellas trying to rope me made me nervous.
Miles getting bumped off upset me, and then you birds cracking foxy.
But it's all right now, now that I know what it's all about.
Forget it, Sam.
Thursby die? - Yeah.
How'd I kill him?
He was shot in the back four times with a .44 or .45 from across the street.
Nobody saw it, but that's how it figures.
Hotel people know anything about him?
Nothing, except that he lived there a week.
Alone?
Yeah, alone.
Did you find out who he was? What his game was? Well, did you?
We thought you could tell us that.
I've never seen Thursby, dead or alive.
Well, you know me, Spade.
If you did it, or if you didn't, you'll get a square deal from me and most of the breaks.
Don't know as I'd blame you much. The man that killed your partner...
But that won't stop me from nailing you.
Fair enough.
But I'd feel better about it if you'd have a drink with me.
Success to crime.
She's in there.
I told you to keep her away from me.
Yes, but you didn't tell me how.
Don't be cranky with me, Sam. I've had her all night.
Sorry, angel. I didn't mean...
Hello, Iva.
Sam.
Darling. Effie take care of everything? I think so.
Sam, did you kill him?
Who put that bright idea in your head?
Well, I thought you said if it wasn't for Miles, you'd...
Be kind to me, Sam.
You killed my husband, Sam. Be kind to me."
Don't, Iva. Don't.
You shouldn't have come here today, darling. You ought to be home.
You'll come soon?
Soon as I can. Goodbye, Iva.
Well, how did you and the widow make out?
She thinks I shot Miles.
So you could marry her?
The cops think I killed Thursby, the guy Miles was tailing for that Wonderly dame.
Who do you think I shot?
Are you going to marry Iva?
Don't be silly. I wish I'd never laid eyes on her.
Do you suppose she could have killed him?
You're an angel. A nice, rattlebrained, little angel.
Oh, am I? - Thanks, honey.
Suppose I told you that your Iva hadn't been home many minutes when I arrived to break the news at 3:00 this morning?
Are you telling me?
She kept me waiting at the door while she undressed.
Her clothes were on a chair where she'd dumped them, hat and coat underneath.
Her slip, on top, was still warm.
She'd wrinkled up the bed, but the wrinkles weren't mashed down.
You're a detective, darling, but she didn't kill him.
Do the police really think you shot this what's-his-name?
Do they?
Look at me, Sam. You worry me.
You always think you know what you're doing, but you're too slick for your own good.
Someday you're going to find it out. Spade and Archer.
Yes, Miss Wonderly.
Hello?
Yeah, this is Sam Spade.
Where?
Coronet Apartments, California Avenue, apartment 1001.
What's the name?
Miss LeBlanc.
Okay, I'll be right over.
Have Miles' desk moved out of the office and have "Spade and Archer" taken off all the doors and windows and have "Samuel Spade" put on.
Come in, Mr. Spade.
Everything's upside down.
I haven't finished unpacking. Sit down.
Mr. Spade, I...
I have a terrible, terrible confession to make.
That story I told you yesterday was just a story.
Well, we didn't exactly believe your story, Miss...
What is your name, Wonderly or LeBlanc?
It's really O'Shaughnessy. Brigid O'Shaughnessy.
We didn't exactly believe your story, Miss O'Shaughnessy. - We believed your $200.
You mean that...
I mean you paid us more than if you'd been telling us the truth and enough more to make it all right.
Tell me, Mr. Spade, am I to blame for last night?
You warned us that Thursby was dangerous.
Of course, you lied to us about your sister and all that, but that didn't count. We didn't believe you.
No, I wouldn't say that you were at fault.
Thank you.
Mr. Archer was so alive yesterday, - so solid and hearty, and...
Stop it.
He knew what he was doing. Those are the chances we take.
Was he married?
Yeah, with $10,000 insurance, no children and a wife that didn't like him.
Please don't.
That's the way it was.
Anyway, there's no time for worrying about that now.
Out there's a flock of policemen and assistant district attorneys running around with their noses to the ground.
Mr. Spade, do they know about me?
Not yet. I've been stalling them until I could see you.
Do they have to know about me?
I mean, can't you shield me so that I won't have to answer their questions?
Maybe, but I gotta know what it's all about.
I can't tell you.
I can't tell you now.
I will later, when I can.
You've got to trust me, Mr. Spade.
I'm so alone and afraid.
I've got nobody to help me if you won't help me.
Be generous, Mr. Spade.
You're brave. You're strong.
You can spare me some of that courage and strength, surely.
Help me, Mr. Spade. I need help so badly.
I have no right to ask you. I know I haven't, but I do ask you.
Help me.
You won't need much of anybody's help. You're good.
It's chiefly your eyes, I think, and that throb you get in your voice when you say things like, "Be generous, Mr. Spade."
I deserve that.
But the lie was in the way I said it, not at all in what I said.
It's my own fault if you can't believe me now.
Now you are dangerous.
But I'm afraid I'm not going to be able to be of much help to you unless I've got some idea what it's all about.
For instance, I've gotta have some sort of a line on your Floyd Thursby.
I met him in the Orient. We came here from Hong Kong last week. He promised to help me.
He took advantage of my dependence on him to betray me.
Betray you? How? Why did you want him shadowed?
I wanted to find out how far he'd gone, whom he was meeting, things like that.
Did he kill Archer? - Certainly.
He had a Luger in his shoulder holster. Archer wasn't shot with a Luger.
Mr. Spade, you don't think I had anything to do with the death of Mr. Archer?
Did you?
No.
That's good.
Floyd always carried an extra revolver in his overcoat pocket.
Why all the guns?
He lived by them.
The story in Hong Kong is that he first came to the Orient as bodyguard to a gambler who'd had to leave the States.
The gambler had since disappeared, and Floyd knew about the disappearance. I don't know.
I do know he always went heavily armed, and that he never went to sleep without covering the floor around his bed with crumpled newspapers so that nobody could come silently into his room.
You picked a nice sort of a playmate.
Only that sort could have helped me, if he'd been loyal.
How bad a spot are you actually in?
Bad as could be.
Physical danger?
I'm not heroic.
I don't think there's anything worse than death.
Then it's that?
It's that, as surely as we're sitting here.
Unless you help me.
Who killed Thursby, your enemies or his?
I don't know.
His, I suppose. I'm afraid. I don't know.
This is hopeless.
I don't know what you want done. I don't even know if you know what you want done.
You won't go to the police?
Go to them? All I got to do is stand still, and they'll be swarming all over me.
All right, I'll tell them all I know, and you'll have to take your chances.
You've been patient with me. You've tried to help me. It's useless and hopeless, I suppose.
I do thank you for what you've done. I'll have to take my chances.
How much money have you got?
I've got about $500 left.
Give it to me.
There's only $400 here.
I had to keep some to live on.
Well, can't you get some more?
No.
Haven't you got anything you can raise some money on?
I've got some furs and a little jewelry.
You'll have to hock them.
There you are. I'll be back as soon as I can with the best news I can manage.
I'll ring four times, long, short, long, short.
And no, you needn't bother to come to the door. I'll let myself in.
Anything stirring?
Did you send the flowers?
You're invaluable, darling. Say, get my lawyer on the phone, will you?
Hello, Sid?
I think I'm going to have to tell a coroner to go to blazes, Sid.
Hey, can I hide behind the sanctity of my client's identity, secrets and what-nots all the same, priest or lawyer?
Yeah, I know, but Dundy's getting a little rambunctious, and maybe it is a bit thick this time.
Yeah. What'll it cost to be on the safe side?
Well, maybe it's worth it. Okay, go ahead.
Gardenia.
Quick, darling, in with him.
Will you come in, Mr. Cairo?
Will you sit down, Mr. Cairo?
Thank you, sir.
Now, what can I do for you, Mr. Cairo?
May a stranger offer condolences for your partner's unfortunate death?
Thanks.
Is there, Mr. Spade, as the newspapers imply, a certain relationship between that unfortunate happening and the death a little later of the man Thursby?
I beg your pardon. No.
More than idle curiosity prompted my question.
See, Mr. Spade, I'm trying to recover an ornament that, shall we say, has been mislaid.
I thought and hoped you could assist me.
The ornament is a statuette, a black figure of a bird.
I am prepared to pay, on behalf of the figure's rightful owner, the sum of $5,000 for its recovery.
I am prepared to promise that, what is the phrase? No questions will be asked.
$5,000 is a lot of money.
Yes, Effie?
No, that'll be all. Just be sure to lock the door behind you on your way out.
Good night.
$5,000 is...
You will clasp your hands together at the back of your neck.
I intend to search your offices, Mr. Spade.
I warn you, if you attempt to prevent me, I shall certainly shoot you.
Go ahead and search.
Will you please come to the center of the room?
I have to make certain that you are not armed.
PASSPORT Joel Cairo
Look what you did to my shirt.
Sorry.
But imagine my embarrassment when I found out that $5,000 offer was just hooey.
Mr. Spade, my offer is genuine.
I am prepared to pay $5,000 for the figure's return.
Do you have it? - No.
But if it isn't here, why did you risk serious injury to prevent my searching for it?
Why should I sit around here and let people come in and stick me up?
But certainly it is only natural that I try to save the owner such a considerable expense, if possible.
Who is he?
Mr. Spade, you'll forgive my not answering that question.
Yeah, well, I think we'd be better off all around if we'd put our cards on the table.
No, I do not think it would be better.
You see, Mr. Spade, if you know more than I do, then I shall profit by your knowledge.
So will you, to the extent of $5,000.
There's nothing like $5,000 here.
You want some assurance of my sincerity?
A retainer? Would that do?
It might.
You will take, say, $100?
No. I will take, say, $200.
Now, let's see, your first guess was that I had the bird. There's nothing to that. What's your second guess?
That you know where it is, or at least you know it is where you can get it.
You're not hiring me to do any murders or burglaries, but simply to get it back if possible, in an honest, lawful way?
If possible.
But in any case, with discretion.
When you wish to contact me, sir, I'm staying at the Hotel Belvedere, room 635.
I sincerely expect the greatest mutual benefit from our association, Mr. Spade.
May I please have my gun, now?
Oh, sure. I'd forgotten all about it.
Will you please clasp your hands together at the back of your neck?
I intend to search your offices.
Well, I'll be... Why, sure.
Go ahead. I won't stop you.
Turn to the right and go up the hill, driver.
Okay.
Mr. Spade. Do you bring any news?
I mean, did you manage it so that the police won't have to know about me?
Well, they won't for a while, anyway.
You are wonderful.
You won't get into any trouble, will you?
I don't mind a reasonable amount of trouble.
Do sit down.
You aren't exactly the sort of a person you pretend to be, are you?
Why, I'm not sure I know exactly what you mean.
The schoolgirl manner. You know, blushing, stammering and all that. I haven't lived a good life.
I've been bad.
Worse than you could know.
Yeah, well, that's good, because if you actually were as innocent as you pretend to be, we'd never get anywhere.
I won't be innocent. Good.
By the way, I saw Joel Cairo tonight. - Do you know him?
Only slightly.
You're good. You're very good.
What did he say?
About what?
About me.
Nothing.
What did you talk about then?
He offered me $5,000 for the black bird.
You're not going to go around the room straightening things and poking the fire again, are you?
No, I'm not.
What did you say?
I said $5,000 was a lot of money.
It is.
It's more than I can ever offer you if I have to bid for your loyalty.
That's good coming from you.
What have you ever given me beside money?
You ever given me any of your confidence, any of the truth?
Haven't you tried to buy my loyalty with money and nothing else?
What else is there I can buy you with?
I don't care what your secrets are, but I can't go ahead without more confidence in you than I've got now.
You've got to convince me that you know what this is all about, that you aren't just fiddling around, hoping it'll all come out right in the end.
Can't you trust me a little longer?
How much is a little?
What are you waiting for?
I've got to talk to Joel Cairo.
You can see him tonight. He's at the theater. It'll be out soon.
I'll leave a message at his hotel.
He can't come here. I can't let him know where I am. I'm afraid.
My place, then.
Hello?
I want to leave a message for Joel Cairo. - All right.
You know, I never would've placed myself in this position if I didn't trust you completely.
That again?
Do you know that's true, though?
You don't have to trust me, so long as you can persuade me to trust you.
But don't worry about that now. He'll be along any minute.
You get your business with Cairo over with, then we'll see how we stand.
And you'll let me go about it with him in my own way?
Sure.
You are a godsend.
Well, now don't overdo it.
Mr. Spade, there is a boy outside. He seems to be watching the house.
Yeah, I know. I spotted him. What?
What's that?
What boy?
I don't know. A kid. He's been trailing me all evening.
Did he follow you to my apartment?
No. I shook him long before that.
Come in, Mr. Cairo.
I'm delighted to see you again, madam.
I was sure you would be, Joel.
Mr. Spade told me about your offer for the Falcon.
How soon can you have the money ready?
The money is ready.
In cash?
Yes.
You're ready to pay $5,000 if we turn over the Falcon to you?
Excuse me, please. I must have expressed myself badly.
I did not mean to say that I have the money in my pocket, but that I am ready to get it for you on a few minutes' notice, anytime during banking hours.
That's probably true.
He only had a couple of hundred on him when I searched him late this afternoon at my office.
I shall be able to have the money for you at, say, 10:30 in the morning.
But I haven't got the Falcon.
I'll have it in another week at the most, though.
Then where is it?
Where Floyd hid it.
Floyd hid...
And you know where he hid it? Then why do we have to wait a week?
Perhaps not a whole week.
And why, if I may ask another question, are you willing to sell it to me?
Because I'm afraid.
After what happened to Floyd, I'm afraid to touch it, except to turn it over to somebody else.
What exactly did happen to Floyd?
The fat man. Fat man.
Is he here?
I don't know. I suppose so. What difference does it make?
It might make a world of difference.
But, shall we add, more certainly the boy outside?
Yes.
But you might be able to get around him, Joel, as you did the one in Istanbul.
What was his name?
You mean the one you couldn't get to come to...
This is the second time that you have laid hands on me.
When you're slapped, you'll take it and like it.
Who's that?
I don't know. Keep quiet.
Hello. You guys pick swell hours to do your visiting in.
What is it this time?
We want to talk to you, Spade.
Well, go ahead and talk.
We don't have to do it out here in the hall, do we, Sam?
You can't come in.
Come off it now, Sam.
You aren't trying to strong-arm me, are you, Tom?
Why don't you be reasonable?
It would pay you to play along with us a little, Spade.
You got away with this, and you got away with that, but you can't keep it up forever.
Stop me when you can.
That's what I intend to do.
There's talk going around about you and Archer's wife. - Is there anything to it?
Not a thing.
The talk is that she tried to get a divorce from him so she could put in with you, and he wouldn't give it to her.
Anything to that? - No.
There's even talk that that's why he was put on the spot.
Don't be a hog, Dundy.
Your first idea that I killed Thursby because he killed Miles falls to pieces if you blame me for killing Miles, too.
You haven't heard me say you killed anybody.
You're the one that keeps bringing that up.
Haven't you anything better to do than to keep popping in here early every morning, asking a lot of fool questions?
And getting a lot of lying answers.
Take it easy.
If you say there's nothing between you and Archer's wife, you're a liar and I'm telling you so.
Is that the hot tip that brought you up here at this ungodly hour of the night?
That's one of them.
And the other?
Let us in.
All right, Spade, we'll go.
Maybe you're right in bucking us. Think it over.
Help!
I guess we're going in.
I guess you are.
What's going on in here?
Look, Officer! Look what she did!
Did you do that?
I had to.
I was alone in here with him. He tried to attack me.
I had to keep him off. I couldn't bring myself to shoot him.
You dirty, filthy liar! You...
It isn't true! I came up here in good faith, and then both of them attacked me.
And then when he went out to talk to you, he left her here with a pistol.
And she said as soon as you leave, they are going to kill me, so I called for help because I didn't want you to leave me and be murdered.
And then she struck me with a pistol!
Why don't you make him tell the truth?
Behave yourself, sister.
That's no way to act.
Well, Tom, I don't guess we'll be wrong running the lot of them in.
Don't be in a hurry, boys. Everything can be explained.
I'll bet.
Miss O'Shaughnessy, may I present Lieutenant Dundy and Detective Sergeant Polhaus?
Miss O'Shaughnessy is an operative in my employ since yesterday.
That's a lie, too.
That is Mr. Joel Cairo.
Cairo was an acquaintance of Thursby's.
He came into my office late this afternoon and hired me to find something that Thursby was supposed to have on him when he was bumped off.
It looked funny to me the way he put it, so I wouldn't touch it. Then he pulled a gun on me.
Well, that's neither here nor there, unless we start preferring charges against each other.
Anyway, Miss O'Shaughnessy and I discussed the matter, and we decided to find out exactly how much he knew about Miles' and Thursby's killings, so we asked him to come up here.
Now, maybe we did put the questions to him a little roughly.
You know how that is, Lieutenant.
But we didn't hurt him enough to make him cry for help.
Well, what have you got to say to that?
I don't know what to say.
Try telling the facts. - What?
Facts? - Quit stalling.
All you have to do is swear out a complaint they took a poke at you, and I'll throw them in the can.
Go ahead, Cairo. Tell him, he'll do it.
Then we'll swear out a complaint against you, and he'll have the lot of us.
Get your hats.
Well, boys and girls, we put it over nicely.
Go on, get your hats.
Don't you know when you're being kidded?
No, but that can wait till we get down to the hall.
Wake up, Dundy, you're being kidded.
When I heard the buzzer, I said to Miss O'Shaughnessy and Cairo here, I said, "There's the police again. They're getting to be a nuisance.
When you hear them going, one of you scream, "and then we'll see how far along we can string them until they tumble."
Stop it, Sam!
That cut on his head. How did that get there?
Ask him. Maybe he cut himself shaving.
The cut? No.
When we pretended to be struggling for the gun, I fell over the carpet. I fell.
Horsefeathers.
Take him along, anyway, for packing a gun.
Don't be a sap.
That gun was a plant. It was one of mine.
It's too bad it was only a .25, or maybe you could prove that was the gun that Miles and Thursby were shot with.
No, Sam! No!
Well, then get him out of here.
Get their names and addresses.
My name is Joel Cairo, Hotel Belvedere.
Miss O'Shaughnessy's address is my office.
Where do you live?
Get him out of here! I've had enough...
Now, now. Take it easy, will you, Sam? Is that all you want, Lieutenant?
Yeah.
I think I'll be going now.
What's the hurry, Cairo?
There is no hurry. It's getting quite late, and...
Tell him to leave the gun.
I hope you know what you're doing, Sam.
You're absolutely the wildest, most unpredictable person I've ever known.
Do you always carry on so highhanded?
Well, you've had your talk with Cairo. Now you can talk to me.
Yes, of course.
I'm listening. I'm still listening.
Look at the time. I must be going. - No.
Not till you've told me all about it.
Am I a prisoner?
Maybe the boy outside hasn't gone home yet.
Do you suppose he's still there?
Likely.
You can start now.
You are the most insistent person.
And wild and unpredictable, huh?
Say, what's this bird, this Falcon that everybody's all steamed up about?
Supposing I wouldn't tell you anything about it at all?
What would you do? Something wild and unpredictable?
I might.
It's a black figure, as you know, smooth and shiny, of a bird, a hawk or falcon, about that high.
Here.
What makes it so important?
I don't know. They wouldn't tell me. They offered me £500 if I'd help them get it away from the man who had it.
That was in Istanbul?
Marmara.
Go ahead.
But that's all.
They promised me £500 if I'd help them, and I did.
Then we found out that Joel Cairo intended to desert us, taking the Falcon with him and leaving Floyd and me nothing.
So we did exactly that to him.
Then I wasn't any better off than I was before, because Floyd hadn't any intention of keeping his promise to me about sharing equally.
I'd learned that by the time we got here.
What's the bird made of?
Porcelain or black stone. I don't know. I only saw it once for a few minutes.
Floyd showed it to me when we first got hold of it.
You are a liar.
I am.
I've always been a liar.
Don't brag about it.
Was there any truth at all in that yarn?
Some.
Not very much.
Well, we got all night.
Coffee'll be ready soon. We'll have a cup and try again.
I'm so tired.
So tired of lying and making up lies.
Not knowing what is a lie and what's the truth. I wish...
I want to talk to Mr. Cairo, Joel Cairo.
Thanks.
Where is he?
What?
Where is he?
Who?
Cairo.
What do you think you're doing, Jack, kidding me?
I'll tell you when I am.
New York, aren't you? Shove off.
You're gonna have to talk to me before you're through, sonny.
Some of you will, and you can tell the fat man I said so.
Keep asking for it and you're gonna get it, plenty.
I told you to shove off.
Shove off.
People lose teeth talking like that.
You want to hang around, you'll be polite.
Luke.
Hello, Sam.
Hello, Luke.
Say, that was too bad about Miles. Yeah.
It was a tough break.
I want to show you something.
What do you let these cheap gunmen hang around the lobby for, with their heaters bulging in their clothes?
What do you want here?
Well, if you don't want anything, beat it and don't come back. I won't forget you guys.
What is it? - I don't know.
I just spotted him.
Say, what about Miles? - I'll see you, Luke.
603. - Yes, sir.
Good morning.
Good morning. - There you are, sir.
Let's go someplace where we can talk.
No. Our private conversations have not been such that I'm anxious to continue them.
Forgive my speaking so bluntly, but it is the truth.
You mean last night? What else could I do? I had to throw in with her.
I don't know where the bird is, and neither do you. She does. How're we gonna get it if I don't play along with her?
You always have a very smooth explanation ready, huh?
What do you want me to do? Learn to stutter?
Dundy take you down to the station?
How long did they work on you?
Till a little while ago.
What'd they shake out of you?
Shake out?
Not one thing.
I adhered to the course you indicated earlier in your rooms, but I certainly wish you would have invented a more reasonable story.
I felt distinctly like an idiot repeating it.
Don't worry about the story's goofiness.
A sensible one would have had us all in the cooler.
You sure you didn't tell them anything?
I did not.
Now, you'll want sleep if you've been standing up under a police grilling all night.
See you later.
Yes, I'll have him call you the minute he comes in.
That's the third time she's called this morning.
Miss O'Shaughnessy's in there.
Anything else?
The district attorney's office called. Bryan would like to see you.
And a Mr. Gutman called. And when I told him you weren't in, he said, "Would you please tell him that
the young man gave me his message, and that I phoned and will phone again?"
Gutman, huh? Thanks, darling.
Darling. Somebody's been in my apartment.
It's all upside down, every which way. I changed as fast as I could and came right over here.
You must have let that boy follow you there.
No, angel. I shook him off long before I ever went to your place.
It might have been Cairo.
He wasn't at the hotel last night. He told me he'd been standing up under a police grilling. I wonder.
You saw Joel this morning?
Yeah.
Why?
Because, my own true love, I've got to keep in some sort of touch with all the loose ends of this dizzy affair if I'm ever gonna make heads or tails of it.
Now we've got to find a new home for you.
I won't go back there.
I got an idea.
What does your woman's intuition tell you about her?
She's all right.
Maybe it's her own fault for being in whatever the trouble is, but she's all right, if that's what you mean.
That's what I mean. Are you strong enough for her to put her up for a few days?
You mean at home?
Yeah. - Is she in any danger, Sam?
I think she is.
Gee, that'd scare Mom into a green hemorrhage.
I'd have to say she's a surprise witness or something you're keeping undercover until the last minute.
You're a darling.
Brigid. Effie here has offered to put you up for a few days.
That's very kind of you.
You'd better start now. Go out the back entrance. There's usually a cab parked there by the alleyway.
You ride partway with her over the bridge and make sure you're not followed. You better change cabs a couple of times, just to be on the safe side.
I'll give Mom a ring.
There's time enough for that when you get back.
I'll call you later.
Hello?
This is Samuel Spade.
Say, my secretary tells me Mr. Bryan wants to see me. Yeah.
Ask him what time's most convenient for him.
Spade. S-P-A-D-E.
Hello, honey.
Yeah. 2:30. All right.
Thanks.
Sam, forgive me. Please forgive me.
I sent those policemen to your place last night.
I was mad, crazy with jealousy. I phoned that if they went there, they'd learn something about Miles' murder.
What made you think of that?
I was mad, Sam. I wanted to hurt you.
Did you tell them who you were when you phoned? - No.
Sam, dearest, I...
Where'd you phone from?
The drugstore across from your place.
You better hurry along home and think of something to tell the police.
You'll be hearing from them, and by the way, where were you the night Miles was murdered?
Home.
I was.
No.
But if that's your story, it's all right with me.
Now you run along.
Hello?
Yeah, this is Spade.
Yes, Mr. Gutman, I got it.
Yeah, I've been waiting to hear from you.
Well, now. The sooner, the better. Say, 15 minutes?
Right. 12C.
12C to your left, sir.
Mr. Spade.
How do you do, Mr. Gutman?
You begin well, sir. I distrust a man who says "when."
He's got to be careful not to drink too much, because he's not to be trusted when he does.
Well, sir, here's to plain speaking and clear understanding.
You're a close-mouthed man?
No, I like to talk.
Better and better. I distrust a close-mouthed man.
He generally picks the wrong time to talk and says the wrong things.
Talking's something you can't do judiciously unless you keep in practice.
Now, sir.
We'll talk, if you like. I'll tell you right out. I'm a man who likes talking to a man who likes to talk.
Swell. Will we talk about the black bird?
You're a man for me, sir. No beating about the bush. Right to the point.
Let's talk about the black bird, by all means. But first, sir, answer me a question.
Are you here as Miss O'Shaughnessy's representative?
Well, there's nothing certain either way. It depends.
It depends on?
Maybe it depends on Joel Cairo.
Maybe.
The question is then which you represent. It'll be one or the other.
I didn't say so.
Who else is there?
There's me.
That's wonderful, sir, wonderful.
I do like a man who tells you right out he's looking out for himself.
Don't we all? I don't trust a man who says he's not.
Now, let's talk about the black bird.
Let's.
Mr. Spade, have you any conception of how much money can be got for that black bird?
No.
Well, sir, if I told you, if I told you half, you'd call me a liar.
No, not even if I thought so.
But you tell me what it is, and I'll figure out the profit.
You mean, you don't know what the bird is?
I know what it's supposed to look like, and I know the value in human life you people put on it.
She didn't tell you what it is?
Cairo didn't, either?
He offered me $10,000 for it.
$10,000.
Dollars, mind you, not even pounds.
Do they know what that bird is, sir? What is your impression?
There's not very much to go by. Cairo didn't say he did, and he didn't say he didn't.
She said she didn't, but I took it for granted she was lying.
Not an injudicious thing to do.
If they don't know, I'm the only one in the whole wide sweet world who does.
Swell. When you've told me, that'll make two of us.
Mathematically correct, sir, but I don't know for certain that I'm going to tell you.
Don't be foolish. You know what it is. I know where it is.
Well, sir, where is it? You see, I must tell you what I know, but you won't tell me what you know.
It's hardly equitable, sir.
No, no. I don't think we can do business along those lines.
Well, think again, and think fast!
I told that gunsel of yours you'd have to talk to me before you're through!
I'm telling you now, you'll talk to me today, or you are through!
What are you wasting my time for? I can get along without you!
And another thing, keep that gunsel out of my way while you're making up your mind.
I'll kill him if you don't! I'll kill him!
Well, sir, I must say you have a most violent temper.
Think it over. You've got till 5:00.
Then you're either in or out, for keeps!
Who killed Thursby? - I don't know.
Perhaps you don't, but you could make an excellent guess.
My guess might be excellent or it might be crummy, but Mrs. Spade didn't raise any children dippy enough to make guesses in front of a district attorney, an assistant district attorney and a stenographer.
Why shouldn't you, if you've nothing to conceal?
Everybody has something to conceal.
I'm a sworn officer of the law, 24 hours a day, and neither formality nor informality justifies you withholding evidence of crime from me except, of course, on constitutional grounds.
Now, both you and the police have as much as accused me of being mixed up in the other night's murders.
Well, I've had trouble with both of you before, and as far as I can see, my best chance of clearing myself of the trouble you're trying to make for me is by bringing in the murderers all tied up.
And the only chance I've got of catching them and tying them up and bringing them in is by staying as far away as possible from you and the police, because you'd only gum up the works.
You getting this all right, son, or am I going too fast for you?
No, sir. I'm getting it all right. - Good work.
Now, if you want to go to the board and tell them I'm obstructing justice and ask them to revoke my license, hop to it.
You tried it before, and it didn't get you anything but a good laugh all around.
Now, look here. - And I don't want any more informal talks.
I've nothing to say to you or the police, and I'm tired of being called things by every crackpot on the city payroll.
So, if you want to see me pinch me or subpoena me or something, and I'll come down with my lawyer.
I'll see you at the inquest, maybe.
Come on. He wants to see you.
I didn't expect you till 5:25. I hope I haven't kept you waiting.
Keep on riding me, they're gonna be picking iron out of your liver.
The cheaper the crook, the gaudier the patter, huh?
Now, let's go.
Come on. This'll put you in solid with your boss.
Come in, sir. Thank you for coming. Come in.
Here. You shouldn't let him go around with these on him. He might get himself hurt.
Well, well, what's this?
A crippled newsie took them away from him. I made him give them back.
By gad, sir, you're a chap worth knowing. An amazing character. Give me your hat.
Sit down.
I owe you an apology, sir.
Now, never mind that.
Let's talk about the black bird.
All right, sir, let's.
Let's.
This is going to be the most astounding thing you've ever heard of, sir.
And I say this knowing that a man of your caliber and your profession must have known some astounding things in his time.
What do you know, sir, about the Order of the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem, later known as the Knights of Rhodes and other things?
Crusaders or something, weren't they?
Very good. Sit down.
In 1539, these crusading Knights persuaded Emperor Charles V to give them the island of Malta.
He made but one condition, that they pay him each year the tribute of a falcon in acknowledgement that Malta was still under Spain.
Do you follow me?
Have you any conception of the extreme, the immeasurable wealth of the Order of that time?
I imagine they were pretty well fixed.
Pretty well" is putting it mildly. They were rolling in wealth, sir.
For years they'd taken from the East nobody knows what spoils of gems, precious metals, silks, ivory, sir.
We all know the holy wars to them were largely a matter of loot.
The Knights were profoundly grateful to the Emperor Charles for his generosity toward them.
They hit upon the happy thought of sending him, for his first year's tribute, not an insignificant live bird but a glorious golden falcon crusted from head to foot with the finest jewels in their coffers.
Well, sir, - what do you think of that?
I don't know.
These are facts, historical facts, not schoolbook history, not Mr. Wells' history, but history, nevertheless.
They sent this foot-high jeweled bird to Charles, who was then in Spain. They sent it in a galley commanded by a member of the Order.
It never reached Spain.
A famous admiral of buccaneers took the Knights' galley and the bird.
In 1713, it turned up in Sicily.
In 1840, it appeared in Paris.
It had, by that time, acquired a coat of black enamel, so that it looked nothing more than a fairly interesting black statuette.
In that disguise, sir, it was, as you may say, kicked around Paris for over three score years by private owners too stupid to see what it was under the skin.
Then, in 1923, a Greek dealer named Charilaos Konstantinides found it in an obscure shop.
No thickness of enamel could conceal value from his eyes.
You begin to believe me a little?
I haven't said I didn't.
Well, sir, to hold it safe while pursuing his researches into its history, Charilaos re-enameled the bird.
Despite this precaution, however, I got wind of his find.
If I'd only known a few days sooner.
I was in London when I heard. I packed a bag, got on the boat train immediately.
On the train I opened the paper, The Times, and read that Charilaos's establishment had been burglarized and him murdered.
Sure enough, on arriving there, I discovered the bird was gone.
That was 17 years ago.
Well, sir, it took me 17 years to locate that bird, but I did.
I wanted it. I'm a man not easily discouraged when I want something.
I traced it to the home of a Russian general, one Kemidov, in an Istanbul suburb. He didn't know a thing about it.
It was nothing but a black-enameled figure to him, but his natural contrariness kept him from selling it to me when I made him an offer.
So I sent him some agents to get it.
Well, sir, they got it and I haven't got it.
But I'm going to get it.
Your glass.
Then the bird doesn't really belong to any of you, but to a General Kemidov?
Well, sir, you might as well say it belonged to the King of Spain.
I don't see how you can honestly grant anyone else a clear title to it except by right of possession.
And now, sir, before we start to talk prices, how soon can you or how soon are you willing to produce the Falcon?
A couple of days. - That is satisfactory.
Well, sir, here's to a fair bargain.
Profits large enough for both of us.
What's your idea of a fair bargain?
I will give you $25,000 when you deliver the Falcon to me and another $25,000 later on.
Or I will give you one quarter of what I realize on the Falcon.
That would amount to a vastly greater sum.
How much greater? - Who knows?
Shall we say $100,000?
Would you believe me if I name a sum that seems the probable minimum?
Why not?
What would you say to a quarter of a million?
Then you think the dingus is worth a million, huh?
In your own words, why not?
That's a lot of dough.
A lot of dough.
Minimum, huh? What's the maximum?
The maximum, I refuse to guess.
You'd think me crazy.
I don't know. There's no telling how high it could go, sir. That is the one and only truth about it.
Wilmer!
Hello, Effie. It's me. Let me talk to Miss O'Shaughnessy.
Isn't there?
What?
She didn't show up?
Listen, you get on back to the office and wait there till I come or you hear from me.
Yeah, let's do something right for a change.
It started in the hold aft, in the rear basement.
What insurance was she carrying?
Anybody burnt? - No. Only the harbor watch was aboard!
Someone I know came...
Huh?
Someone I know came aboard this afternoon, and I haven't seen her since. I'm worried.
No reason to be, mister. Everybody got off all right.
I wonder if you saw her. She's kind of small, about 5-foot...
I couldn't tell you, mister.
But if she come aboard, she got off all right. Only the harbor watch was aboard when the fire started.
Now you know as much about it as I do, precious.
Maybe they went down to the ship. Maybe they didn't.
The part about the bird is thrilling.
Or ridiculous.
You know. Falcon.
Lock that door.
Is... - Is he...
Yeah.
He couldn't have come far with those holes in him.
Why couldn't he have stayed alive long enough to tell us something?
Here, here, here, none of that now.
Come on. - You can't pass out on me now.
All right, Sam.
Do you really think it's...
We've got it, angel, we've got it!
You're hurting me.
Answer the phone.
Hello.
Yes.
Who? Oh, yes.
Where?
Yes, yes.
Hello? Hello! Hello!
That was Miss O'Shaughnessy. She wants you. She's in danger.
Where is she?
Burlingame, 26 Ancho.
Sam, her voice, it was awful. And something happened to her before she could finish.
Go help her, Sam!
You've got to go to her, don't you see? He was helping her, and they killed him...
You've got to go, Sam!
All right, I'll go.
Now, after I've gone, you phone the police. Tell them how it happened, but don't drag any names in.
You don't know. I got the phone call and told you I had to go, but I didn't say where.
Now forget about this thing. Tell them how it happened, but without the bundle. Now get that straight.
Everything happened exactly as it did happen, but without the bundle, and I got the phone call, not you.
Yes, Sam.
Okay.
Shut this door and lock it behind me and don't open it till the police come.
Do you know who he is?
Yeah, it's Captain Jacoby, master of the La Paloma.
You're a good man, sister.
Can I borrow your pencil?
Sure.
Say, Frank?
Hello, Mr. Spade.
You got plenty of gas?
Sure thing.
Do you know where Ancho Street or Avenue is in Burlingame?
Nope, but if she's there, we can find her.
Well, 26 is the number and the sooner the better.
All right.
Keep your motor running.
Bum steer, Mr. Spade?
Yeah.
Let's get to a phone booth.
Hello, Mrs. Perine? Is Effie there?
Yes, please. Hello, precious.
What's the good news?
No, no. It was a bum steer. Are you sure that was her voice?
Well, it was hooey.
Everything go all right?
Nothing said about the bundle, huh?
That's swell.
They take you down to the hall?
All right, precious. You better hit the hay and get a good night's rest. You sound all in.
No, no. Save it till tomorrow. I'm going on home.
Thanks. Good night, Frank.
Good night, Mr. Spade.
I've been hiding in a doorway up the street. I thought you'd never come.
Can you make it all right, or shall I carry you?
I'll be all right as soon as I can get some place where I can lie down.
Well, sir, we're all here.
Now, let's come in and sit down and be comfortable and talk.
Sure. - Get away.
You're not gonna frisk me.
Stand still. Shut up.
Take your paws off me, or I'll make you use that gun.
Ask your boss if he wants me shot up before we talk.
Never mind, Wilmer.
You certainly are a most headstrong individual.
Well, let's be seated.
Are you ready to make the first payment and take the Falcon off my hands?
Well, sir, as to that...
As to that...
$10,000?
We were talking about a lot more money than this.
Yes, sir, we were. But this is genuine coin of the realm.
With a dollar of this, you can buy $10 of talk. And there are more of us to be taken care of now.
That may be, but I've got the Falcon.
I shouldn't think it would be necessary to remind you, Mr. Spade, that you may have the Falcon, but we certainly have you.
Yeah, I'm trying not to let that worry me.
We'll get back to the money later on. There's something else to be discussed first.
We've got to have a fall guy.
The police have got to have a victim, somebody they can pin those three murders on.
Three? But there's only two, because Thursby certainly killed your partner.
All right. Only two then. What difference does it make?
Come, come, Mr. Spade, you can't expect us to believe at this late date that you're the least bit afraid of the police,
or that you're not quite able to handle... - I'm in this up to my neck, Gutman.
I've got to find somebody, a victim, when the time comes.
Let's give them the gunsel.
He actually did shoot Thursby and Jacoby, didn't he?
Anyway, he's made to order for the part. Look at him.
Let's give him to them.
By gad, sir, you are a character. That you are.
There's never any telling what you'll say or do next, except that it's bound to be something astonishing.
Why, it's our best bet. With him in their hands...
But, my dear man, can't you see that if I, even for a moment, thought of doing such a thing...
That's ridiculous. I feel towards Wilmer here just exactly as if he were my own son. Really, I do.
But if I even for a moment thought of doing what you propose, what in the world would keep Wilmer from telling the police every last detail about the Falcon and all...
Let him talk his head off. I'll guarantee you nobody'll do anything about it.
Well, what do you think of this, Wilmer?
Mighty funny.
Mighty funny.
How do you feel now? Any better, precious?
Much better. But I'm frightened.
Well, don't be. Nothing very bad's going to happen here.
You want a drink, angel?
Be careful, Sam.
Well?
If you're really serious about this, the least we can do in common politeness is to hear you out.
Now, how would you be able to fix it so that Wilmer couldn't do us any harm?
I can show Bryan, our district attorney, that if he goes around trying to collect everybody, he's gonna have a tangled case, but if he sticks to Wilmer here, he can get a conviction standing on his head.
Get up on your feet. I've taken all the riding from you I'm gonna take.
Get up and shoot it out!
Young Wild West.
Maybe you'd better tell him that shooting me before you get your hands on the Falcon is gonna be bad for business.
Now, now, Wilmer.
We can't have any of that. You shouldn't let yourself attach so much importance to these things.
Then tell him to lay off me then.
Now, Wilmer...
Your plan is not at all satisfactory, sir. Let's not say anything more about it.
All right. I've got another suggestion. It may not be as good as the first one, but it's better than nothing.
You want to hear it?
Most assuredly.
Give them Cairo.
Well, by gad, sir...
And suppose we give them you or Miss O'Shaughnessy? How about that?
You want the Falcon. I've got it.
The fall guy's part of the price I'm asking.
As for Miss O'Shaughnessy, if you think she can be rigged for the part, I'm perfectly willing to discuss it with you.
You seem to forget that you are not in a position at all to insist upon anything.
Now, come, gentlemen. Let's keep our discussion on a friendly basis.
There certainly is something in what Mr. Cairo said.
If you kill me, how are you gonna get the bird?
And if I know you can't afford to kill me, how are you going to scare me into giving it to you?
Sir, there are other means of persuasion besides killing and threatening to kill.
Yes, that's...
That's true.
But they're none of them any good unless the threat of death is behind them. You see what I mean?
If you start something, I'll make it a matter of your having to kill me or call it off.
That's an attitude, sir, that calls for the most delicate judgment on both sides.
Because, as you know, sir, in the heat of action, men are likely to forget where their best interests lie and let their emotions carry them away.
Then the trick from my angle is to make my play strong enough to tie you up, but not make you mad enough to bump me off against your better judgment.
By gad, sir, you are a character.
Six-two uneven. They're selling you out, sonny.
I hope you're not letting yourself be influenced by the guns these pocket-edition desperadoes are waving around.
Because I've practiced taking guns away from these boys before, so we'll have no trouble there.
Wilmer, here is...
All right.
Wilmer. Wilmer! Wilmer!
There's our fall guy.
Either you'll say yes right now, or I'll turn the Falcon and the whole lot of you in.
Don't like that, sir. You won't like it.
Well?
You can have him.
I won't be able to get the Falcon till daylight, or maybe later.
It strikes me it'd be best for all concerned if we did not get out of each other's sight until our business has been transacted.
You have the envelope?
Miss O'Shaughnessy has it. That's all right. Hang on to it.
We don't have to lose sight of each other. The dingus'll be brought to us here.
Excellent, sir, excellent.
And in exchange for the $10,000 and Wilmer, you'll give us the Falcon and an hour or two of grace.
Now, let's get the details fixed, first.
Why did he shoot Thursby and why, where and how did he shoot Captain Jacoby?
You see, I've got to know all that happened, so I can be sure the parts that don't fit are covered up.
I shall be candid with you, sir. Thursby was Miss O'Shaughnessy's ally.
We believed that disposing of him in the manner we did would cause Miss O'Shaughnessy to stop and think that, perhaps, it would be best to patch up her differences with us regarding the Falcon.
Then you didn't try to make a deal with him before giving him the works?
We did. Yes, sir. We most certainly did.
I talked to him myself that very night, but I could do nothing with him.
He was quite determinedly loyal to Miss O'Shaughnessy.
So Wilmer followed him back to the hotel and did what he did.
That sounds all right.
Now, Jacoby.
Captain Jacoby's death was entirely Miss O'Shaughnessy's fault.
Tell me what happened.
Well, Cairo, as you must have surmised, got in touch with me after he left police headquarters yesterday night or morning.
He recognized the mutual advantage of pooling forces.
Mr. Cairo is a man of nice judgment.
The Paloma was his thought.
He saw the notice of its arrival in the papers and remembered he had heard in Hong Kong that Jacoby and Miss O'Shaughnessy were seen together.
Well, sir, he saw that notice and, putting two and two together, guessed the truth.
And at that juncture, you decided to slip me a Mickey, huh?
There was no place for you in our plan, sir.
So we decided to spare ourselves any possible embarrassment.
Mr. Cairo and Wilmer and I went to call on Captain Jacoby.
We were lucky enough to arrive while Miss O'Shaughnessy was there.
In many ways, the conference was difficult, but we finally persuaded
Miss O'Shaughnessy to come to terms, or so we thought.
We then left the boat and set out for my hotel, where I was to pay Miss O'Shaughnessy and receive the bird.
Well, sir, we mere men should have known better.
En route, she, Captain Jacoby and the Falcon slipped completely through our fingers.
It was neatly done, sir. Indeed, it was.
You touched off the boat before you left?
No, not intentionally. Though, I daresay, we, or Wilmer at least, were responsible for the fire.
While the rest of us were talking in the cabin, Wilmer went about the boat, trying to find the Falcon.
No doubt, he was careless with matches.
How about the shooting?
We caught up with Miss O'Shaughnessy and Jacoby at her apartment.
I sent Wilmer downstairs to cover the fire escape before ringing the bell.
And, sure enough, while she was asking us who we were through the door, and we were telling her, we heard a window go up.
Wilmer shot Jacoby as he was coming down the fire escape, shot him more than once, but Jacoby was too tough to fall or drop the Falcon.
He climbed down the rest of the way, knocked Wilmer over and ran off.
We persuaded, that is the word, sir, we persuaded Miss O'Shaughnessy to tell us where she had told Captain Jacoby to take the Falcon.
And we further persuaded her to phone your office in an attempt to draw you away before Jacoby got there, but, unfortunately for us, it had taken us too long to persuade Miss O'Shaughnessy.
And you had the Falcon before we could reach you.
Well, Wilmer, I'm sorry indeed to lose you, but I want you to know I couldn't be fonder of you if you were my own son.
But, well, if you lose a son, it's possible to get another.
There's only one Maltese Falcon.
When you're young, you simply don't understand these things.
How about some coffee?
Put the pot on, will you, angel? I don't like to leave our guests.
Surely.
Just a moment, my dear. Hadn't you better leave the envelope in here?
Sit on it, if you're afraid of losing it. You misunderstand me.
It's not that at all.
But business should be transacted in a businesslike manner.
For instance, there are only nine bills here now. There were 10 when I handed them to you, as you very well know.
Well? I want to know about this.
You palmed it.
I palmed it?
Yes.
Do you want to say so, or do you want to stand for a frisk?
You're going to admit it, or I'm gonna search you.
There's no third way. By gad, I believe you would. I really do.
You palmed it.
Yes, sir, that I did.
I must have my little joke now and then. And I was curious to know what you would do in a situation of this sort.
I must say you passed the test with flying colors.
It's the sort of a thing I'd expect from somebody Wilmer's age.
This will soon be yours. You might as well take it.
I ought to have more than $10,000.
Of course, sir. You understand this is the first payment.
Later. Oh, yes. Later you'll give me millions, but how's about $15,000 now?
Frankly and candidly, upon my word of honor as a gentleman, $10,000 is all the money I can raise.
But you didn't say positively. Positively.
I'd like to give you a word of advice. Go ahead.
I daresay you're going to give her some money, but if you don't give her as much as she thinks she ought to have, my word of advice is be careful.
Dangerous? Very.
How's the coffee coming, angel?
In a few minutes.
It's almost daylight, Mr. Spade. Can you start getting it now?
I guess so.
Hello?
Hello, precious. I'm sorry to get you up so early. Now, listen carefully.
In the holland box at the post office there's an envelope with my scrawl.
In that envelope, there's a parcel-room check for the bundle we got yesterday.
Now, get that bundle and bring it here, PDQ.
That's a good girl. Now hustle. Goodbye.
Thanks, lady. Sorry to spoil your day of rest.
Not the first one you've spoiled. Anything else?
No. No, thanks.
Bye-bye, then.
There you are.
Now, after 17 years...
It is it. But we'll make sure.
Fake. It's a phony! It's lead!
It's lead! It's a fake!
All right, you've had your little joke. Now, tell us about it.
No, Sam! No!
That's the one I got from Kemidov. I swear it!
You. It's you who bungled it. You and your stupid attempt to buy it!
Kemidov found out how valuable it was!
No wonder we had such an easy time stealing it! You imbecile! You bloated idiot!
You stupid fathead, you!
Yes, it's the Russian's hand. There's no doubt about it.
Well, sir, what do you suggest?
We stand here and shed tears and call each other names, or shall we go to Istanbul?
Are you going?
Seventeen years I've wanted that little item and have been trying to get it.
If we must spend another year on the quest, well, sir, it will be an additional expenditure in time of only five and fifteen-seventeenths percent.
I'm going with you.
Wilmer.
A swell lot of thieves.
We've little enough to boast about, sir, but the world hasn't come to an end just because we've run into a little setback.
I must ask you for that envelope.
I held up my end. You got your dingus.
It's your hard luck, not mine, it wasn't what you wanted.
Now, come, sir, we've all failed, and there's no reason for expecting any of us to bear the whole brunt.
In short, sir, I must ask you for my $10,000.
This'll take care of my time and expenses.
Now, sir, we'll say goodbye to you, unless you care to undertake the Istanbul expedition with us.
You don't? Well, frankly, sir, I'd like to have you along. You're a man of nice judgment and many resources.
Now that there's no alternative, I daresay you'll manage the police without a fall guy.
I'll make out all right.
Well, sir, the shortest farewells are best.
And to you, Miss O'Shaughnessy, I leave the rara avis on the table there as a little memento.
Hello. Is Sergeant Polhaus there?
Yeah. Put him on. This is Sam Spade.
Hello. Tom? Now, listen.
Jacoby and Thursby were killed by a kid named Wilmer Cook.
Yeah. He's about 20 years old, 5'6", wearing a gray overcoat.
He's working for a man named Kasper Gutman.
Now, you can't miss Gutman. He must weigh 300 pounds.
That fellow Cairo's in with him, too.
They just left here for the Alexandria Hotel. But you'll have to move fast. They're blowing town.
Now, watch yourself when you go up against the kid. Yes, that's right. Very.
Now, good luck, Tom.
They'll talk, when they're nailed, about us. We're sitting on dynamite.
We've only got minutes to get set for the police. Now, give me all of it, fast.
When you first came to my office, why did you want Thursby shadowed?
I told you, Sam. I thought he was betraying me, and I wanted to find out.
That's a lie!
You had Thursby hooked, and you knew it, and you wanted to get rid of him before Jacoby came with the loot, so you wouldn't have to split it with him. Isn't that so? What was your scheme?
I thought if he knew someone was following him, he'd be frightened into going away.
Miles wasn't clumsy enough to be spotted the first night.
You told Thursby he was being followed.
I told him. I told him. Yes, but please believe me, Sam.
I wouldn't have told him if I thought Floyd would kill him.
If you thought he wouldn't kill Miles, you were right, angel.
Miles hadn't many brains, but he'd had too many years experience as a detective to be caught like that by a man he was shadowing up a blind alley with his gun on his hip and his overcoat buttoned.
But he'd have gone up there with you, angel.
He was just dumb enough for that.
He'd have looked you up and down, and licked his lips and gone, grinning from ear to ear.
And you could have stood as close to him as you liked in the dark and put a hole through him with a gun you got from Thursby that evening.
Don't, Sam. Don't say that!
Stop it! The police'll be here any minute! Now talk!
Why do you accuse me...
This isn't the time for that schoolgirl act! We're both of us sitting under the gallows!
Now, why did you shoot Miles?
I didn't mean to at first, really, I didn't.
But when I found out that Floyd couldn't be frightened... I can't look at you and tell you this, Sam!
You thought Thursby would tackle Miles and one or the other would go down.
If Thursby was killed, you were rid of him.
If it was Miles, you'd see that Thursby was caught and set up for it.
Isn't that right?
Something like that.
When you found that Thursby wasn't going to tackle him, you borrowed his gun and did it yourself, right?
And when you heard Thursby was shot, you knew Gutman was in town.
And you knew you needed another protector, somebody to fill Thursby's boots, so you came back to me.
Yes! Sweetheart, it wasn't only that.
I'd have come back to you, sooner or later. From the very first instant I saw you, I knew.
Well, if you get a good break, you'll be out of Tehachapi in 20 years, and you can come back to me then.
I hope they don't hang you, precious, by that sweet neck. - You're not...
Yes, angel, I'm gonna send you over.
The chances are you'll get off with life. That means, if you're a good girl, you'll be out in 20 years.
I'll be waiting for you.
If they hang you, I'll always remember you.
Don't, Sam. Don't say that, even in fun.
I was frightened for a minute. I really thought... You do such wild and unpredictable things.
Now, don't be silly. You're taking the fall.
You've been playing with me, just pretending you cared to trap me like this.
You didn't care at all!
You don't love me!
I won't play the sap for you.
You know it's not like that. You can't say that.
You never played square with me for half an hour at a stretch since I've known you.
You know down deep in your heart that in spite of anything I've done, I love you.
I don't care who loves who! I won't play the sap for you! I won't walk in Thursby's and I don't know how many others' footsteps!
You killed Miles, and you're going over for it.
How can you do this to me, Sam?
Surely Mr. Archer wasn't as much to you as...
Listen. This won't do any good.
You'll never understand me, but I'll try once and then give it up.
When a man's partner is killed, he's supposed to do something about it.
It doesn't make any difference what you thought of him. He was your partner, and you're supposed to do something about it, and it happens we're in the detective business.
Well, when one of your organization gets killed, it's...
It's bad business to let the killer get away with it, bad all around, bad for every detective everywhere.
You don't expect me to think that these things you're saying are sufficient reason for sending me...
Wait till I'm through. Then you can talk.
I've no earthly reason to think I can trust you, and if I do this and get away with it, you'll have something on me that you can use whenever you want to.
Since I've got something on you, I couldn't be sure that you wouldn't put a hole in me someday.
All those are on one side. Maybe some of them are unimportant. I won't argue about that.
But look at the number of them. And what have we got on the other side?
All we've got is that maybe you love me and maybe I love you.
You know whether you love me or not. Maybe I do.
I'll have some rotten nights after I've sent you over, but that'll pass.
And if all I've said doesn't mean anything to you, then forget it and we'll make it just this,
I won't because all of me wants to regardless of consequences, and because you've counted on that with me the same as you counted on that with all the others.
Would you've done this to me if the Falcon had been real and you'd got your money?
Don't be too sure I'm as crooked as I'm supposed to be.
That sort of reputation might be good business, bringing high-priced jobs and making it easier to deal with the enemy, but a lot more money would have been one more item on your side of the scales.
If you'd loved me, you wouldn't have needed any more on that side.
Come in.
Hello, Tom. Got them?
Got them.
Swell. Here's another one for you. She killed Miles.
And I've got some exhibits, the boys' guns, one of Cairo's, and a $1,000 bill I was supposed to be bribed with, and this black statuette here that all the fuss was about.
What's the matter with your little playmate? He looks brokenhearted.
And I bet when he heard Gutman's story, he thought he had me.
Cut it out, Sam.
Well, shall we be getting down to the hall?
It's heavy. What is it?
The stuff that dreams are made of.
STORMY WATERS
Get on. You're drunk.
I'm not drunk.
I'm ill because of the food.
Besides, it's their fault. I'd told Poubennec:
We should've done your wedding aboard the Cyclone."
Then I'd have done the cooking.
You're not fit to talk to me!
You're not a man.
How do you mean?
You cook for the Dutch.
You're no longer a man or a cook.
A potato is what you are.
A spud.
That's right, you're a spud.
Shut up, cook.
Let the doctor speak.
Okay, I'll let him speak.
A sailor's marriage isn't like any other marriage.
As the poet said, every sailor has two wives:
His own and the sea.
Still you mustn't be jealous, ladies.
The sea isn't a mean mistress, even when she's rough.
And if your husband's with her, he's faithful to you.
The things Maulette comes up with...
Now, I propose a toast to the health of the newlyweds.
And here's to the crew of the Cyclone, the bravest crew in Brest.
Valiant rescuers, whose certificates and medals prove...
Please, Doctor. I heard that at the Sorbonne.
Whatever you say, Captain.
Here's a toast to Captain Laurent and his charming wife.
Hurray for the Captain, for one finds captains both in Brest and all over the world.
And good captains they are. Excellent captains even.
But a captain like yours, gentlemen, has no equals.
The mold he was cast in got broken.
Captain, your speech.
Nothing to say. Forgive me.
Say something, they'll like it.
The doctor spoke like a book.
I've nothing to tell, I'm no storyteller.
Poubennec's married. He's happy, so is his wife.
So we're all happy. What else is there to say?
I propose a toast to those who are on duty on the Cyclone.
And in the memory of those who were here once and have left us.
No more speeches. This is a wedding. We're here to be merry!
Let's dance.
May I dance with the bride?
Of course, your Cyclone is a good tug. I don't deny that.
But the Dutch is good as well.
She's new and she's fast. And I mean "fast".
So what? We get there first.
You must admit she's quite a competitor.
They play a trick on us, we pay them back double.
Goes with this blasted business.
Don't complain. Saving lives is a beautiful job.
Talk about a beautiful job...
Lives don't pay, but you also have the boat...
A boat, when you've hooked it, you're in for a lot of money.
It's harder than simply hooking it.
Must moor it to the quay.
Plus, we handle the charcoal, the damage... all the hassle.
All that means risks.
And then the good weather, it spells unemployment for us.
A storm a day, that'd be too good.
Poubennec, give me my wife back.
Yours has nice eyes and is a good dancer.
That's easy with a partner like you.
You are a good dancer, we haven't danced together for so long.
I was there watching you, thinking it still feels the way it did ten years ago.
I felt so good.
I love you so much, Andre.
Why are you so sad all of a sudden?
I'm not at all sad.
But I love you and I know you love me.
You men don't understand these things.
What things?
For instance, that we can feel so entirely happy, and still feel like crying.
It's a fine time for crying...
We have fun at a wedding!
Go on, tell me what's wrong.
Don't be mad because I'm nervous.
Sometimes I get so worried.
Worried? What do you worry about?
Nothing.
What do you mean?
Well, your job, the boat, the sea...
The sea?
That's new!
It isn't.
I've always felt this way.
And you know it.
I stop living when you're at sea.
At sea! You're making me laugh.
There was a time when I'd be away for months, but nowadays I practically go nowhere.
Our house is here, the boat's round the corner.
Only short cruises alongside the quay.
We only go out when we're needed.
Which means danger.
Look in the corners, you'll find lovers.
They look like newlyweds themselves.
Hey, take a look at Tanguy's wife with Le Gall.
Quite an edifying show!
What's he doing? Talking and talking.
Honestly, I wouldn't want Tanguy to butt me.
Because if he did, he'd gore me alright with his horns.
There's a pump by the kitchen.
Go rinse your head and get back when you're sober.
Go on, do it.
What's the matter?
It's nothing.
Fancy a dance?
No more tears?
No.
It was a passing cloud.
Captain Laurent, please.
Go on, Mr. Holland!
Nothing like this to put your wits back together.
Leave it, I'm tired.
Here I am, Mr. Tanguy.
I'll handle the expenses.
Stop being silly, it's an SOS.
We'll cast off.
What are you doing? You're crazy! That's my truck!
Never doubted that.
I know, Mrs Laurent. That's his job...
Still, on a day like today...
Don't complain, Marie. We're married.
If it'd been yesterday, there'd have been no wedding.
Hurry up, old man.
Don't fret, I won't leave her alone tonight.
If you see my wife, tell her I said good-bye.
I love her.
Let's go.
Everyone's here? Where's Le Gall?
Yes, where's he gone?
We can't wait, old man.
What boat is it?
Mirvakin, 6,000 tons, broken rudder.
44-46 north. 6'50" west.
That's all?
Good. Send a signal.
From Cyclone, ocean tug.
1,800 H.P. Coming out for you.
Ready to go about?
Keep the bike till tomorrow.
60 revs ahead.
Where were you?
My business. - Also concerns me.
People look for me, they can find me.
You won't say where you were?
Everyone knows, but Tanguy.
He's my second.
His wife can do whatever she likes, but not with members of my crew, understand?
I was away 15 minutes.
You know what those 15 minutes mean?
We risk everything for 5 minutes.
Next time, you go.
Get along now!
Port ten. You're going off course!
Mirvakin accepts on Loyd terms.
Confirm it. I'll take the risk.
Gouedic, just one thing, hot drinks for everyone all night.
I left it open!
What a mess! Andre's certificate! His latest one!
He's saved many people.
But the bad weather takes its revenge.
You know, I used to look at that photo and think I'd also marry some day.
You both still look the same.
When you're in love, 10 years go by so fast!
You were also happy that day.
But a week later, Andre went to Chile for 6 months.
Our honeymoon trip.
Your dress looks like mine, despite fashion.
A white dress is a white dress.
What's most like a bride?
Another bride.
Are you ill?
No, it's nothing.
Heart flutter. I've always had it, since I was a child.
Have you seen the doctor?
Doctor Maulette likes me.
Someone who likes you can't imagine you're ill.
Tonight I told Andre I was worried. He laughed. He can laugh, he's strong.
And he has things: His boat, the sea...
I only have him.
I wish we could go away.
It's sad here!
We're surrounded by memories, portraits, letters, certificates...
Couples shouldn't keep things.
We should live, love, be together...
When something nice happens, we say:
I'll never forget this moment," as we know it won't last.
Besides, I'm fed up.
I'm ill, I'm afraid...
Yes, I'm talking nonsense, Marie.
I'm afraid of dying alone.
One day, when Andre's away at sea, he won't be here to kiss me and tell me that he's always loved me.
Feed that fire!
I'm telling you.
When the eyes start popping out in the broth, you're going too fast.
The eyes?
But your casserole has no eyes.
It's blind.
Still on cloud nine with the bride.
You must admit it was quite a wedding, everything was going well.
Then something went wrong, it had to be at my wedding.
I'll only admit this:
I'm not married. I wasn't trying to discourage you.
Faithful women must exist.
After all, one can even find two-headed sheep and three-legged snakes.
Captain, I'm tired of this cuckold talk.
I feel like drowning them in the broth.
They're only having a laugh.
I don't care, I'm tired of these jokes.
That grumpiness means Tanguy's afraid of losing his mast.
Royer, you always come up with the stupidest jokes.
And they never change!
With all my respect, I don't disturb your reading.
Why do you listen to me?
I may listen, read or eat, the contents are always demoralizing.
Good job it's such foul weather, but for it, best thing to do would be to jump overboard.
Very intelligent. Let's see...
All that reading, you'll end up doing something silly.
I prefer you plastered, a lesser evil.
Where are you off to?
Get all hands. I'll be in the wheelhouse.
What are they saying?
Say something.
Answer me, dammit!
Keeps saying the same thing:
Near you. Prepare towrope."
The towrope?
Look at them!
They're like old sacks.
Like insects. They're worse than beasts.
What? Won't you listen?
They'll miss the tow!
For God's sake, Charles, wake them up!
What am I supposed to do.
They won't budge!
Bunch of dirty bastards!
Let him fix the cable himself.
And go in the water with it.
He got us here. He must save us!
You shouldn't talk so!
Why not? We'll die anyway!
I'd hate to die like this.
We can lower a raft.
Are you mad? Let them be, Georges.
Let them drown, if it's what they want.
What does he say?
Some customers! Listen to this:
Hurry up. Deck destroyed. Need urgent help."
How he talks! Some sink without saying a word.
Remember that three-master?
They can't all sink like heroes.
That's not all. Three other ships request assistance.
Typical!
It never rains, but pours. Can't help it.
Rockets! Must be them.
To top it off, she's adrift!
Send them a signal.
Say: "Heading for you.
Passing rope.
Get ready to catch it."
Nice prize to hook. Isn't it, Captain?
Worth the hassle. A fine ship.
The Cyclone is on us.
They'll try to send us the towrope.
Take this to the captain.
No, don't.
I'll do it myself. That'll be better.
The Cyclone is here. We must send them the towrope.
Calm down. No need to hurry.
6 hours, we've been waiting.
They bid their time.
We'll do the same. That'll teach them.
If we don't maneuver at once, we will suffer the consequences.
No need to hurry.
And to hell with their towrope.
Why didn't they hurry up? 6 hours, after all the messages we sent!
Now they're here, we must bow to them.
We've waited this long, we'll wait longer. - Is that clear?
I see, but... The way we're drifting, we'll float away and crash on the rocks.
I want to save my skin.
All you care about is your skin!
Forget the cargo, let it buy your lives.
The cargo's mine, get it?
I paid for it!
Anybody wants to share the costs? You? The man in a hurry?
It's my first and last voyage with you.
Blast your scams.
The towrope's here to hitch us up.
Stay there.
I'll handle the maneuver.
Marc!
You're not happy?
Think about your men!
I do!
A man's only 50 francs a day.
The insurance covers men and goods.
The boat sinks, I'll get the money, the widows will get a pension.
That's not enough.
You're too coward to be a real sailor!
What do you care what I am?
That never bothered you.
You're a bastard.
You've always been one.
For two years, I've had to put up with your face, your talk...
But I never thought you could be as low on your boat.
Your men should drown you.
Catherine, I won't leave you.
I hate you.
One knows well the person one hates.
I heard your lies just now! You will sacrifice your men for your money!
The truth is, you're really trying to get to me!
2 years of the same.
I was with you, you were glad to see me suffer.
Now you know as soon as we land, I'll be gone.
Never mind the boat and the men, you hate to lose me.
Enough, Catherine!
I may die, but not by your side. I'll take my chances.
Will they take the towrope or what?
Weird! All that whining, now what?
What a wimp! Dear God!
A raft...
Good lord! Look at that raft!
They must be nuts! A raft in this weather!
The searchlight! We must make for them.
Go port, 15.
Look, Captain. They'll go under.
If they don't, they'll crash into us anyway.
A raft in the sea with the 2nd helmsmen and 2 sailors.
I wish them luck.
Your wife's with them.
What?
She jumped on the descending raft.
No stopping her!
The bitch!
They're being fished up.
The Cyclone!
Happily, I managed to keep contact.
All right.
That bitch will pay me!
What's wrong, Tanguy?
A woman.
Half dead, half drowned... All I know is it's a woman.
And Poubennec: 2 crushed fingers. - Shit!
I'll see him later, the sun's on us, we must act fast.
Send the towrope. - Yes, Captain.
And the woman?
What?
Put her in my cabin, she'll be warm.
To windward. Hard aport.
Take the towrope.
Stand by!
We've hitched up!
Ahead, as slowly as possible.
I'll see how the boys are at the galley.
Hello, lads. How is it going?
Let's see you.
A Breton's head, that's solid stuff.
Still, got a chip in my piggy bank.
You'll get that fixed in Brest.
You'll get a new nickel-plate zipper.
Girls never resist that!
You, Poubennec?
Not too bad, Captain.
A bit worried, though. Two fingers!
Two fingers! That can't affect a newlywed.
Could've been worse!
That idiot!
Understands nothing and won't stop laughing.
This isn't a galley!
It's a children's hospital, The Tower of Babel...
They've tied it too badly.
Shit!
50 grand down the drain.
Haul in the bits. We'll send a new one.
Good end for the season!
That'll cost them about 8 grand.
Maybe. It's a good deal.
See, George, everything works out.
We simply get dragged now. No need to hurry in life.
Poor Catherine, panicking over nothing.
She wanted to go and leave me.
Where is she now, I wonder?
At the other end of the line.
Matrimonial ties are hard to break.
This little adventure will come out expensive.
It's good for their company: Shipwreckers United.
Say, Georges?
Captain?
The towrope tore this morning, very naturally.
Suppose it tore again once it's pulled in, would that surprise anyone?
Not too injured?
Grazed my arm.
You cleaned the wound?
We dressed it.
Has she said anything?
A little.
Is she French?
From Le Havre.
How did she end up here?
Listen, Bosco.
Hellegouarch and Poubennec need an ambulance.
How are they?
Poubennec's lost blood.
Nice honeymoon.
Tough luck!
Are there any injured?
Others like you on your ship?
I'm the only woman.
You often go rafting in this weather?
Couldn't care less.
I just take back all I catch.
Don't...
Rescuing is a wonderful job!
You call this rescuing?
I'm only catastrophe's pen-pusher.
Handle the papers. I'll see Poubennec's wife.
I wanted to ask you...
Have you towed Mirva?
The Cyclone goes out, she never comes back alone.
She's behind us. - Too bad!
What? You're a funny one!
You wouldn't understand.
Maybe.
But do you realize what this cruise means to us?
It took my men 12 hours to hitch up your boat and fish up people like you.
If this were our daily routine, we'd change jobs.
I thought I'd escaped that boat, but she's here.
Listen, sweet pie, I don't want to know your stories.
Everybody's got troubles.
We should leave them on land.
Like women! They should stay on land.
That's what we call a frank man.
Yes, that's a man.
Good to get home. Right, Tanguy?
Especially when you're not empty-handed.
Starboard, fifteen...
Truth is, I'll be happy to see my lovely wife. I like her.
She's lovely indeed.
Tanguy, the towrope!
It'll break!
A brand new rope, in this weather... Unbelievable!
It is unbelievable.
Read this, Captain. What a dirty trick!
Can still steer ship. Will get in unaided.
Appreciate your trouble."
Unaided"!
The rats!
They cut the towrope to get in alone and not pay.
Gang of crooks!
How is she?
Fine.
Tell him she'll go back on the raft.
What?
I'm sending you back.
I won't go.
You will and so will your pals!
Send them, if you want to.
I'm not a crew member.
I'm in charge here, understand?
Kerlo, keep the blankets.
Maritime life is swell!
You come in a raft, you go back in a raft.
I've never been so delighted to approach a ship in my life!
I was really afraid I'd become a widower.
Now I understand the meaning of understanding.
You and I are united for life.
All life long, you and I...
Captain.
What?
Someone for you.
Capt. Laurent, the Cyclone.
I am very happy.
I wanted to see you.
You did!
That was so kind of you.
Are you kidding?
Not at all.
I owe you a lot!
So you've found a way not to pay!
Come on, I don't understand...
Can you explain why and how the towrope broke?
Hard, isn't it?
Good weather, quiet sea...
And to top it off, a brand new rope!
Quite a mystery! A miracle!
Here's my version:
You backed up and broke it.
And you got in unaided. There you go.
You must be joking!
How can you imagine I'd do that to a sailor?
Please, spare me your bullshit!
Crooks are crooks even on a boat.
I understand your frustration.
But you shouldn't accuse me of that!
You have no evidence at all!
It's fine to defend the interests of your company.
But it makes plenty of money, Capt. Laurent!
Losing some won't bust it.
Oh, yeah...
I'm sure we can come to an agreement.
I'm not an ungrateful chap.
I like to reward good will.
You've worked all night and saved my wife.
That counts!
So you and I could maybe agree on something to reward your efforts.
How much?
Andre...
I haven't shaved.
I'm very prickly.
Doesn't matter. I'm so happy you're back.
Look at you! I wasn't in Greenland!
I swear I wasn't that far.
They made us move.
You wouldn't believe it.
Poubennec told me about your troubles.
Poor fellow lost 2 fingers. How did his wife react?
First, Marie cried.
Then she was almost happy.
Happy?
She thinks he'll give up sailing now.
What would he do instead?
Knitting?
You women, you all want us sitting by the fire like pensioners.
Don't get angry.
Always the same old story.
You're hungry.
I have cutlets.
Cutlets!
I could eat an entire lamb!
I'm so tired!
It gives me the creeps, I swear, when I think about Hellegouarch's busted head.
And the charcoal, the towropes...
The whole thing's a disaster!
Stop thinking about it.
Let's eat.
Yes, I'll eat the cutlets.
I'm hungry as a wolf.
I'm so hungry, I'm yawning.
At least this is real coffee, it's not Royer's water.
You're a kind little wife.
You make me feel good.
I wish you'd love me. - Are you raving?
Love me as before...
I understand, you've grown too used to me.
I'm always there, so are you. The days go by...
Why aren't we as happy as we were in the first days?
Only women can come up with such questions!
I'm very happy with you.
Are you unhappy?
Almost.
Why?
If it goes on like this, I will be.
What's the matter?
My sad little life, that's the matter!
We could be so happy if you wanted to be.
Please, be reasonable. I've enough worries as it is.
Oh forgive me...
Come on. Don't be silly.
Help me. I must write a report and send it to Paris.
What infuriates me is that the Company will be pleased.
I had a good reputation.
Now I've bungled a job, they'll make the most of it.
Sometimes I swear I feel like packing it all in and resigning.
We have enough to live on.
Do you really mean it?
I do. Why?
Not immediately, of course.
But later, and I mean it.
Later is always too late.
We could have a peaceful life.
If you felt bored, you could go back to sea.
But we'd have had a long holiday.
We'd go to Paris a while.
And you wanted a house here.
A fixed boat.
It'd be nice to have a house of our own, with a big bedroom, all white, overlooking the sea, as you like the sea.
That may be Marie.
Hello, Mr. Tanguy.
Mrs. Laurent.
Is it a bad time? - No, come in.
Tanguy, just in time for coffee.
Actually, I'm a bit nervy today.
So no coffee...
What's the matter?
Captain, I'd rather not discuss it in the presence of your wife.
Besides, I have itchy feet, so maybe we could go for a walk.
I understand, let's go.
Excuse me.
Don't worry.
I swear it's a serious situation.
Don't make such a drama out of it. These things happen.
They only happen to me. - No.
I won't make a drama but frankly, you're happy to get home...
That was me. Then silence. No one.
Except for the cat and the children.
A nightmare! She went out yesterday morning, slept out...
And nothing. Not even a message.
I don't understand.
And to be honest with you, I'm not really angry, I'm worried.
What do you mean?
Worried.
Come on, do you think your wife could be lost?
You seem to like playing the fool.
The fool?
Exactly, pal. She's been openly cheating on you.
You're the laughingstock for everyone.
I know that.
So why don't you ditch her?
Ditch her. Ah, I've wanted to for a long time, but never dared.
But this is it.
Given enough rope, you'll hang yourself.
Some people won't be happy. Mr. Lemeur for one. What?
What is it?
I'm about to make you unhappy, Mr. Lemeur.
The source of your good jokes will dry up.
And I say this in front of everyone:
The fool's dead.
Think of me as a widower or a bachelor from now on.
Hello.
Gabriel, I'm so happy. I knew you'd be here.
I've been worried stiff, darling.
Renee, I've told you:
Given rope enough...
I'll hang myself. I know it.
Don't I get a kiss?
You're shy because they're here.
What do you care?
I was so worried in Conquet last night.
What did you go there for?
I was with Etiennette.
She was going to catch a boat to Ouessant, to meet Gaudin, the radioman.
He's been moved there.
Didn't you know it?
I didn't. So what?
The boat didn't leave because of the bad weather.
Such awful weather! You know what I'm talking about.
So everyone stayed there.
Pierrot, Lou and Mrs. Frapier.
You stayed with them all day?
Yes.
And all night?
Yes.
Why?
What do you mean?
I was looking after Etiennette.
Was she sick?
Seasick.
But the boat never left.
Anxiety. She's so nervous.
She didn't sleep a wink, neither did I.
A howling wind.
I said to Etiennette: "Gabriel must be in the eye of the storm."
Despite the appearances, I think about you when you're at sea.
Why aren't you listening?
It's nothing.
Let's go away.
Where to?
What? Home, of course!
Oh yes, home...
You feel like laughing, but you dare not.
You should, there's reason to.
Right, Le Gall?
Capt. Laurent's here?
That's me, lad.
It's all right.
I'll be at the Hotel de la Mer.
I'm sorry to bother you, you must be busy.
I thought you were gone.
No, I was a bit ill.
Come sit down.
I hesitated to call you, but I'm alone here.
And I wanted to see you and thank you.
You shouldn't bother.
I wanted you to know...
I'll be honest with you.
I didn't save you, my second did.
So that's not why you sent for me, I suppose.
Don't beat around the bush, tell me what you want.
Are you always so rude to women?
In my line, we're not used to dealing with women.
Wish I hadn't rescued your husband's ship.
Please, don't mention my husband.
You're his wife.
Not anymore. I've left him.
I last saw him the day you sent me back to him.
You won't see him anymore?
If I have my way.
Maybe it's better like this.
Anyway, the Company lost 3 grand.
Some men live on that. They'll pay for the towrope.
Any idea who cut it?
I know who did it, but can't prove it.
Easy, the entire Mirva crew know it.
I'm not the only one who knows him.
Where on earth did you find that man?
He bought goods there every 2 months, and took them to his region.
He offered to take me with him. I said "yes."
How long ago?
Two years.
That's long when you hate someone.
What's the matter?
You're different from the woman I saw in my cabin, soaking wet.
Shipwreck costumes don't suit me.
You're better now.
You do notice women.
Excuse me, I must go.
Not a drink?
No time. - The boss is waiting for me.
He can wait.
He's like a clock.
Just wind it back.
I really must go.
Do you regret coming?
I have no regrets.
Good-bye.
Where were you, Captain, when the second towrope broke?
Where was I?
In the food cupboard, cooling up.
Please, Captain.
I mean, what did you see exactly?
What you would have seen.
A towrope breaking.
And you can still assert that someone did that.
I'm sure someone did.
You are! It's proof we need.
Investigate, you'll find proof.
We could investigate, we could file a lawsuit.
We could also lose it.
Our clients wouldn't like it, nor would the directors.
Those directors want to blame me?
Fine me?
Give me a dunce hat?
We know your worth.
So do I. Tell them they're annoying me.
And I'm being polite.
Actually, I have a present for them. I quit.
You quit?
You can't! Are you mad? Mad enough to do this job.
I've been considering quitting.
I'd like to relax and take walks like everyone else.
With my wife.
And I guarantee she'll be happy.
Nothing we can do.
Without you, we'll sell the Cyclone.
What?
That's right, and we've had some very good bids.
Who from?
The Franco-Dutch company.
Great idea...
What about the crew?
I'm afraid we may be forced to lay them off.
Nice...
Business and feelings...
Business and feelings don't go hand in hand.
Yvonne, how can a sensible woman like you imagine such things?
Whatever you say, what I have is serious.
I've known it some time.
Like all patients, you don't know what you have and you imagine the worst.
What you really need now is rest, peace and quiet.
No excitement. - I'll talk to Andre about it.
Please, don't.
I trust you. Don't tell him.
I'll do it myself.
Okay, I won't tell him.
Good-bye.
Don't worry.
I'll come see you.
Maybe not here. Andre saw a seaside house.
I'd love to have a house by the sea.
Doctor Ripault?
This is Maulette.
I need to see you about a patient of mine.
I should say a friend.
Yes, I suspect it's serious.
Very serious.
Good, all right.
Thank you. Good-bye.
Don't you mind taking a walk with a silent man?
No.
When two people are quiet, they have a lot to say.
They try to guess each other's thoughts.
It's very nice.
Are you doing that now?
I'm not thinking about anything.
I feel too good.
I'm very happy you've taken me out.
That's all.
You're not difficult.
Just a walk on the beach, and you're happy, like a child.
I wish I were still "like a child."
When I was little, things were so simple.
If I was happy, I'd laugh. If I was sad, I'd cry.
But now...
Now what?
Now, it's not the same.
I'm happy and unhappy.
It's all become very blurry.
Look.
A starfish.
Must have fallen last night.
What's your name?
What's yours?
Mine? It's Andre.
My name's Catherine.
That's my given name.
Everyone called me that.
Father, mother, the whole family.
Catherine, elbows off the table.
Catherine, say hello.
Catherine..." It tingled my ears.
It was funny. I kept thinking:
That's not your name, they call you that."
So I found myself a name.
A new one.
For yourself? Yes.
I used to think:
You'll say your name to the boy who loves you."
Did you find that boy?
No, I've met some men.
One who died and my husband.
So?
They did like everybody else. They called me Catherine.
I'll get the keys to visit it.
Where's the house?
Up there, by itself.
Fancy visiting houses!
Come with me?
Yes.
It's dark here.
I'll open the shutters.
It's so secluded.
Yes.
Nice spacious room.
Reminds me of a film I saw long ago.
A horror film, with ghosts.
Everybody laughed, but I was very scared.
Big armchairs like these ones.
They remind me of the film.
The girl sat in an armchair, screamed
and disappeared.
Nobody saw her? - Who?
The girl.
I don't know.
Maybe I'd disappear as well.
Now, no silly thoughts.
Women like me were made to disappear.
Why?
That's the way it is.
We come in a raft, we go in a raft.
Been married long?
I hate that sort of question.
That's a good answer.
You're getting better.
What are you looking at?
The door. There are only bad doors here.
The wind whistles in. Imagine!
You think about everything.
Have to.
Of course...
Where are you going?
I'm curious, you know.
Catherine...
Why did you call me?
I scared you?
No, it felt funny.
You sounded like my husband.
He called me, I ran to him. It wasn't love.
And he lied.
Still, I'd come and he'd caress me.
You miss that.
What a brute you are!
After all...
Maybe all men are brutes.
You're angry?
No.
Nice, a white bedroom overlooking the sea.
Shut up!
Why?
Because.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
Can't you tell me what's on your mind?
It's easy though.
I say everything I think.
Everything!
I'm not asking anything.
Plus, I'm fed up. I really am.
What am I doing here with you? It's mad! Look at me.
No.
Bet it amuses you, a babbling man. I realize I'm babbling.
Listen, you're wasting your time.
I'm not into games.
I'm a simple man.
Simple men don't hide their thoughts.
They're not ashamed of their desires.
You're just like the other men.
You have lots of scruples and you never stop thinking.
Your present thoughts will never be known.
Even if you wanted to speak, you couldn't.
You'd babble away, to hide everything.
Why are you saying this?
What do you want from me?
Say it!
You say everything you think, right?
So what do you want from me?
And you? What do you want?
You.
Stop talking.
Kiss me.
Kiss me.
Where's Captain?
Why?
Not an SOS, but a sailboat in trouble. We need him.
Mr. Kerlo, what's wrong?
An SOS. Is Captain here?
No.
Where's he?
Driving by the sea.
Around Creuzon.
Thank you.
Been looking for you.
What's the matter?
A sailboat in distress.
Sent an SOS long ago?
The time it took me to find you.
I'll go.
Stop the winch! It's no use.
What are you doing?
It's pointless to go now, Captain.
The Dutch has already hitched up.
How long ago?
Long enough.
Is it you, Andre?
Is it you, Andre?
It's me.
Kerlo didn't find you?
Yes, he did.
Wasn't it anything serious?
A sailboat in distress. The Dutch rescued it.
The Dutch?
Yes.
So, if you let them...
You've quit? You've done it?
No...
The administrator... Have you spoken to him?
Yes, I have.
You didn't even ask for a holiday?
Can't leave the ship and the crew.
It's stronger than me.
Yes, stronger than you.
Actually stronger than me!
I can't endure this life anymore.
I'll get ill.
Who gets ill like that?
You promised me.
I just can't.
You don't understand?
What if I were really ill?
If I said "I need fresh air, I'm suffocating, open the window"?
Would you stand there, stiff-lipped, and say "Impossible, must keep the window shut"?
What do you mean?
It can't be.
You were smiling.
You're mad!
Daydreaming. I was watching you.
You had a sparkle in your eyes.
What's going on?
Don't be silly.
Don't leave me alone.
You're here, but I'm alone.
You try to be caring, but you can't. You're so cold.
I have worries.
Lucky you. Keeps you busy.
I have no worries. I'm bored.
I'm bored to death.
Andre, do you still love me?
You're complicated!
It's easy. Just say "yes" or "no."
You think I don't love you, as I love my job.
What's all that to me?
Your job, your ship, everything?
The world might as well be flooded over, for all I care.
Our life is in shambles.
Don't say that.
Shut up. - I won't.
I've been quiet for years. This is my SOS.
You're right. Stroke my hair.
I'm your wife, your property.
You like owning things, don't you?
Your crew, your ship, your wife...
These things are in your hands.
Any blemish, you open your hands.
You like what's strong like you, what's new.
The Albatross, your ship... when she was scrapped, you nearly broke down.
But when you saw the brand-new Cyclone, you were in bliss.
All over her, caressing her.
Shut up! - No, I won't.
I've been unhappy too long.
And I'm ill!
If you were, you wouldn't be talking like that.
Why didn't you say you were unhappy earlier?
I was happy before, Andre.
And I want that back.
But I know you, you only think of yourself.
I've only been waiting.
It suited you. I can't take it anymore, I'm ill.
Stop it! I've had enough of that illness bullshit.
You're such a brute!
I hate you. Go away.
Say it once more...
Once, 10 times, 20 times...
Go away!
Andre, where are you going?
To my ship.
That's not normal.
He spends hours watching the floor or the ceiling.
Lights a cigar, doesn't smoke.
I ask him if he's hungry.
Lemeur's right, he's weird.
He's not weird. He's bored!
Why?
Any of our business?
No, but we can't leave him like that.
Why are you laughing?
There's no answer to boredom. You hear me? None whatsoever.
I've tried everything.
What is it?
Come on, Captain...
I'm not hungry, pal. I want to be left alone!
You're worried, so I worry too.
Leave me alone, for God's sake!
Say, Tanguy.
You came to see me about your wife.
You were wrong. And so was I, to give you advice.
What goes on between two people, no one else can understand.
You were waiting for me?
Yes, I was.
What took you so long?
Lots of troubles.
You don't see it coming, then it hits you.
So I stayed in my cabin like a fool.
I've thought about you.
I've been thinking about you all the time.
Have you?
I like the storm.
I could feel it coming, I felt stifled.
Now I can breathe. I feel much better.
Hold me in your arms.
It's out. That's fine.
They say lightning can strip you naked without harming you.
You can do that as well.
I need you, Catherine.
Don't call me Catherine.
Tell me the name you wanted for yourself alone.
Yes...
Aimee!
You find it silly.
I was little, I wanted to be loved.
That's the best I could find: Aimee.
What is it?
It's a power cut. Apparently, it may last a while.
There. Better than nothing, right?
I've changed so much since I met you.
I'm a new man.
All I used to like and live for is now meaningless.
Hard as I try, I can't be reasonable.
In this weather, I'd be at sea with my crew.
But I'm here, looking at you.
And I'm happy.
I'm very happy.
All I care about now is not losing you.
The storm brought me, remember?
Now he's coming to get me. I know what he's crying out:
It's over. You've been happy too long.
Now it's time to go."
Why are you saying this?
Because I can't live here without you.
You have a life I can't be part of.
I love you.
Because I'm here today.
I've spent two days thinking about you.
What can I say about my wife?
That was different. It was...
It's over now.
She's told me so herself.
You believed her?
You pretended to because it suited you.
No, for me it's much simpler.
I've never been into having affairs.
If it was an affair, I wouldn't be here.
I'm here because I love you.
You see, we'll be together.
I don't want to let you go anymore.
What is it?
I don't know.
I beg your pardon?
Someone wants to speak to you.
To me?
What's wrong?
Mrs. Laurent.
I've come to tell you she's very ill.
She's ill?
She doesn't know I'm here. The doctor's with her.
It's bad. She wants you.
Doctor? Is she in danger?
Here, Andre. Hurry up.
What?
Hurry up.
I'm sorry to bother you, but I don't know why...
I thought he'd be here.
Yes, he was here.
I'll have to pack in the dark.
Luckily I didn't unpack much.
Are you leaving?
There's a train at nine tonight.
Will you still sail a lot with Capt. Laurent?
I will.
What else am I supposed to do?
Plus, I like it with him.
I'll ask you a favor.
I'd be very happy to do something for you.
Will you be seeing him every day?
Yes.
So you'll see if he's sad... if he's sad or unhappy.
Unhappy people easily recognize one another.
It'd be sad if we didn't.
Give this to him. It's a starfish.
I got it from him. He'll understand.
But if you see he's happy, throw it in the sea.
The starfish...
Marie, you must be tired.
I'm not, really.
What's wrong?
What's wrong with her?
She's been ill for a while, but wouldn't tell you.
She got worse all of a sudden.
Is she in danger?
She's weak.
We gave her two injections.
My darling...
You can't imagine how happy I am.
With you here, I'm better.
Forgive me. I didn't realize how ill you were. You were right.
But now I'll give it all up and we'll go south.
It's warm and sunny down there, you'll get well quickly.
Forgive me for having left you.
It's normal to want to be alone.
And I'd been so silly.
Luckily, what we say when we're suffering doesn't count.
I wanted to tell you...
Get your head next to mine.
And don't say anything.
I'm ill, I have the right to speak.
And I have so much to tell you, which I hid for fear you'd laugh.
I love you so much, you can't imagine.
You know, I was jealous. That made me suffer.
Stop talking.
When I saw other people and the way they love and live, I thought:
Andre is different.
He's never cheated on you."
I felt so happy, you can't imagine.
Yvonne, you know...
Don't be sad.
I'm not sad now that you're here.
I'm looking at you.
I can see you.
Tell me?
Kiss me.
Tell me you love me, Andre.
Say you've always loved me.
What's happening?
We've just got a strange SOS.
Yvonne!
It can't be!
Yvonne!
It can't be! This isn't happening!
I can't believe this!
It can't be!
Captain, an SOS.
What do I care? An SOS...
It's the Dutch.
In distress, going onto the rocks.
They're calling us. We can't let them down.
What do you want me to do? The Dutch...
Faithful Servant. I render you to Him who formed you from clay.
Faithful Servant.
May the army of Martyrs lead you into triumph.
May the splendor of Saints be upon you.
May the Virgins greet you.
May the assembly of Patriarchs lift you into hope.
Faithful Soul.
Faithful Servant.
Soul of Your Servant.
Perils, grief and tribulation. As Elijah perished and as all men shall.
Deliver her, Lord. Deliver Your Servant.
As Noah from the deluge. Deliver her, Lord.
Deliver, Lord...
The soul of Your Servant.
As Isaac from his father's hand.
As you delivered Moses from the pharaoh, king of Egypt.
As you delivered Daniel from the lions' den.
So that you may escape the Darkness and the moanings of flames
and the pain of torment.
Faithful Servant. - Faithful Soul.
May the comforting Angels meet you and lead you by the hand.
Michael. - Gabriel. - Raphael.
So that you may enjoy the sweet rest.
So that you may be set in the Garden of Delights.
So that your eyes may see the unveiled truth, in solitude.
Stand by to go out.
Ahead. 60 revs!
You see the symbolism of it?
Capital and labour destroy each other.
It teaches a lesson, a moral lesson. It has social significance.
Who wants to see that kind of stuff? It gives me the creeps.
Tell him how long it played in the music hall.
It was held over a fifth week.
Who goes to the music hall?
Communists!
Communists?
This picture's an answer to communists.
It shows we're awake and not dunking our heads in the sand.
I want this picture to be a commentary on modern conditions, stark realism, the problems that confront the average man.
But with a little sex. - A little, but I don't want to stress it.
I want this picture to be a document, I want to hold a mirror up to life.
I want this to be a picture of dignity, a true canvas of the suffering of humanity.
But with a little sex. - With a little sex in it.
How about a nice musical?
How can you talk about musicals at a time like this, with the world committing suicide, with corpses piling up in the street, with grim death goggling at you from every corner,
with people slaughtered like sheep!
Maybe they'd like to forget that.
Then why did they hold this one over for a fifth week at the music hall?
It died in Pittsburgh.
Like a dog.
What do they know in Pittsburgh?
They know what they like.
If they knew what they liked, they wouldn't live in Pittsburgh.
If you pander to the public, you'd still be in the horse age.
Look at Hopalong Cassidy!
You look at him!
We'd still be making Keystone chases, bathing beauties, custard pies...
And a fortune.
A fortune!
Of course I'm just a minor employee here, Mr LeBrand.
He's starting that one again.
I wanted to make you something outstanding, something you could be proud of, something that would realise the potentialities of film as the sociological and artistic medium that it is, with a little sex in it.
Something like...
Something like Capra. I know.
What's the matter with Capra?
Look...
You wanna make O Brother, Where Art Thou?
Then go ahead and make it.
I can't afford to argue.
That's a fine way to start a man on a million-dollar production.
You want it, you've got it.
I can take it on the chin. I've taken it before.
Not from me, you haven't.
Not from you, Sully, that's true.
Not with pictures like Hey-Hey In The Hay Loft,
Ants In Your Plants of 1939, but they weren't about tramps, lockouts, sweatshops, people eating garbage in alleys and living in piano boxes and ash cans...
And phooey.
They were about clean young people in love, with laughter, music and legs.
But you don't realise conditions have changed.
There isn't any work, there isn't any food, these are troublous times.
What do you know about trouble?
What do I know about trouble?
What do you mean?
Just what I'm saying. You want to make a picture about garbage cans.
What do you know about garbage cans? When'd you eat your last meal out of one?
What's that got to do with it?
He's asking you.
You want an epic about misery.
You want to show hungry people sleeping in doorways.
With newspapers around them!
You want 10,000 feet of hard luck.
And all I'm asking you is, "What do you know about hard luck?"
What do you mean? - Don't you think I've?
No. You have not.
I sold newspapers till I was 20.
Then I worked in a shoe store and put myself through law school at night.
Where were you at 20? - I was in college.
When I was 13, I supported three sisters, two brothers and a widowed mother.
Where were you at 13?
I was in boarding school. I'm sorry.
Well, you don't have to be ashamed of it, Sully.
That's why your pictures are so light, so cheerful, so inspiring.
They don't stink with messages.
That's why I paid you 500 a week at 24.
750 at 25.
1,000 at 26.
When I was 26, I was getting 18.
2,000 at 27.
I was getting 25 then.
3,000 after Thanks For Yesterday.
4,000 after Ants In Your Plants.
So I don't know what trouble is?
Yes.
You're absolutely right.
I haven't any idea what it is.
People always like what they don't know anything about.
Certainly had a lot of nerve wanting to make a picture about human suffering.
You're a gentleman to admit it, Sully. But then you are anyway.
How about making Ants In Your Plants of 1941?
You can have Bob Hope, Mary Martin...
Maybe Bing Crosby.
The Abbott Dancers.
Jack Benny and Rochester.
A big-name band. - What?
Oh, no.
I wanna make O Brother, Where Art Thou?
And I'll tell you what I'm gonna do first.
I'm going down to wardrobe and get some old clothes, some old shoes, and I'm gonna start out with ten cents in my pocket.
I don't know where I'm going, but I'm not coming back till I know what trouble is.
Don't worry, you can take me off salary.
Who's talking about taking you off salary?
So long. And thanks for the idea.
Wait! Don't be so impulsive!
When will you be back?
Maybe a week, a month, a year.
Don't worry about me. Thanks, Dracula, you gave me a great idea.
I gave you?
Now look what you've done.
What I've done?
With your lies about selling newspapers.
I sold as many newspapers as you supported a family at 13.
I opened a shooting gallery.
With money you got from your uncle.
We'd better insure him for a million.
He's worth more.
The bonehead!
Yes, but what a genius.
Get me a copy of O Brother, Where Art Thou?
I guess I'll have to read it now.
Make that two copies. Why should I suffer alone?
How's this?
Isn't that overdoing it a bit, sir?
Why break their hearts?
All right, let's try that one again.
I think this one's sufficiently seedy, sir.
There's no use overplaying it, is there, sir?
Yes?
Your wife is on one, sir.
What does she want?
I suspect it's to do with today's being the 15th.
Payday. All right, put her on.
You may connect, Mrs Sullivan.
Yes?
You don't happen to remember what day this is, do you, dear?
Yes, I happen to remember what day it is.
No, I haven't forgotten anything. Have you?
Well, perhaps I could be more polite, Mrs Sullivan, but somehow when I talk to you I don't feel polite.
I regret it but that's the way it is.
I don't know whether I signed it or not.
I always close my eyes when I sign your cheque.
Maybe I signed the blotter.
You made out the panther woman's cheque yet?
You'd better get it down to her before she comes up here with the sheriff.
She has a very peculiar sense of humour.
Good morning, sir. - Morning, Burrows.
How do you like it?
I don't like it at all, sir. Fancy dress, I take it?
What's the matter with it?
I have never been sympathetic to the caricaturing of the poor and needy.
Who's caricaturing?
He doesn't know about the expedition.
I'm going on the road to find out what it's like to be poor and then I'm gonna make a picture about it.
If you permit me to say so, sir, the subject is not an interesting one.
The poor know all about poverty, and only the morbid rich would find the topic glamorous.
But I'm doing it for the poor.
I doubt if they would appreciate it, sir.
They rather resent the invasion of their privacy, I believe.
Also, such excursions can be extremely dangerous, sir.
I worked for a gentleman once who likewise with two friends accoutred themselves as you have, sir, and went out for a lark.
They have not been heard from since.
That was some time ago.
1912, sir.
Uh-huh.
You see, sir, rich people and theorists - who are usually rich people - think of poverty in the negative, as the lack of riches, as disease might be called the lack of health.
But it isn't, sir.
Poverty is not the lack of anything, but a positive plague, virulent in itself, contagious as cholera, with filth, criminality, vice and despair as only a few of its symptoms.
It is to be stayed away from, even for purposes of study.
It is to be shunned.
You seem to have made quite a study of it.
Quite unwillingly, sir. Will that be all, sir?
Thanks.
Very good, sir.
He gets a little bit gruesome every once in a while.
Always reading books, sir.
Oh.
As a matter of fact, sir,
I don't like the idea of a gentleman of your inexperience leaving with only ten cents in his pockets.
So I took the extreme liberty, sir, of having a studio identification card sewn into the soles of each of your boots.
You'd think I was a child or something. The whole purpose of this expedition...
Before you all get started, I just want to tell you one thing - my mind is made up. All right, all right.
Nobody's here to argue with you, Sully.
I know.
We talked it all over, and there's something to the idea.
There's a great deal to it. - It's stupendous.
Cassy has it worked out.
It's safe as a church, big as a cathedral. Bigger!
It's the story of the year, Sully.
It'll make every front page.
I'm sending five of my boys...
With me in charge.
And agents in front and behind.
I want lots of eight by tens.
Now, listen...
Revamping that lovely land yacht that De Mille used.
It follows you at a discreet distance...
Hot coffee, sandwiches and a bar.
It's connected to the studio by short wave, and it also carries a hot shower and a secretary.
And a physician.
Look, I'm trying to find trouble, but I won't find it with six acts of vaudeville on my tail, at least not the kind I'm looking for.
Be reasonable, Sully.
I'm reupholstering it. - What do you say?
I tell you I've made up my mind.
Definitely?
Definitely!
In that case there's nothing else to do but serve you with this little summons to show cause why you should not be restrained from jeopardising your unique and extraordinary services
by wilfully, recklessly...
Will you please wait a minute!
We have all day, Sully.
But you must realise we also have minds, also made up.
Thus begins this remarkable expedition into the valley of the shadow of adversity.
The shadow of the what?
The valley of the shadow of adversity. It's what you call a paraphrase.
Alone and unattended.
With eight stooges.
I'll write the story, if it's just the same to you.
Prey to passing prowlers, poverty and policemen.
How poetic.
With only ten cents in his pocket.
I wish I had what he's got in the bank.
John Lloyd Sullivan, the caliph of comedy departed Hollywood at four o'clock this morning.
Can I serve you another stack, Doctor?
Get me some bicarbonate of soda and don't call me Doctor.
He was talking to me, I think. No, thank you.
You say you don't want no bicarbonate of soda, Doctor?
Don't call me Doctor. - No, I don't want any bicarbonate of soda.
I thought you said you did.
Well, he don't.
This pace is very depressing.
So was the breakfast.
Why doesn't he read a book if he wants to learn something?
Who, the cook?
He could learn plenty.
No, Sullivan.
Maybe he don't know how to read.
The cook?
No, the...
This is gonna be a great trip.
Sorry, I must have the wrong number.
That was the lighthouse keeper on San Clemente Island.
Ask him what his daughter's doing.
I said the lighthouse keeper on San Clemente Island.
How about a little gin rummy?
I don't drink, thank you, never touch it.
How about a lift?
If you don't mind going fast.
I'm studying to be a whippet tanker.
Go to it, Lieutenant!
Get in, General!
Can a whippet tank make a sharp turn?
What?
Can a whippet tank go up a side road?
A whippet tank can go anywhere!
Hang on.
Thank you, Major.
This is where I get out.
She's some tank, ain't she?
In a class by herself. I never felt anything like it.
Well, I guess I'd better be getting to school now anyway.
Yeah, I guess you better had. Drive carefully.
You know me.
By the way, how old are you?
13. So long.
What a future.
What were you chasing? A jackrabbit?
Felt more like a kangaroo.
There he is.
Well, how'd you like it?
That was a dirty trick, boss.
Look, that was just a rough idea unless you play ball with me.
I can't do what I started out to do with you guys chasing me around, so I'll make you a fair proposition.
You go on wherever you like and take it easy for a couple of weeks and I'll join you then or sooner.
If the boss wants to talk to me,
I'm just up ahead mooching lunch from a farmer's wife.
Now is that a square proposition or isn't it?
I always wanted to go to Boulder Dam. - You're there.
If you think I'm gonna look at a dam...
How about National Yellow Park?
That goes double for National Yellow Park.
Now, if you'd said Las Vegas...
What do they do in Las Vegas?
Everything, Doctor.
It's an education.
All right, I'll meet you in Las Vegas on or about the 1 st.
And thanks, kids. Thanks sincerely.
Yoo-hoo!
Yes, ma'am?
Don't get too tired.
Yes, ma'am.
First day's work. You don't suppose you're overworking him, do you?
I doubt it. He seems very strong.
Did you notice his torso?
I noticed that you noticed it.
Don't be vindictive, dear.
Some people are just naturally more sensitive to some things in life.
Some are blind to beauty, while others...
Even as a girl you were of the acid type, while I, if you remember...
I remember better than you do.
Forget it.
Furthermore, I have never done anything that I was ashamed of, Ursula.
Neither have I.
Yes, dear, but nobody ever asked you to.
Why, Zeffie...
Now you've had your attack for the day, let's recapture our good humour and remember our breeding.
Baloney.
Yes.
Oh, I do hope he'll like it here - it's so hard to keep a man. - Do you know what I need?
Yes.
I need a permanent.
I was thinking of taking in a picture show, which brings up the problem of clothes for the young man.
It certainly does.
Do you think dear Joseph would mind if we gave him some of the clothes he has so little need for now?
Well, he's never minded before.
Sleep tight.
Yes, ma'am.
And don't let the skeeters bite.
Yes, ma'am.
You're sure you have everything you want?
Absolutely sure? - Positive.
Oh, but your bed isn't open.
That's all right. I'll take care of that.
Oh, nonsense. That's woman's work.
♪ For men must work and women must weep ♪
Or however it goes. Ah...
There. Would you like a hot-water bottle?
No, ma'am.
Oh, you haven't any PJs.
I never use 'em.
Joseph wore a nightgown.
Is that a fact?
Well, I guess there's nothing else.
I guess not.
Oh, I'll let you know as soon as the bathroom is free.
It's, er, community. - Ah...
Well, er... good night.
Good night.
Do you think he'll stay?
I do, do hope so.
Who is it?
Hey. Could you give me a lift?
I'm freezing to death.
What'd you fall into?
Everything there was.
OK, hop in the back. There.
Drape this around you.
Thanks a m-million, b-b-buddy.
OK.
Come on, buddy, wake up.
This is as far as I go.
Huh? What?
Who are you?
Come on, wake up!
I don't want the boss to see you. I ain't supposed to give no lifts.
Thanks a lot.
Hey, what city is this?
That's Hollywood.
Hollywood?
You got a chance to see them picture stars. Well, so long.
Good morning.
Morning.
Give me a cup of coffee and a doughnut, if that's enough for it.
Plain or with powdered sugar?
With a little cream.
The sinker?
Just any kind or some rolls, I don't care.
Yes, sir.
Give him some ham and eggs.
Yes, ma'am.
That's very kind of you, sister, but I'm not hungry.
Cup of coffee and a sinker'll fix me up fine.
Don't be a sucker. Give him some ham and eggs.
Way I fix, 35 cents isn't gonna make any difference.
Here.
Thanks.
Things a little tough, huh?
Wouldn't be sitting in an owl wagon for local colour.
They locked me out of my room.
That's too bad.
Things are tough everywhere - war in Europe, strikes over here,
there's no work, there's no food.
Drink your coffee while it's hot.
Why'd they lock you out of your room?
Did I ask you any questions?
I'm sorry.
That's all right.
You been in Hollywood long?
Long enough.
Trying to crash the movies or something?
Something like that.
I guess that's pretty hard to do.
I never got close enough to find out.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Who's being sorry for who?
Am I buying you the eggs or are you buying me the eggs?
I'd just like to repay you.
All right, give me a letter of introduction to Lubitsch.
I might be able to do that, too. Who's Lubitsch?
Drink your coffee.
What'd you say?
I said, can you act? - Sure.
Would you like a recitation?
Go ahead.
Skip it.
My next act will be an impersonation of a young lady going home, from her thumb.
In that outfit?
How about your own outfit?
I mean, haven't you got a car?
No. Have you?
No, but...
Then don't get ritzy.
I'll tell you some other things I haven't got.
I haven't got a yacht, or a pearl necklace, or a fur coat, or a country seat, or even a winter seat.
I wish I could give you some of the things you need.
You wouldn't be trying to lead me astray, would you?
You know, the nice thing about buying food for a man is that you don't have to laugh at his jokes.
Just think. If you were some big shot like a casting director
I'd be staring into your bridgework saying,
Yes, Mr Smearkase. No, Mr Smearkase.
Now really, Mr Smearkase!
Oh! Mr Smearkase, that's my knee."
Give Mr Smearkase another cup of coffee. Make it two.
Want a piece of pie?
No thanks, kid.
Why, Mr Smearkase, aren't you getting a little familiar?
Look...
Thanks.
Look, if you want to stay in Hollywood a little longer...
I don't want to stay in Hollywood a little longer.
I've used up all my money.
I have a friend that's out of town and you might be able to stay at his place for a couple of weeks.
Maybe by then, things'd break a little better for you.
Or he might even be able to help you.
No, thanks.
There's no strings to this, kid. I know you don't know who I am, but...
I used to know a few people around here. This guy's really out of town.
And you know a way in through the window?
No, I'm pretty sure he...
I'm going home, big boy. I can get a ride.
I don't like to think of you asking thugs for lifts along the highway.
Then don't think about it.
You mean you'd just get in any car that comes along?
Anything but a Stanley Steamer - my uncle blew up in one.
That's terrible. You can't tell what kind of a heel's behind the wheel.
All heels are pretty much the same.
Look...
Yes, Mr Smearkase?
This friend of mine - the guy that's out of town -
I'm sure he wouldn't mind if I borrowed his car.
What is it, a streetcar?
It's a car.
You just wait here.
You're gonna get yourself in trouble.
I'm not, I'm just gonna repay you for the ham and eggs.
That isn't necessary, big boy.
Someday when your ship comes in, you can buy someone that's hungry some ham and eggs. We'll be all square.
Just wait here and I'll be back before you can say...
What was that big director's name?
Lubitsch.
Lubitsch.
Say, this is some car. - Yes.
Where would you like to go?
Oh, er... Could you drop me off at... Maybe that'd be too far.
That depends entirely on where it is.
Would Chicago be too far?
Chicago?
You mean Chicago, Illinois? - Yes.
I wasn't actually thinking of driving as far as Chicago.
That's all right. You can drop me anywhere.
I just happened to think of Chicago because that's a little better than halfway and I can easily hitch a ride out of there.
Where do you live? Bermuda?
You don't have to get funny.
I didn't ask you for a ride. Just drop me anywhere.
Now wait a minute. How's this...
Suppose you drop me off somewhere, and then you go leisurely home and I'll pick up the car later.
You don't happen to operate out of a booby hatch, do you?
You'd better drop me off and take this bus back where you stole it from.
Don't talk nonsense, I left a note saying I was taking the car.
Or did I?
Be nice if you could remember.
Would be funny if they arrested me.
Who does it belong to?
Belongs to a picture director. - A guy named Sullivan.
Oh.
Never heard of him?
No.
He's made quite a few pictures. Ants In Your Plants of 1939.
Oh, did he do that?
Yeah, did you see it?
Yes.
Well? D'you like it?
Not much. - Oh.
Some people thought it was pretty good.
I don't care for musicals, they hurt my ears.
Well, did you like Hey-Hey In The Hay Loft?
Oh, I was crazy about that.
I thought that would just about fit.
Remember the scene where the two are in the hay loft and she made him close his eyes and count to three before kissing her?
Then a pig came out and he kissed the pig instead.
It's on a very high plane.
Then he fell through a hole and sneezed at a horse.
And the horse sneezed back.
That was a wonderful scene.
It was stupid but it was wonderful. Who directed that picture?
Don't you think with the world in its present condition, with death snarling at you from every street corner, that people are a little allergic to comedies?
No.
Perhaps I didn't make myself clear.
How come you know a picture director well enough to borrow his car?
Well, as a matter of fact I used to know most those boys but naturally I don't like to mention it in a suit like this.
As a matter of fact, I used to be a picture director.
Why, you poor kid.
Don't get emotional. I'll be all right.
What kind of pictures did you make?
More along educational lines.
No wonder. Nothing like a deep-dish movie to drive you out in the open.
What are you talking about?
Film's the greatest educational medium the world has ever known.
You take a picture like Hold Back Tomorrow...
You hold it.
Did you ever meet Lubitsch?
Yes.
I bet he wouldn't speak to you now.
He spoke to me day before yesterday.
Isn't that swell?
Funny. You meet your first director on the day you leave Hollywood, all washed up.
Even a washed-up picture director.
Don't get sympathetic. I might make a comeback, you know.
That's what they all say. The man that had the room before me was always gonna make a comeback.
He was a picture director too. Then one day he shot himself instead.
They had to repaper the room.
You would never do anything like that, would you, big boy?
Not on your wallpaper.
What do you suppose that is?
Well, whatever it is, there's absolutely nothing they can do.
Remember that.
What did you say?
I said there's nothing they can do.
All right, you.
All right, yourself.
Don't give it a thought.
Well?
Oh, good morning, sir.
I'm so sorry.
Good morning, sir.
Ever seen this man?
That is Mr Sullivan, sir.
The owner of the alleged hot car.
Then what's all the hullabaloo?
That's what I'd like to know.
Are you John L. Sullivan?
What about it?
What's your occupation?
Motion picture director.
Is that right?
Yes, sir.
Let me see your driver's licence. - I haven't got it.
D'you bring it?
No, sir.
Driving without a licence?
Yes, isn't that terrible?
I suppose that calls for a dollar fine and ten minutes in jail.
You sure this is Sullivan?
Oh, quite, sir.
What are you doing in those clothes?
I've just paid my income tax.
All right. But you don't drive that car without a licence. OK.
Let the girl out too, she's getting bored in there.
How does the girl fit in this picture?
There's always a girl in the picture.
Haven't you ever been to the movies?
Where's he taking us now?
Whose car is this?
Same guy. Sullivan.
Where's he taking us?
To the depot to buy you a ticket home.
Stop fooling around.
Who's buying me a ticket?
Sullivan.
What'd I ever do for him?
You bought him some eggs.
Oh. So you're the washed-up director.
I'm afraid I exaggerated that part a little bit.
What are you doing in those clothes?
I just pulled that one at the station.
I made up a joke. Look, I'm not sore at you, I'm sore at those cops from dragging me all the way back here.
No matter where I start out for, I always end up right back in Hollywood.
You're a very nice girl and I'm glad to have met you.
If there's ever anything I can do for you, I'd be delighted. Honestly.
You mean that?
Sincerely.
Then buy me some ham and eggs before I bite you.
Home.
Where's the swimming pool?
You must have a swimming pool.
Right out here.
Outside dining room. Barbecue. Hmm.
Pretty, isn't it?
Yeah.
There's the tennis court up there, grape arbour there, and a grove there.
Well, I guess that's about all.
What are you looking at me that way for?
Hey, you big fathead.
What's the big idea?
That's for your swimming pools, tennis courts, limousines and barbecues.
That's for making fun of a poor girl who only tried to help you.
Who made fun of you?
You did with your stories of being a washed-up director.
Oh, I did, did I?
Breakfast is served, sir.
You might have shaved.
I need these whiskers for my experiment.
Oh yes, the noble experiment.
You don't have to make any cracks.
I don't suffer and starve because I like it, you know.
Neither does anybody else.
I'm sorry.
It's all right.
I'm sorry I pushed you in the water too.
I probably needed it.
You certainly did.
Did I?
I didn't mind you.
As a matter of fact, I had kind of a yen for you.
You had?
Not in that thing. I liked you better as a tramp.
I can't help what kind of people you like.
It's funny. I suppose I ought to be very happy for you, as if you'd just struck oil or something.
Instead of that, I'm sore.
Well, don't frown, you'll make lines in your face.
You've taken all the joy out of life.
I was all through with this stuff,
I mean, I knew I'd never have it, but there was no envy in my heart.
I'd found a friend who'd swiped a car to take me home.
Now I'm right back where I started - just an extra girl having breakfast with a director, only I didn't use to have breakfast with 'em.
Maybe that was my trouble.
Did they ever ask you to?
No.
Well, then don't pat yourself on the back.
Take me with you.
What?
On your experiment. I don't want to be sent home.
Don't be childish. I'll tell you what I'll do.
You can stay here for a couple of weeks like I told you and when I get back I'll see what I can do for you.
I don't want to start all that stuff again.
Take me with you.
When you get as far as you're going, we can say goodbye, and I'll go the rest of the way alone.
It'll make a nice ending.
We'll finish what we started this morning.
That's absolutely out of the question.
Please.
You don't know anything about anything.
You don't know how to get a meal, you can't keep a secret,
you can't even stay out of town.
Thanks!
I know 50 times as much about trouble as you ever will.
Besides, you owe it to me. You sort of belong to me.
When you were a hobo, I found you.
Piffle.
Please.
I tell you it's out of the question.
I'll throw you in the water.
You take my mind off my work.
Oh-ho! The big director that has all the girls panting for him.
I'll follow you and tell everybody who you are, like a kid sister.
You'll follow me!
Yes, I'll follow you, and I'll holler,
This guy's a phoney, ladies and gentlemen,
this is Sullivan, the big director from Hollywood.
A phonus balonus, a faker, a..."
If I may join in the controversy, sir, I think it's an excellent suggestion.
Well, you may not join in the controversy.
I will! I'm going with you!
You'll do nothing of the kind.
Would you get me some tramp clothes?
Certainly, miss.
Go to the station and get a ticket to...
Where do you live?
I won't tell you. I won't be sent home.
You stop that. Stop that.
Grab her feet!
Oh!
Yes, sir, certainly, sir.
Now, miss...
Let get of me!
Let go of me!
Please, miss!
Mr Burrows! This way, Mr Burrows!
There we are. Now... one, two, three! Pull!
Hello, information?
Have you any freight trains going east this afternoon or early this evening?
5:48? Thank you very much indeed, sir.
Oh, and could you tell me, does that train carry tramps, and if so, where do they get on?
What?
It's on page two.
What did you say?
Tramps.
How would you like to take a flying?
Wise guy.
Yes, sir?
What was that again?
I wonder if you'd be kind enough to settle a bet for us?
Just a few of us here at the club.
If a tramp were to board your 5:48 this afternoon, from where would he board it?
I see, I see, yes.
But not within the yard limits.
I think that gives me the complete picture.
Thank you very much for your trouble. Oh, and by the way -
I win. Good day.
A different approach to the same problem.
I think this is it, sir.
Why don't you go back with the car?
You look as much like a boy as Mae West.
All right, they'll think I'm your frail.
I believe it's called a beazel, miss.
Well, goodbye, Burrows.
Goodbye, sir. Goodbye, miss.
May I close, sir, by warning you against the entire expedition, which I envision with deep apprehension and gloomy foreboding?
Thanks. Same to you. Come on.
Jump!
Come on, here. Let me help you.
Lift me up!
I got you!
We made it.
We're on.
Amateurs.
Oh, how do you do?
Beautiful weather.
If it doesn't rain.
How do you feel about the labour situation?
Oh, where are you going?
I hope we didn't disturb you.
Very interesting couple.
Yeah.
Do you smell anything?
I certainly do.
What's it smell like to you?
Hogs.
That's what I was afraid of.
I'm getting hungry.
How can you possibly be hungry when you just ate?
I'm not a scientist.
All I know is I'm hungry.
You'd better tell the porter to close the window.
I didn't ask you to come along in the first place.
Don't start daking wisecracks.
Doe, sir.
Blasted draft in here at dat.
Where is this train going?
I don't know.
How long's it take to get there?
I didn't ask you to come along.
I think that's a perfectly reasonable question.
Haven't you got enough imagination to pretend we're broke, hungry, homeless, drifting in despair?
Now let's just sit here and try to feel like a couple of tramps.
Cold?
I'll be all right.
It's the desert.
I'll be all right.
As soon as this blasted thing comes to a town someplace
I'll send for a car and have you taken home.
It's a lot of hokey balokey. This is a terrible way to travel with a girl.
It's better with a girl than without one. You would have frozen to death.
If I go back, would you go back with me?
Donsense.
Then I won't go back either.
You're so simple, you're apt to get in a lot of trouble.
What do you think I'm out here for?
Gee, I like that about you.
You're like those knights of old who used to ride around looking for trouble.
Who was it that rode on a pure white horse?
Lady Godiba.
She must've been a nut. I bet her husband was sore.
Are you jealous?
Why don't you shut up and try to get some sleep?
Will you go to sleep too?
I'll try.
Why don't you try counting the hogs jumping over a hedge.
Listen, short-breeches...
What's that?
Dothing, just be.
What?
I sdeezed.
You what?
I... I sdeezed.
Oh, you poor darling.
Have you got hay fever?
I think it's hog fever.
Oh, you poor lamb.
I'll be all right as soon as the sun gets a little warmer.
Are you hud-gry?
You got me doing it!
We got any eating money?
Ten cents.
Can we spend it for breakfast or are you saving it for something?
Look, I've already told you I'll send for a car for you...
I can't help it if I'm good-natured.
I like to be with you, and it puts me in a good humour.
You take lots of girls and you make them sleep in a hog sty all night and then don't tell them where their breakfast was coming from - they wouldn't take it lying down.
Oh, we'll find some breakfast somewhere.
In some swill pail I suppose.
Well, what do the other bums do?
They steal chickings... Chickens.
They roast 'em over campfires with baked potatoes and green corn on the cob with melted butter and...
Shut up.
Where do they get the butter?
They steal it.
They don't. It isn't as easy as all that.
There's a lot of suffering that ordinary people don't know anything about.
Now what's the matter?
I'm hungry.
Well...
Hey, there's a town up ahead. Let's get off and see what happens.
What town is it?
I don't know. I suppose it's Hollywood.
Look, there's a lunch stand.
Come on.
Well, come on, I can't keep running along here all day.
Here I come.
Just a minute.
Well, come on.
Did I hurt you any?
Well, you didn't do me any good.
Come on.
Cup of coffee and sinker for one.
I never eat till noon. It gives me indigestion.
Just make that two coffees.
That'll be ten cents.
That's all right.
It's right here someplace.
Holy Boses.
What's the matter?
I must've spent it in that owl wagon.
I'll never get rich.
Oh, gee.
You're a little richer than you were.
Hundreds of miles from everything, cut off from the world, a taste of human kindness.
I'll never forget it as long as I live.
What town is this?
Las Vegas, Nevada.
Las Vegas, Nevada. This is the Busy Bee.
Las Vegas? You mean Las Vegas?
What about it?
Is there a land yacht waiting here?
Land yacht? You mean that thing?
That's perfectly wonderful, Mr Sullivan, I rejoice in your experience.
Where does this gentleman live?
Just up there.
Give him $100.
A great human interest story.
It'll probably ruin him.
He'll give turkey dinners to every slug and never hit the jackpot again.
All right. Buy the kid here a few clothes and meet me in Kansas City.
Someplace near the station. I'm going the hard way.
So long, gang. Oh!
Just a minute, please. Sit down.
But listen, Doc!
You listen.
It's three days in bed, minimum.
This is just a cold shot. You won't even feel it.
I haven't time to spend three days in bed.
You'll take the time.
You'll get to Kansas City just as soon.
And you can imagine that you went there in your... cow snatcher.
Haven't you got any imagination?
Here's something for you.
What's that?
It's Christmas. So long!
Come in!
Here's a wrapper for you, and slippers.
What?
A wrapper.
Oh. Thanks!
There's make-up in the medicine cabinet.
Oh, thanks, I can use it.
You sure can.
Yes, sir, Mr LeBrand, he's right here in the next room, taking a little snooze.
He looks great. This whole thing is doing him a power of good.
Come in.
Hello. Feel better?
No, I'm sore.
Nothing the matter with me but a little fever.
Even if I did get sick, they could've sent me to a free hospital.
Would've been very interesting.
They give you a nice free burial too.
Free burial.
Why does everybody exaggerate everything so much?
I've got a little cold in my head. You take a dose of salts, there you are.
It's because you're a very valuable man.
Bushwa.
You make lovely pictures.
Phooey.
Well, you do.
It's a funny thing how everything keeps shoving me back to Hollywood or Beverly Hills.
Or this monstrosity we're riding in.
Almost like gravity.
As if some force were saying, "Get back where you belong.
You don't belong out here in real life, you phoney, you."
You're a little feverish.
Maybe there's a universal law that says,
Stay put, as you are so shall you remain."
Maybe that's why tramps are always in trouble.
They don't vote, they don't pay taxes. They violate the law of nature.
You look very pretty in that outfit.
Maybe that's why they don't want trailer colonies. Or am I getting a bit profound?
You're getting a bit hot.
Your hand is very cool.
But nothing is gonna stop me.
I'm gonna find out how it feels to be in trouble, without friends, without credit, without chequebook, without name... alone.
And I'll go with you.
How could I be alone if you're with me?
Yes, sir, Mr LeBrand, it's all finished.
The greatest expedition of modern times.
Almost the greatest sacrifice ever made by human man.
Good morning, Toby.
Yes, ma'am.
Good morning.
Good morning.
He's all washed up, except tonight he's going for a quick tour.
He's taking $1,000 in five-dollar bills and he's going to hand them out to these tramps in gratitude for what they've done for him.
Now is that a story?
Does that give you a lump in your throat or does that give you a lump in your throat?
Hello.
Hello. Tired?
No, no, I was just... thinking.
Well, here we are at the end of the adventure.
I'll go down tonight and give 'em a little money and that winds it up.
Now what do you wanna do?
Do you want to go home or do you want to take another crack at Hollywood?
Well, I...
With a nice fat letter to Lubitsch.
I'd sort of like to... go where you go.
I mean, I'd sort of hoped that you'd... you'd want us to go on together a little longer now that we kind of got used to each other.
Of course I would, if I wasn't married.
Who's married?
Well, didn't you know that?
I thought everyone had heard of my misfortune.
Of course I didn't.
What do you mean, "Of course I didn't"?
As if I'd snatched you away from your loving grandmother.
Are you in love with her?
That vulture?
Then why marry her?
Income tax.
It was supposed to save me $24,000 a year.
It's what's called a joint return, it's California law.
Each one pays half, and the total is less than the aggregate surtax if the surtax is less than something or other.
It was an idea of my business manager's.
Well, I think it's disgusting.
It wasn't supposed to be romantic, it was supposed to save $12,000 a year.
But it didn't. Turned out she couldn't live on 12,000 a year.
Good.
Lovely. - She had to have 24,000 to live on.
Good.
Don't keep saying "good" all the time, or I'll poke you in the nose.
Good.
Now listen. So I demanded the divorce she'd promised me.
And she told you to go fry an egg?
She said it would break her mother's heart.
Some fine advice your business manager gave you.
I found out why - he was getting half.
And you really can't get a divorce ever?
Never. You can't divorce without collusion, and she won't collude.
I... guess I... ought to go home, then.
You could still have that letter to Lubitsch.
Could I... still come and push you in the pool sometimes?
Of course you could.
Guess that's better than nothing.
There, there, there, my gracious.
Here are the five-dollar bills, Mr Sullivan.
Hello, Johnny.
Get me two tickets on the midnight plane.
Two tickets?
Oh, two tickets!
Oh, yes, indeed, Mr Sullivan.
They're pretty, aren't they?
Uh-huh.
You want one?
Yes.
Here. You can have two of them.
Did you cancel the plane tickets?
They cancelled themselves.
I'm gonna give him just 15 minutes more, and then...
I'm sure he's all right.
Probably just got interested in a revival meeting or something and...
Hello?
Yes, Doc.
Not in the hospitals, huh?
Sure. I guess that's all you can do.
Anyway, he didn't have an accident.
Hello?
He isn't, huh?
Val has covered the police stations.
OK.
I guess you can come back now.
I should have gone with him. I knew he'd get into trouble without me.
I'm gonna give him just 12 minutes more and then I'm gonna lay it in LeBrand's lap and let him figure it out.
Sully'll be sore if you raise a big holler...
Let him be sore. I got a job too.
If LeBrand found out...
He came back last time.
He didn't have people waiting for him.
You don't know him like I know him. - Is that so?
Yeah?
Say, I'm down here at the morgue.
They got a guy in a basket, you can't tell who he is.
Did the boss have any identification?
Did he have any identification that you know of?
He had...
I think he said he had...
Who's that?
Have they found him?
Take it easy, will you?
What identification did he have?
In the soles of his shoes.
I think there was a... a card between the soles of his shoes.
Look in the soles of his shoes, between the leather.
He's coming now, I can hear his footsteps.
There's a card here, it's hard to read, it's all splattered.
He's dead?
What do you mean?
What do you think it means?
Why do you send him on jobs like this?
Do you think I like it?
I will sue you. I'll teach you to...
Operator, I was talking with Kansas City.
They're gonna sue me. - Heh!
I suppose I ought to fire the whole bunch of you.
Somehow I don't feel like firing anybody.
Get your things together and leave this afternoon!
I'll fly back.
Uh, yes, sir, uh...
I'd like you to come with us, my dear.
Jones has explained to me.
You were his last discovery.
His last gift to the world.
We'll take care of you always.
She didn't hear you.
What's the idea riding into the yard?
I said, what's the idea riding into the brake yard?
Oh, lay off, will you?
I'll run you in for trespass.
Shut up, you dumb cluck. Can't you see I'm sick?
Come on, get out of here, you dirty rat.
Come on, go on.
Don't do that again.
That's telling him, Bull.
Don't do what again?
Come on. Come on, get going.
Trespass, resisting arrest, atrocious assault with intent to kill.
Huh?
What? What'd he say?
We object, your honour. My client had been injured...
Objection overruled.
Trespass and resisting arrest.
Objection. The man was not an officer of the law.
Sustained.
Trespass and atrocious assault.
Objection, your honour.
Objection overruled. Get down to business.
Prisoner at the bar. Prisoner at the bar!
Answer when you're spoken to.
Do you plead guilty or not guilty?
Huh?
Guilty or not guilty to trespass and atrocious assault with a rock upon the employee of the railroad.
I guess I hit him all right, the way my hand feels.
I'm sorry, I'll... make it up to you. I'll... pay any damages you like. Sorry.
So you still refuse to give your name?
It'll... come back to me in a minute,
I... have such an awful headache. I'm all mixed up.
We plead guilty, with extenuating circumstances due to temporary insanity.
Huh?
What? What'd he say?
Stand up.
Stand up!
Stand up.
These are parlous times and we have no desire to be severe.
Just a minute, I...
Silence!
When confronted with violence, the court has no alternative.
Since you refuse to remember your name but have pleaded guilty,
I will be as lenient as my conscience permits, and will not impose upon you the maximum penalty that your crimes permit.
Richard Roe, I sentence you to six years of hard labour as described by the laws of our sovereign state.
Six years?
What's he talking about?
You get off easy.
I gotta get to a phone.
I have to send a...
Come on.
Wait a minute. I'm all mixed up here.
Come on. Come on.
Mister! New man.
Hello, Charlie.
Hi, Jake.
Put him in 13.
Just a minute...
You speak when you're spoken to!
If you want anything, hold up your arm.
Listen, you...
You call me "mister".
Put him in 13 and find him a bunk.
Come on!
Wait a minute, wait a minute. Them cost me $16.50.
Another Richard Roe, eh?
There seems to be a lot of them.
How's everything up at the house?
Fine, Jake.
Give my regards to the missus.
I'll do that little thing.
I gotta get outta here.
Take it easy, boy.
Listen, I'm John L. Sullivan, a Hollywood director.
Somebody slugged me. I gotta get out of here.
A Hollywood what?
Take it easy, you're gonna lose your privilege - no letters, no smokes, no writing.
You don't want that.
Listen, I want a lawyer.
You get me to a telephone.
There's a telephone right down there.
Can't do things like this to people - put 'em in a pigsty.
Pipe down, will you, please? Before he hears.
I want a lawyer. I demand my right to have a lawyer.
Did you hear that?
He demands a lawyer!
You starting in again?
You're gonna be here a long time, see, and you gotta learn, and learn quick.
Chain him.
No privilege, fresh guy.
We're going to the picture show Sunday.
Good news - you wanna see the picture show Sunday?
We're... We're going to the picture show.
We're going to the picture show Sunday.
When can I write a letter?
When you get your privilege back.
How long'll that take?
That all depends on the mister.
He's all right if you take it nice and quiet.
How long's it take him to make up his mind?
Take it easy or you'll never get it.
Look out.
Who gave you leave to read the paper? You won't learn, huh?
It's about me. I just happened to see it.
Shut up. Turn around!
Turn around!
Put your hands behind you.
Put him in the sweatbox.
For how long, mister?
Till I tell you to let him out.
Are you gonna start now?
No, sir.
Yes, sir. I mean no, sir.
Well, then get moving!
Get back to your work.
What do you think this is - a vaudeville show?
Tastes good, don't it?
I'll try to get him to let you off early.
I ain't supposed to do this.
Please... Water...
You'll be all right. You gotta learn, that's all.
It ain't so easy at first but after a while you don't mind.
We ain't so bad off.
He ain't bad according to his lights, has to deal with some tough hombres.
Got us chicken last Thanksgiving, and some turkey once for Christmas.
And there ain't another mister takes his gang to the picture show.
Maybe...
Maybe if I ask him he'll let you go to the picture show Sunday.
Wouldn't that be something?
Huh?
Go ahead, Charlie.
Let it down easy, Charlie.
Charlie's a little anxious.
Well, brothers and sisters, once again we're going to have a little entertainment.
I guess I don't have to tell you what it is - the sheet kind of gives it away.
And once again, brothers and sisters, we're going to share our pleasure with some neighbours less fortunate than ourselves.
Won't you please clear the first three pews so they may have seats?
And when they get here, I'm going to ask you once more, neither by word, nor by action, nor by look, to make our guests feel unwelcome, or draw away from them, or act high-toned.
For we is all equal in the sight of God.
Amen.
And he said, "Let him who is without sin cast the first stone."
The chains shall be struck from them.
And the lame shall leap. - Yes.
And the blind shall see! - Yes!
And glory in the coming of the Lord! - Yes!
Now let's give our guests a little welcome.
♪ When Israel was in Egypt land
♪ Let my people go
♪ Oppressed so hard they could not stand
♪ Let my people go
♪ Go down, Moses
♪ Way down in Egypt land... ♪
♪ Tell old pharaoh

♪ Then Israel out of Egypt came

Will those nearest the lights kindly rise and dim them, please?
I do.
Hey.
Yeah?
Am I laughing? - What?
You don't suppose this is a gag, do you?
He'd have to be Houdini to get out of that.
I wouldn't put it past him.
Don't you understand?
They think I'm dead, but I'm not dead.
That's fine. Just think what a nice surprise they'll have when you get out.
I haven't time to spend six years.
But you were sentenced.
I know that, but I still haven't time.
Well, you'll have to find the time.
They don't sentence picture directors to a place like this for a little disagreement with a yard bull.
Don't they?
No.
Well, maybe you ain't a picture director.
Huh?
Maybe that idea just come to you when you got hit on the head.
Maybe. - Now look...
We used to have a fella here once that thought he was Lindbergh.
He used to fly away every night.
But he was always back in the morning.
Don't I look like a picture director?
Course, I never seen one.
To me you look kinda more like a soda jerk or maybe a plasterer maybe.
But...
If ever a plot needed a twist, this one does.
Huh?
I gotta get my picture in the paper.
Oh, that'd be swell. You could paste it over your bunk...
What kind of people get their pictures in the paper?
Ball players.
Girls.
They take them with their legs crossed. I cut one out once.
She had a... She was sitting...
No?
Well, when you die. If you was important enough.
I've had that.
Murderers.
There was a swell picture of a friend of mine.
He was a lodge brother. They called him the blowtorch killer.
That's it. That's it!
You tell the mister I'm ready to make a full confession.
Now wait a minute!
Come on!
Now take it easy.
There isn't a moment to lose.
My conscience has gotten me.
I wanna confess to the murder of John L. Sullivan.
I killed John L. Sullivan!
Wait a minute!
I murdered John L. Sullivan!
I'm telling you, you're doing the wrong thing!
I'm a murderer.
Will you listen to me?
I killed John L. Sullivan!
I said, I'm so happy.
What?
Your wife got married last week.
Who got buried last week?
She got married last week.
My wife?
Did you say they buried her?
She got married. She married your business manager.
She married him?
Yes!
He married her?
Yes!
But how?
Because you were dead.
Dead?
Dead!
Do you suppose she'll give you a divorce?
Give it to me?
She'll beg me for it!
She's got to give me a divorce, otherwise it's bigamy, unfaithfulness, alienation of affections, corpus delicti.
...run such risks!
And then you'll be free.
And then I'll be free.
But not for long, I hope.
Just a moment, gentlemen!
Sully, O Brother, Where Art Thou?
is going to be the greatest tragedy ever.
The world will weep! Humanity will sob!
It'll put Shakespeare back with the shipping news.
Your personal courage, your sacrifice in sampling the dregs of vicissitude Will make O Brother a...
I'm sorry to disappoint you, and I say it with some embarrassment, but I don't want to make O Brother, Where Art Thou?
You don't want to make it?
No. I say it with some embarrassment. I wanna make a comedy.
You say it with some embarrassment?
He doesn't want to make O Brother, he wants to make a comedy.
He don't mean that, boss, he's still a little stir crazy.
Oh yes, I do. Oh no, I'm not.
You are joking, aren't you, Sully?
No.
But it's had more publicity than the Johnstown flood.
What are we gonna do with that?
Oh, brother.
Why don't you want to make O Brother, Where Art Thou, Sully?
In the first place, I'm too happy to make O Brother, Where Art Thou?
In the second place, I haven't suffered enough to make it.
You haven't suffered enough?
But Sully...
I'll tell you something else.
There's a lot to be said for making people laugh.
Did you know that's all some people have?
It isn't much, but it's better than nothing in this cockeyed caravan.
Boy...
I beg your pardon. Was that your leg?
I had no idea we were going into a tunnel.
I thought the compartment was empty.
I'm so sorry. I hope I didn't hurt you.
Awful man in the next compartment smoking a vile cigar.
I had to come in here.
You don't smoke, do you?
No, I don't.
Thank heavens for that.
After last night, my head couldn't stand it.
You understand....
May I see your tickets, please?
Thank you, miss.
I'm afraid you're in the wrong compartment, sir.
It's a first-class compartment, isn't it?
Yes.
Then I'm all right.
It's a third-class ticket.
What sort of line is this, selling third-class tickets at first-class prices?
I am very sorry, sir. That will be £5.04 extra.
You haven't change for a fiver, have you?
Don't bother, because I haven't got one.
This is the best I can do.
Do you suppose the line would settle for £5 and tuppence ha'penny?
No, I don't suppose they would.
I hate to presume on our short acquaintance, but have you any change?
I'm afraid that I....
There you are. That'll do. That stamp.
Thank you very much.
There you are, £5 and tuppence ha'penny and three ha'pence. £5.04.
It's legal tender, old boy.
Write to your mother.
That man.
Mr. Aysgarth, may I?
Would you mind stepping forward a little bit, Mrs. Fitzpatrick? Thank you.
Now, Mr. Aysgarth, please.
I wonder if I could have a little bit more of your smile?
Not at this hour of the morning.
There he is. Good morning, Johnnie. - How are you?
We've been looking for you everywhere.
Everywhere. Excuse me. If it's possible at all, would you mind?
Of course. I'm so sorry.
See you later, Johnnie.
Goodbye. - Come, Alice.
Come, Jessie.
Thank you very much.
Aren't they bright this morning? Now.
That's very good.
Now could I have a little bit of a smile? You remember.
I can hardly believe it. It can't be the same girl.
What's her name?
Yes, but lay off, Johnnie. You've enough on your hands for one day.
Besides, she's not up your alley.
To tell you the truth, I'm a little bored with people in my alley.
Introduce me to her, will you?
Certainly not.
She's a very carefully brought up young lady.
If you won't do it, I'll have to do it myself.
Come on, they're going.
Lina, may we come in?
I'm sorry. I didn't see you.
How are you?
Splendid.
May I introduce Mr. Aysgarth?
How do you do?
How do you do?
We were just passing by and we saw you in the window.
Johnnie insisted on meeting you.
Why?
I'm told the sight of a really eligible male is a rare treat in this part of the country.
Isn't Johnnie terrible?
He's too fantastic for words.
Aren't you, Johnnie?
Hadn't you better hurry?
Hurry for what?
You don't want to be late for church.
Did you all come to take me to church?
No, but that is....
If you want to come....
Naturally, we'd love to have you.
That's very kind of you.
I think I will come.
Good.
And put on that saucy little hat you wore on the train the other day.
I will. Excuse me.
I'll be down in a moment.
We'd better sit down, girls.
Where are you rushing to?
To church, Mother.
But I thought--
I've changed my mind.
Shall I go with you?
I'm going with the Barhams.
I thought you didn't like them.
I loathe them.
Really, it's most extraordinary.
You're not really going to church?
I certainly am.
No, you're coming for a walk with me.
Don't be ridiculous.
Tell you what I'll do, I'll toss you for it. Heads you do, tails you don't.
Mother.
Now what did you think I was trying to do, kill you?
Nothing less than murder could justify such violent self-defense. - Look at you.
Let me go.
I'm just beginning to understand.
You thought I was going to kiss you.
Weren't you?
Of course not. I was merely reaching around you, trying to fix your hair.
What's wrong with my hair?
I'm glad you asked me that.
It would have been very discourteous for me to bring the subject up.
Are you serious?
Of course I'm serious.
I may seem provincial, but frankly, I can't understand men like you.
You always give me the feeling that you're laughing at me.
No, I give you my word.
But your hair's all wrong.
It has such wonderful possibilities that I got excited.
For the moment, I became a passionate hairdresser.
What's wrong with it?
Let me show you.
Let me see....
Don't do that.
Why not?
Because your ucipital mapilary is quite beautiful.
What's an ucipital mapilary?
That.
You don't need to touch it.
Let's see.
That's good.
I must be quite a novelty by contrast with the women... that you're photographed with.
What do you think of me by contrast to your horse?
If I ever got the bit between your teeth, I'd have no trouble in handling you at all.
Suppose just as you thought you had me under control...
I turned around, neighed, and kissed you?
I think you've done enough fooling with my hair.
You don't look very good like that.
You look more like a monkey with a bit of mirror.
What does your family call you?
I still think my way was best.
I must go now or I'll be late to luncheon.
If my father saw me come in both late and beautiful, he might have a stroke.
Please don't bother to come any further.
I'll be back for you at 3:00.
No, really, I can't come out this afternoon.
Yes, you can.
No, really, I have to make calls with my mother.
Liar.
Really.
Don't forget, 3:00.
Lina will never marry. She's not the marrying sort.
She has no need to worry. There's enough to care for her the rest of her life.
I suppose you're right, dear. I'm afraid she's rather spinsterish.
What's wrong with that?
The old maid's a respectable institution.
All women are not alike.
Lina has intellect and a fine solid character.
Come on, I'm hungry.
Sorry I'm late.
Could I have some well-done, please, Burton?
Yes, miss.
What kept you so long at church, dear?
I didn't go to church. I went for a walk. Thank you, Burton.
With a man.
A man?
Yes. His name's John Aysgarth.
John Aysgarth?
Is that Tom Aysgarth's boy?
How'd you meet him?
Pity he's turned out so wild. Rough luck on Tom.
What's this, horseradish?
Didn't know horseradish was in season.
It's not out of a bottle, is it?
Of course not, dear.
That's real. I can tell the difference at once.
I can't stand things out of bottles. They never taste the same.
Never, dear.
Why did you say that John Aysgarth was wild, Father?
He was turned out of some club for cheating at cards, wasn't he?
I don't know. I didn't ask him.
Or ought to have been. Something unpleasant anyway.
What's he doing down here?
Staying at Penshaze.
Lord Middleham wouldn't have him there... if he had been turned out of a club for cheating.
Maybe it wasn't cards.
Maybe a woman.
He was corespondent or something, I believe... or ought to have been corespondent.
You can't expect me to remember every detail about everybody.
Anyway, I'm going to see him again.
He's calling for me this afternoon at 3:00.
You're wanted on the telephone, miss.
Hello?
Hello, Johnnie.
You can't?
Of course, I understand.
Thank you for calling.
I'd love to, next time you come down again.
Hello?
Is Mr. John Aysgarth there, please?
He isn't?
I thought perhaps....
Are you expecting him for the Hunt Ball?
This is....
It doesn't matter. I'll ring again.
Nothing, Miss McLaidlaw.
Are you sure?
Positive.
I don't want to be a nuisance... but couldn't it accidentally have been put into somebody else's letter box?
I'm sorry, I'm sure it would have been returned if that had happened.
Thank you.
Regent 0021, please.
No reply?
Thank you.
Lina.
Hello, Mother.
It's 7:00.
Aren't you going to wear your new dress?
No, Mother. I'm not in the mood.
What's the matter, dear?
My head's splitting.
I'm not going to the ball.
Not going? You mean....
What'll your father say?
Perhaps some aspirin....
You haven't a temperature, have you?
I don't know.
Yes, come in.
Where's your aspirin? I'll get it.
In my bureau drawer.
A telegram for you, miss.
Thank you.
Here's the aspirin, dear.
What for?
Your headache.
That's gone.
Tell Father I'll be down in a second.
Really, I don't understand you.
I say, Lina.
Yes, Reggie?
What about our dance?
Why, of course. Poor Reggie.
Good.
I say, General, that's not Lina dancing with Wetherby, is it?
Yes, it is.
By Jove, I didn't recognize her at first.
I hardly knew her myself.
There's somebody at the door for General McLaidlaw.
There's somebody to see you at the door.
This is General McLaidlaw.
I beg your pardon, sir. There's a gentleman at the door who says he's with your party.
He has no card, sir. The name is Aysgarth.
Aysgarth?
Must be a mistake.
General McLaidlaw?
I'm John Aysgarth.
I don't recall having invited you in my party.
How awkward. I thought you had.
Otherwise I should never have come all the way from London.
I don't know what to say.
I suggest you say something before you embarrass this poor man to death.
Hello, Johnnie.
Hello, Lina.
Hello, Johnnie.
We were wondering if you were coming.
I'm sorry I'm late. I believe this is our dance, isn't it?
Hello, Monkeyface.
Hello.
But we can't do this. Where are we going?
Which is your car?
This is ridiculous.
Over there.
Good. Come on.
Roll up the window before you catch cold.
Have you ever been kissed in a car before?
Johnnie.
Johnnie what?
You mustn't joke with me.
I'm no good at joking. - I don't know how to flirt.
I'm not joking. I'm serious.
Have you ever been kissed in a car?
Never.
Would you like to be?
Yes.
You're the first woman I've ever met who said yes when she meant yes.
What do the others say?
Hanged if I know. Anything but yes.
But they kiss you?
Usually.
Have there....
Have there what, Monkeyface?
Have there been many?
I'm afraid so. Quite a few.
One night, when I couldn't fall asleep, I started to count them.
The way you count sheep jumping over a fence.
I think I passed out on number 73.
Are you always frank with them like this?
No, not particularly.
Why are you frank with me, because I'm different?
No, it isn't that.
I'm honest because with you I think it's the best way to get results.
I hope I'm not saying the wrong thing, but I love you.
No, you haven't said the wrong thing, Monkeyface.
Where are we going?
I don't know, anywhere.
I think I'm falling in love with you and I don't quite like it.
That's why I stayed away from you for a week. I was afraid of you.
I didn't think it would happen like this.
Neither did I. I saw an entirely different sort of person.
So did I.
I pictured it all rather conventionally.
We'd meet at a garden party, he'd call on me in the evenings... and we'd go for rides together, and then afterward we'd....
We're coming to my house. Would you like to stop for a drink?
No.
I'm going to get you back to that ball as fast as possible.
Get out.
Why have you stopped?
I'm sure I don't know.
Come on.
Good evening, Burton.
I saw you coming up the drive, miss.
We won't be needing you. We just stopped in for a drink.
Very good.
Shall we go in the study?
You sit down. I'll mix you a drink. I think you need one.
You must be made of iron.
Why?
How can you be so calm?
Look at me. I'm shaking.
The least you could do is swoon away.
I know. I'm rather surprised myself.
I think it's because for the first time in my life...
I know what I want.
Are you courting me?
I'm afraid I am.
This is a wonderful moment.
Here we are in my home, the house that I was born in... alone and together in my favorite room.
Do you like this room?
Very much.
Well, what are you doing here?
I say, old boy, isn't that going a bit too far?
He doesn't like me.
I know.
He doesn't trust me from here to there.
You're right.
Stop it before it's too late.
Tell her everything you're thinking.
That I'm no good to her, I can only bring her unhappiness.
Warn her. Speak up, man. It's your last chance.
Hear him?
Very distinctly.
He's not exaggerating a thing, dear.
It's all true, every word he isn't saying.
I love him, Father.
Did you see him jump?
I did.
Watch this one.
Sir, I have the honor of asking for your daughter's hand in marriage.
What do you say to that?
You heard him that time, didn't you?
It doesn't matter.
Poor Monkeyface.
Do you hear the music?
Very clearly.
Let's dance, before I.... Before we....
Let's dance.
I was just going down to the post.
Could you stop at Marshall's and get me more of this green wool?
Where'd I put it?
Here it is.
Be sure it's the same green. Better take it out into the daylight.
Yes, Mother.
Is there anything I can do for you?
No, there's nothing I want.
Don't be late for tea, dear.
That trunk goes up on the landing.
How do you like it, Mrs. Aysgarth?
If you don't like it, just blame it all on Mr. Bailey.
He rented it during our honeymoon. He decorated the place.
But if you do like it--
I adore it. I'm mad about it. It's wonderful.
In that case, you're talking to the right man. - Because I engaged Mr. Bailey, didn't I?
Yes, Mr. Aysgarth. That's true, I must say.
Johnnie, you're a genius.
Mr. Aysgarth, I shall have to be getting along now.
What shall we do about the bill?
Will you drop it on that pretty little table on your way out, old boy?
Yes. Thank you.
And may I wish you both the very best of everything.
Thank you.
Goodbye, Mr. Bailey.
I never dreamt I would have such a gorgeous place.
Are you sure you can afford it?
I've forgotten your name.
Ethel, sir.
Well, Ethel, what about some tea?
Very good, sir.
What do you think of Ethel?
She seems perfect. - Are you sure--
Let's go in the drawing room.
Where are we?
The Hunt Ball.
Where else?
Venice.
And?
And Naples, and Capri, and Monte Carlo, and Nice.
And?
Paris.
I beg your pardon. A telegram for you, sir.
Thank you, Ethel.
It isn't bad news, is it, dear?
An old friend of mine. Stupid fellow, he wants £1,000.
You couldn't spare £1,000, could you?
What does he want it for?
Hanged if I know.
Probably because I borrowed it from him.
You borrowed it?
Why?
I was going on a honeymoon with the loveliest girl in the world... and I wanted her to be happy.
Didn't you have any money of your own?
Not a shilling.
But I thought.... I had the impression....
Don't worry your darling little head about it today of all days.
I'll take care of old Henry somehow.
I still don't understand.
Are you broke?
Monkeyface, I've been broke all my life.
Why didn't you tell me?
Every time I brought the subject up, you....
Whatever made you take this extravagant house?
I didn't think you'd want to live in a shack.
A girl like you is going to come into plenty of money someday.
Wait a minute, I can't quite get this into my head.
Were you thinking of my inheritance when....
I don't know what to say.
Now, darling, really.
Isn't it silly to spend the best years of our lives waiting?
Why not be comfortable now?
Johnnie...
I'm just beginning to understand you.
You're a baby.
I know you didn't marry me for my money.
You'd have done much better elsewhere.
But my income will never pay for all this. Never.
What about your father?
I couldn't possibly ask my father. Or even my mother.
You saw how restrained she was when she met us at the station.
Anyway, you wouldn't actually want to live on your wife's allowance?
Of course not, darling.
Well, then?
Answer me, Johnnie.
I suppose if the worst comes to the worst and there's no other way out...
I suppose I'll have to....
What?
Borrow some more. I haven't touched old Middleham yet.
He ought to be good for a month or two's housekeeping.
I think you must be mad.
Marrying you is the sanest thing I ever did in my life.
Come on, give it to me. - That's too heavy for a little girl like you.
Thank you, sir.
Clear off the table.
Here, take that. Is there any cake?
Yes, sir.
Go along, get it.
Here, dear.
Thank you.
There's going to be no more borrowing.
What else is there to do?
You've got to go to work.
Work?
Yes, work.
You mean put on old clothes, go out with a shovel?
Don't be flippant.
Then what do you mean?
I'm afraid you're a bit of a dreamer.
Let's be practical about this.
Do you know the statistics on unemployment?
Do you realize in order to be a plumber, or a carpenter, or an electrician....
Darling, you haven't been around. They have to be apprentices first. Even after that....
Darling.
There are all sorts of jobs.
I'm broad-minded. Let's have some tea and then talk it over.
I could make out a list of jobs.
I'll get a pencil and paper. Excuse me, dear.
It's right there behind you.
Hello?
Hello, Mother.
Yes, it's wonderful. A most beautiful house.
Would you tell Father how badly I felt?
He is?
Wait a minute till I tell Johnnie.
Father's sending us a wedding present.
Mother told him how happy I looked and....
I can't tell you how much this means to me.
Me, too. - Yes.
Father?
Come on, ask him when he's sending it.
It's coming right away, by messenger.
Invite them over for dinner.
Perhaps he'd like to play some golf.
Tell him that we were in the throes of job-hunting when he telephoned.
It doesn't hurt to impress the old boy.
Really, you are the limit.
How can you be so gay about something... that you should be ashamed of?
What, Father?
Yes, Johnnie and I were just having... a sober and comprehensive discussion of that very subject.
He has several ideas of the kind of job he'd like to do... and several good opportunities.
There's a messenger from General McLaidlaw.
Bring it in.
It's just come, Father. Hold on, do.
I think I know what it is, and if it is what I think it is...
Johnnie, you'll be thrilled.
It is! How wonderful.
We've had them in the family before I was born.
Father's had lots of offers to sell them, but he never would.
How many more, for heaven's sake?
Just these two, sir.
He sent us both of them.
These are Father's most precious possessions.
You don't say.
These will be our first heirlooms to be handed down to our children... - and then to their children.
That's the thing to do with them, all right.
Father, you're so good to me that you make me want to cry.
What was that?
Yes, you've made me very happy.
You've made Johnnie very happy, too.
Just a minute, he wants to say something.
Say something very nice. These chairs really belong in a museum.
Hello, General.
Yes, but really, shouldn't you have sent them to a museum?
Naturally we're thrilled. Who wouldn't be?
What, a job?
Yes, Lina and I were just going into that.
I have some excellent opportunities.
What are they?
I've just received a letter from my cousin, Captain Melbeck.
Yes, he is a splendid chap.
He wants someone to manage his estate. I thought I'd take the job.
I'm glad you approve.
Yes, we must. We'll get together soon.
I'll leave it up to Lina, shall I?
All right. Goodbye, sir.
That was a fib about Captain Melbeck, wasn't it?
Was it?
Did you have this letter all the time?
I did.
Why didn't you tell me?
Because, dear, I never dreamed I'd be using it... any more than I ever dreamed we'd be receiving these two beautiful chairs.
Hello. It's a nice place old Johnnie's got here.
It's an old Georgian house, isn't it?
I bet it cost him a packet to redecorate.
Who are you?
I'm Beaky Thwaite.
You must be old Johnnie's wife.
Yes, I am.
Didn't he ever tell you about me?
You're Beaky.
That's what they used to call me at school.
I happened to be driving by. I thought I'd pop in for a cup of tea.
I've heard so much about you, Mr. Thwaite.
Johnnie told me about you, too. I ran into him at Newbury Races last week.
The races?
Put my foot in it as usual, have I? Didn't he tell you?
Johnnie has a job. He couldn't have been at the races.
Besides, he's given up betting.
He has, has he?
Don't you believe it, not Johnnie.
He's a great lad, he is.
You mustn't mind Johnnie cutting up. That's what makes him Johnnie.
Besides, he thinks you're a topper, he does. - I think so, too.
Won't you sit down?
I don't see why not.
Something wrong? Yes.
There were two chairs here this morning before I left.
Chairs?
Disappeared, have they?
Yes, apparently.
Were they expensive?
Yes, they were museum pieces.
That Johnnie, he'll be the death of me.
Don't you understand?
No, I don't.
I bet you 20-to-1 that Johnnie sold them.
Sold them? What for?
For money, of course. A fellow's got to pay his racing debts, hasn't he?
Johnnie dropped a packet of money at Newbury, I can tell you that.
These bookies don't trust a chap for long.
Not a chap like Johnnie, that is.
I don't believe you. I don't believe a word you're saying.
Put my foot in it again, have I?
My dear, you mustn't take it so seriously.
After all, it's Johnnie.
Wonderful chap, there's nobody like him. But I needn't tell you that.
He couldn't have sold them. He wouldn't, without asking me.
Here he comes. Don't tell him I've said a word.
If you want to see Johnnie at his very best... just say something about chairs.
He doesn't need more than one second... to invent the most howling lie you ever heard.
I wouldn't have missed this for anything in the world.
Beaky.
Johnnie, how are you?
What are you doing here?
I just popped in to see you.
I'm so glad to see you.
How's my little Monkeyface?
What's the matter, darling?
Nothing. Why?
You sure?
Your wife seems to be missing some chairs, old boy.
Your pipe's not lit. Let me get you a match.
Thanks, old bean.
Here you are, catch.
Thanks, old boy.
About those chairs, old bean?
The missing chairs, old man.
Yes, the chairs.
I imagine the American came to get them this morning.
What American?
Didn't I tell you about him, darling?
How stupid of me.
He dropped by about a week ago. A friend of Melbeck's.
I think you were out riding.
Go on, old man.
Anyway, he admired the chairs. Extravagant fellow.
Offered £100 apiece for them. Can you imagine? Anyone would take that.
I wouldn't.
Wouldn't you really, dear?
That never occurred to me.
As a matter of fact, I told him you would.
Why didn't you mention it?
I'm sorry, darling, but I thought I did.
That's all right. If they're gone, they're gone.
They're gone, all right.
Shall we change for dinner?
You are an angel.
Hold on a minute. You say he offered £100 apiece for them?
That's right.
Let's have a look at the check.
He'll send it along.
I bet you £10 to a shilling... you wouldn't dare let your wife pick up the telephone and ask Melbeck... if he ever saw this American.
Are you implying that my husband is a liar?
Don't mind Beaky, he's only joking.
I prefer jokes on other subjects.
Are you staying for dinner?
I'm spending the weekend unless you throw me out.
Johnnie's friends are always welcome, as long as they remain Johnnie's friends.
Hello, Isobel. Good afternoon.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Admiring your display? It's nice.
You are our only local celebrity.
Are you going my way?
Yes, I am.
How's Johnnie? - He's fine.
I just bought your latest for him.
He's an ardent admirer of yours.
I don't believe there's one of your stories he hasn't read.
What's the matter?
I just remembered something.
Will you excuse me? I want to make some inquiries.
Certainly.
I'll see you for dinner soon.
Delighted.
I'll phone you, then. Goodbye.
Hello, old girl.
Mr. Thwaite, I owe you an apology. Good.
I mean, what for?
I'll explain to you later, but I'm afraid I've done you an injustice.
An injustice?
Thanks very much.
I forgive you from the bottom of my heart.
You seem a bit hot under the collar. Not angry, are you? Don't answer.
Must be about old Johnnie.
Would you excuse me? I--
You mustn't be angry with Johnnie. It's a waste of time.
If you want to get sore with me, that's different altogether.
I annoy everybody, always did. But not Johnnie. You mustn't, really.
Would you mind, I want to speak to Johnnie alone. Could you--
You mean out in the garden?
Please.
Hello. Don't move. Just stay like that.
I must watch the expressions on your faces.
What've you got there, old bean?
You'll find out soon enough. This is a red-letter day. - Yes, sir?
What have we to drink in the house?
Gin, brandy, champagne and Pimm's NO.1.
Bring them all, and get a move on.
Very good, sir.
Stand aside.
Remember that necklace you admired in the shop window in Regent Street?
It's yours.
And here.... No, that's for Ethel.
Beaky, here's a little present for you.
What is it?
It's a secret.
Stick.
That's the finest that money can buy.
Thanks, old bean.
Hold those a moment, will you?
Darling, do you remember this?
I saw the hungry eye you gave it last time we were up in London. It's yours.
Thank you, Beaky.
Here are some hats for you.
Never did like your hats from the moment I ever saw you.
Like the funny hat you wore on the train.
I don't understand. - What made you do all this?
Now, dear, don't be angry.
If you don't like the hats, you can always return them.
I got a present for myself.
I say, old girl, this is a nice stick.
Strong.
Dog? - That's right.
All dogs are fond of me.
Go to Monkeyface.
But, Johnnie, you haven't told us what this is all about.
Yes, what's it mean?
I have the pleasure of announcing... the Goodwood Cup was run today and I backed the winner.
A 10-to-1 shot, and I had £200 on it.
£200 at 10-to-1, that's £2,000.
That's amazing. - What do you mean?
The way you worked that out so quickly.
What? - You know, the little sum.
You're pulling my leg, old bean.
Darling, what's happened to your tongue?
I suppose you disapprove of my betting.
Not with £2,000 in her lap.
Come on, smile. I know I've been naughty, but it's all for you. - See that?
That's Johnnie.
Go on, darling, smile.
Where did you get the £200?
That's not a very tactful question. - Where did you get it?
You know very well there was no American.
You sold the chairs to gamble all your money on a horse. Not exactly.
I owed the bookies some money.
It's an ancient story, but you know how bookies are.
I got the £200 to pay them off.
But then, along came this hot tip and....
Darling, come on, give us a smile.
Come on, old girl. I know.
You tickle her chin, and I'll make faces.
Think that will work?
Come on, smile.
Come on, dear.
Do you see the glimmer of a smile?
No, not a thing.
Know any other tricks? - Yeah.
I got something that never fails.
No, that's not doing it.
Shall I do this at the same time?
Yeah, try that.
Come on, dear.
I forgot something. Darling, look.
It's a receipt from a certain shop for a certain pair of chairs.
Paid in full, and they deliver within the hour.
Look, she's smiling.
I dare say she is.
My darling.
Well done, old bean.
I say, look. Ethel's done her stuff. What about celebrating?
You can always trust Beaky to say the right thing at the right time.
Come on, old bean.
I could do with a pull at the beaker.
Ethel, a present for you. Turn around.
Mr. Aysgarth.
It's much too good for me. You shouldn't have done that.
Thank you, sir.
Don't mention it.
What will my young man think?
Don't forget the box.
Yes, sir.
Don't forget my hat.
No, sir. Thank you, sir.
This is yours, old girl.
Thank you.
This is yours, old bean.
Thank you.
Now for a toast.
What have you got there, brandy?
Just this once.
You know that's not good for you.
All right, old man.
Maybe just this once.
All right, old bean.
I drink to the last bet that will ever made by Johnnie Aysgarth.
Last bet, old bean.
Get some water, quick. - It won't help.
I've seen it happen before. There's nothing much you can do about it.
That's no use, darling.
It will either kill him or it will go away by itself.
Sorry, old bean.
One of these days, it will kill him.
Hello, Mrs. Aysgarth.
How are you, Mrs. Newsham?
What a lot of books.
Do you really read them all, my dear?
I'm afraid not. They're for Johnnie.
Since when has he....
Detective stories.
Yes, he adores them.
So Johnnie's settled down to the simple rural life.
And it seems to agree with him.
Abandoned all his vices, has he?
Vices? What vices, Mrs. Newsham?
Such as betting at the races, for instance.
He has no time for that. He's much too busy with his job.
Is he?
Then he must have taken an afternoon off last Tuesday.
He was at the Merchester Races.
Was he? How interesting. Good afternoon.
Goodbye.
Good afternoon, Mrs. Aysgarth. - Good afternoon.
Is Mr. Aysgarth in?
Why, no.
When do you expect him?
I really couldn't say.
Perhaps you'd like to talk to Captain Melbeck.
Yes, I would very much, please.
Mrs. Aysgarth to see you.
Come in.
What a pleasure to see you.
Good afternoon.
Do sit down.
Thank you.
I don't want to impose upon you... but you're Johnnie's cousin as well as his employer.
I wanted to talk to you about him. I'm terribly worried.
Yes, I can understand that.
On the other hand, I told him I wouldn't prosecute.
Of course--
I don't understand.
I told him I wouldn't prosecute.
What on earth are you talking about?
How does he get away with it?
What reason did he give you when I discharged him?
When did you discharge him?
Six weeks ago.
I haven't a very keen sense of humor.
If this is a joke, I wish you would tell me.
It's not funny to me.
We had an unexpected audit six weeks ago.
The accounts showed a deficit of £2,000.
And when I looked into Johnnie's records....
I'm terribly sorry.
He should have told you.
It's perfectly all right.
And you say you aren't going to prosecute?
Not for the time being.
I'll give him every possible opportunity of replacing the money, but... after all....
Yes, of course. Thank you very much.
Goodbye.
Good afternoon, madam.
Mr. Aysgarth home yet?
No, madam.
Then you've heard.
Yes, I've heard.
I'm so sorry, darling. I'm terribly sorry.
This telegram just came from the doctor.
And to my dear sister, Emily Scudamore...
I bequeath an annuity of £1,000 for the duration of her lifetime.
To my niece, Miss Elsie Chilling, the sum of £5,000.
To my two dear cousins, Robert and Jane Atwood, £500 each.
The residue of my estate, my house, and all the property contained therein...
I leave to my beloved wife, Martha... with the wish that she continue the present allowance of £500 a year... to my daughter, Lina.
Also, to my daughter Lina and her husband John Aysgarth...
I bequeath the portrait of myself... painted by the distinguished Sir Joshua Nettlewood.
I could do with a drink.
I'll get you one.
Don't bother, I'll get it myself. In the study, isn't it?
You win, old boy.
Yes, dear?
Do you ever have any regrets that you married me?
Why do you ask that?
It seems pretty obvious... that your father would've left you more than his portrait... if you'd been anybody else but Mrs. John Aysgarth.
So that's what you meant.
You haven't answered my question.
What about you? Have you any regrets?
Monkeyface, marrying you is the one thing I've never changed my mind about.
Do you really mean that?
Yes, I really mean that.
I want nothing but to spend the rest of my life with you.
And if you were to die first, I....
If I were to die first?
Listen, what about you?
I couldn't stop loving you if I tried.
Have you tried?
Yes. Once.
When?
When I found out you'd lost your job with Captain Melbeck.
How long have you known?
Since last Friday.
Who told you?
Captain Melbeck. I met him.
Did he tell you why?
No.
Suppose you tell me why.
We just didn't get along.
Quite nice here. Shall we stop and look at the sea?
Why didn't you get along with him?
I don't know. He's a bit of an old fogy.
I suppose my ideas were too daring for him.
I've always had the notion that the secret of success is to start at the top.
You think I'm talking through my hat, don't you? I'm not.
The way to make money is to think in a big way.
Look at this all land, for instance.
Look at the view. Why isn't something done about it?
If I had £10,000, or better still, £20,000...
I could start a development here.
All you need is £20,000?
Or £30,000.
An extra £10,000 wouldn't hurt a bit.
Beaky, this is the ground plan. Wonderful.
We could put the large hotel there.
That's the idea. And down here, we could build the beach huts.
Beechnuts, old bean?
Huts, Beaky. - Hello.
What goes on here, anyway?
We're organizing a real estate company.
We're about to buy a very beautiful piece of land by the sea.
What a view, what sun, what air.
Then we're going to sell part of it at a profit.
Yes, but it will need financing, won't it?
Of course.
You found somebody to put up the money?
Of course.
Who? - Me.
I see.
The idea is mine, but the money is Beaky's.
And the corporation, Beaky borrows against those securities he has in Paris.
Then we issue stock, and....
Let me show you, dear.
The company's going to be in my name.
Yes, but....
Look, darling... let me show you how simple it is.
Does Beaky understand it?
Perfectly.
I think.
I beg your pardon, sir. Captain Melbeck would like to talk to you on the telephone.
Thank you. I'll take it in the study.
Excuse me, Beaky.
All right, old bean.
Please explain it to me, will you?
You see, my dear girl....
I say, I rather like this feeling of big business and all that sort of thing.
George, I keep telling you not to worry about it.
I've got something on now. I can pay you back in a couple of weeks.
We buy up this land and then we sell part of it.
That gives us a 100% profit in no time.
On the other part, we build something or other.
But from whom do you buy the land? How much do you pay for it?
To whom do you sell it?
That shouldn't be difficult.
Isn't it about time you grew up?
You're scolding me. - You need a scolding.
Do I?
Yes, you do.
Shall I go and stand in the corner?
You're not being fair to Johnnie.
That's a bit thick.
Why, he's president of the whole bally thingamajig. - Gets a salary, writes his own checks.
Yes, that's what I mean.
What's wrong with that?
Old bean, Lina's been telling me you're a bit soft in the head. Is that it?
It sounded like that.
Come now, that's not very wifely.
Hadn't you better change for dinner? It's getting late.
Darling, Beaky's staying with us for a few days.
You know your room.
I shan't be a jiffy.
Look here. What right have you to interfere in my affairs?
I wasn't really. I was only....
You were only what?
I was only trying to tell Beaky that he shouldn't leave everything to you... because if something went wrong, he should take a little responsibility, too.
It's not as if you're both experienced businessmen.
What do you know about business?
Very little. I was only--
Suppose Beaky had taken you seriously?
You'd have ruined the whole scheme, you realize that?
But if it weren't any good....
That's my business, not yours.
If I say it's good, it's good.
I'm going through with this deal.
I don't want any interference from you or anyone else.
Is that clear?
Yes, that's clear.
Hello, Monkeyface.
You frightened me. I didn't see you coming.
I thought you might like to know I'm calling off the real estate plan. Why?
What happened?
Nothing. - Does Beaky know about this?
No, not yet.
Why are you doing it?
I don't know.
Perhaps the land isn't any good. Who knows?
Or perhaps I don't like the idea of risking Beaky's money.
Or perhaps it's a stiff job and I'm too lazy.
Are you still angry about last night?
No, I'm not angry.
Are you sure?
Because I couldn't sleep all night.
You'd never spoken so sharply to me before, and I was afraid....
Afraid of what?
I was afraid you'd stopped loving me.
No, Monkeyface, I'm not angry.
And I love you very much.
Every time I play anagrams, I can only make three-letter words. D-O-U-B.
There's no such word.
D-O-U-B-T. "Doubt." F-U-L. "Doubtful."
Take that, old girl.
Personally, I don't see what's wrong with this scheme.
But if you say there's no good going ahead, don't let's go ahead.
Do I get another turn?
I still don't understand why we have to go all the way out there to look at it.
I won't be responsible for calling the scheme off...
without first proving to you it's no good.
If you say it's no good, that satisfies me.
After all, you discovered the land. It was your idea.
If a fellow has an idea, he jolly well ought to follow it up.
You have to go up there early tomorrow morning and take a look.
Why are you so insistent?
Because, as I told you, I won't be responsible.
That's a long one. "Mudder." There's no such word.
Try the "R."
I don't want to go up there in the morning. Besides, it'll be nasty, and cold, and wet. - Now, Beaky.
What time do we have to start?
If I had an "e" and an "r" I could make that murderer.
The earlier the better.
I'd say about 7:00. There won't be so much traffic then. - 7:00?
That's a bit pig's tail.
Pig's tail?
Too early. Did you never hear that one, pig's tail?
Is Mr. Aysgarth having breakfast?
No, ma'am, he wouldn't wait. He said he'd have some on the road.
He left two hours ago with Mr. Thwaite.
What car did they use?
Mr. Thwaite's, I believe.
This ought to do it.
How's that, old bean?
Hello, old girl.
Hello, darling.
What's all this?
I've only been away a few hours.
It seemed like a thousand years.
Seems like that to me, too. Shut up, Beaky.
It was nothing. Nothing?
I came very close to losing my life. You call that nothing?
You nearly lost your life?
Came very close to it.
Let's drop the subject.
No, Beaky, go on. I want to hear.
There we were at the top of the cliff.
I agreed that Johnnie was right.
There was too much chalk in the soil.
I was trying to turn my car near the edge of the cliff. I never was handy with a car.
Was Johnnie in the car? - No.
He was a few feet away looking over at the view.
It's hardly worth talking about. Let's all have a drink.
I didn't realize I was backing the car towards the edge.
But I was, by Jove. Right up to it.
If Johnnie hadn't taken a flying leap and grabbed the brake...
I should be in kingdom come by now.
Johnnie saved your life?
He certainly did.
Came jolly close to losing his own, too.
I can never tell you how much this means to me.
To you, darling?
It means a good bit to me, too.
The old fellow deserves a reward.
How about a night out?
A spot of celebrating on me.
That's kind of you, but don't you have to go to Paris? - Paris?
Yes.
My securities are over there.
I've got to go over there and cancel all the arrangements for them.
Why don't you come over with me?
The cad seems to forget I'm a married man.
I'll tell you what I might do. I might drive up as far as London with you for that evening out.
How about that, Monkeyface?
Yes, Monkey.... Lina. Do let him come.
It seems to me that-- Yes, I know.
It seems to you I should be looking for a job.
It seems to me I'd have much more chance of getting a job in London.
Yes, of course he would. Do let him come, Lina.
I don't see very well how I can stop him.
Great.
Pity that he won't come to Paris with me.
Did I ever tell you what happened to me last time I was in Paris?
I was walking down the Champs Élysées... and I met the most charming girl. A very curious instance.
Took her out and gave her a spot of dinner. And it wasn't till much later....
Sorry, old bean. Sorry, old girl.
Nearly put the foot in it again, have I?
There's an Inspector Hodgson in the hall, ma'am.
He wanted to see Mr. Aysgarth.
But when I said he was away, he asked if he might speak to you.
Show him to the study, will you, Ethel, please.
Very good, madam.
Will you come this way, please, sir?
Thank you.
Mrs. Aysgarth?
Yes. My name's Hodgson.
Inspector Hodgson. We're from the county police.
This is my colleague. Mr. Benson.
How do you do, Mr. Benson?
How do you do?
Won't you sit down?
Thank you, ma'am.
I understand your husband's not in. No.
He's been up in London for two days.
As he's not here, I thought you might be able to help us. Yes, of course.
Won't you have some tea or something?
No, thank you. We've had ours.
I believe you know a Mr. Thwaite.
Yes, he's a close friend of my husband.
I don't know how to put it, quite.
Perhaps it would be easier if I showed you this.
This afternoon's paper.
Excuse me.
I'm sorry. This is a shock.
We knew him so very well.
Sorry to have to do this, ma'am... but we're making inquiries on behalf of the Paris police.
They found papers on Mr. Thwaite's person... which indicated he'd just formed a corporation with your husband.
What do the French police believe caused the death?
This is the copy of a telegram we received from Paris.
Thwaite visited the place in the company of another Englishman.
Both men had evidently been drinking.
On arrival, Thwaite ordered a bottle of brandy.
According to the statement of one of the waiters there...
Thwaite's companion asked for the brandy to be served in large beakers.
Apparently, as a result of a bet between the two men...
Thwaite filled one of these beakers to the brim and drank it all.
The other man was not present when the actual tragedy happened...
having left the place a few minutes before.
French police have not yet succeeded in establishing his identity.
According to the waiter, who has a slight understanding of English...
his name would appear to be 'Awlbeam' or 'Holebeam.'"
I'm sorry to upset you, ma'am.
But do you or your husband know of any friend of Mr. Thwaite's... who would answer to such a name?
Perhaps Mrs. Aysgarth could enlighten us about this corporation.
Yes, I believe I can.
My husband had planned a real estate development with him.
Mr. Thwaite had gone to Paris to dissolve the corporation.
He apparently died before he could do this.
Thank you, ma'am. Any further questions, Benson?
None that I can think of.
Thank you very much, Mrs. Aysgarth.
Thank you.
I'm sorry.
When does Mr. Aysgarth return from London?
I expect him this evening.
Would you ask him to ring me at the station? Yes, of course.
Goodbye, Inspector Hodgson.
Goodbye. - Benson.
Goodbye, Mrs. Aysgarth.
He didn't go to Paris.
He didn't go to Paris, I tell you.
Hogarth Club.
May I speak to Mr. Aysgarth, please?
When do you expect him?
He left yesterday morning?
It doesn't matter. Thank you.
Hello, Monkeyface.
You've read about Beaky, have you?
I was terribly fond of Beaky.
Were you?
Yes, dear.
I loved that silly, generous, good-hearted fool.
Did you?
Of course I did.
Next to you, I loved him more than anybody in the world.
Next to me?
Poor Monkeyface.
Here I am thinking only of myself and forgetting all about you.
You liked him, too, didn't you?
I liked him very much.
The police were here.
What did they want?
They wanted you to help them.
They had a telegram from Paris... and it seems there was an Englishman who made a bet-- Yes, I know.
The whole story was in the late edition.
What else?
The inspector wants you to phone him.
He thought perhaps you could help identify this Englishman.
What did you tell them?
Did you mention the corporation?
Naturally.
I told them that Beaky was planning to dissolve it.
I wish you'd left all that to me.
What else did you tell them?
That's about all.
I said I was expecting you back from London at any moment.
Wickstead police station, please.
Hello, Inspector.
This is John Aysgarth. I've just got home.
Yes.
I drove up to London with him on Tuesday evening.
We dined at the Savoy. No.
Yes.
Then I saw him off at Croyden Airport.
Yes.
I stayed in London until this afternoon.
At my club.
Yes.
Yes.
Not at all, Inspector. If I can help you in any other way, be sure to let me know.
Isobel, may I come in? Lina, how nice.
I was thinking only yesterday... that I don't see half as much of you as I'd like.
How sweet of you.
I couldn't put my light out until 3:00 this morning. I was so interested in your last book that I had to come over and talk to you about it.
That's the most thrilling compliment I ever got.
Had your tea? - Yes, I have.
Thank you.
I never knew you were such a murder story fan.
Neither did I until recently.
Did you really like it?
I couldn't put it down.
I was completely fascinated by the way your villain-- My villain?
My hero, you mean.
I always think of my murderers as my heroes.
I didn't mean to interrupt. You were saying you were completely fascinated.
When he enticed his victim across the footbridge... knowing that the bridge had been sawn through--
He also knew that his victim couldn't swim. Don't forget that.
What I want to know is this. Would you call that an actual murder?
From a moral standpoint, there's no question at all. It is murder.
I suppose it is.
What does Johnnie think? Johnnie?
I haven't discussed it with him yet.
I should think he'd be interested.
The same situation with this friend of his in Paris.
The same?
That brandy business is just like my footbridge.
If they get his companion, the question would be:
Was it murder or an accident?
The brandy thing isn't new at all, you know.
It's been done before?
Yes, and in real life, too.
I have it here.
Richard Palmer got rid of one of his victims that way. A man called Abbey.
Was he hanged?
Trial of Richard Palmer. Where can it be?
They got him eventually, after he killed half a dozen other people.
The fool got bored with the brandy method and went on with real poison.
He was a fool, wasn't he?
Maybe I put it under the "T's."
If he'd stuck to brandy, he might have....
That's an interesting idea.
Suppose I ask my brother about it.
He's the Home Office Analyst. Conducts post-mortems and all that sort of things.
I get some of my neatest ideas from him.
It really doesn't matter, Isobel. Please don't bother. It's not important.
I'll run along. I don't want to trouble you.
Now I remember.
It's in your own house. - What is?
The Trial of Richard Palmer.
That book about the brandy.
Johnnie borrowed it a couple of weeks ago.
Goodbye, Isobel.
Goodbye, my dear.
Hello?
No, he isn't in. This is Mrs. Aysgarth speaking.
This is the Guarantors Assurance Company.
Would you tell Mr. Aysgarth that there's been a delay in replying to his inquiry?
We have written him fully on the matter. He should get our letter in the morning. Yes, I will.
Thank you.
Good morning, madam.
Good morning.
Are there any letters?
Just three for Mr. Aysgarth and a magazine for you, ma'am.
Hello, Ethel. You here again? Yes, sir.
I've brought your morning tea and the post.
Hello, darling. Any letters for me? - Three.
Thank you, dear.
Well, well, well.
Good news?
Got a letter from old Spotty. He's going to India.
What a life.
Says he wishes he had time to pop down and see us.
That'd be a dream. Poor old Spotty.
Do you mind if I take my bath before you?
No, dear.
May I have some more soap, Monkeyface?
This bit's nearly gone.
Yes, there's some in the cupboard above the washbasin.
Darling, you're not shivering, are you?
I've a bit of a chill.
Cold in all this sunshine?
Let me warm you up.
My poor little shivering baby.
How do you feel now? Better? - Much.
Good.
Perhaps this will help.
Darling, what are we doing tonight?
We're going to Isobel's to dine.
What a bore.
Issie, let's get back to that new book of yours.
The fellow comes into the room, locks it, and starts to strum on the piano... then somebody shoots him through the locked door?
That doesn't make sense.
Why would he lock the door just to play the piano?
Was he ashamed of his playing?
I arranged it this way.
A certain note on the piano was wired to a revolver concealed in the wall paneling.
When the victim struck this note.... There you are.
I don't care much for that. You're slipping, old girl.
What's wrong with it, my dear chap?
That's too complicated.
If you're going to kill somebody, do it simply.
Am I right, Dr. Sedbusk? You're right.
Just as long as you don't get caught.
Do the wine, will you?
Yes, Issie.
How would you do it simply?
I don't know, dear. I'd use the most obvious method.
The most important thing is that no one should suspect me.
For instance?
For instance, poison.
Just use the first one that came to my mind.
Say, arsenic.
Arsenic.
I remember... in Gloucester, where we exhumed the body four years after... there was still enough poison, even in the fingernails and the hair.
Yes, but did you get the murderer?
Let me see.
No, I don't think we did.
There you are. Think of it.
This very minute, there are hundreds of people... who have committed murder and they're walking about freely.
Thousands.
Do you suppose those murderers are happy, Johnnie? I don't know, dear.
I don't see why they shouldn't be.
Fear of discovery, my lad.
So long as arsenic leaves traces and a bullet's marked by the barrel of a gun... and the tiniest hair of your head can be identified....
It seems to me by now someone would've discovered a poison that can't be traced.
What about it, Doctor?
A very interesting corpse dropped in the other day.
Do let's hear about it.
No, please. Don't change the subject.
I saw that look that passed between you.
There's an untraceable poison, isn't there? Nonsense.
No such thing.
I'll bet you know, Doctor. What is it?
Not in a million years.
Now, come. After all, do I look like a murderer?
That's an interesting question. What do you think, Issie?
Issie can tell by looking at a person's face whether he or she is capable of murder. Can't you, Issie?
I don't want to sound conceited, but I usually can.
What about me, dear? Could I murder anyone?
You couldn't hurt a fly, Bertram. Unless it was already dead.
What about Mrs. Aysgarth? She has a strange glint in her eye. I'm afraid not.
Lina hasn't the nerve any more than I have.
As for you, you silly thing.
Look at the expression on his face. Trying to look mysterious, are you? You can't fool me.
You couldn't commit a murder if you tried for 100 years.
No, I don't believe I could.
Johnnie, you're locking up. What about Ethel?
It's Ethel's day off. She won't be back until morning.
What about Cook? What's the matter, dear?
Have you forgotten?
Cook's away on a holiday.
Darling, you're shivering again. Do you suppose you're catching cold? Yes.
I think that's what it must be.
We have to tuck you into bed. Get you nice and warm. - Take off your coat.
No, Johnnie.
Please don't.
This reminds me of the day we first met on the top of the hill... when you wouldn't let me unbutton the top button of your blouse.
Do you remember?
I shall never forget it.
Get undressed, old girl. What are you waiting for?
Johnnie, I'm in a state tonight. I don't know why. I'd like to be alone.
Would you mind sleeping in your dressing room?
Of course I'd mind.
Please, Johnnie. I haven't been sleeping very well lately.
I understand.
You used to sleep badly when I wasn't here, and now you....
All right, if that's how you feel about it.
Good night.
Feeling better?
Yes, thank you.
Hello, Isobel.
How are you, my dear?
All right.
I've been asleep all day, haven't I?
Isobel's brother gave you a sleeping pill this morning.
Your nerves seemed to be all upset.
We were quite worried about you. Cheer up.
Bertram had a good look at you.
Although he doesn't usually attend living people, he's a very able doctor.
He says all you needed was a little sleep.
I'll run down and tell Ethel to fix something for your supper.
He's one in a million, that Johnnie of yours. Isn't he?
Do you mind if I smoke?
Have you been here all afternoon? Naturally.
Ever since Johnnie phoned. I warn you.
You'd better get well.
If you leave me alone much longer with this husband of yours... my career will soon be over.
He flirted with you, I suppose.
Flirted? Worse than that.
He's worming all my secrets out of me.
I suspect him of writing a detective story on the side.
What secrets?
He's always pestering me.
I always swear I won't tell him and I always do.
Did you tell him anything today? Did I?
Bertram was furious. Said he'd never confide in me again.
But honestly, have you ever been able to deny Johnnie anything?
Never.
It was about that poison, wasn't it? Don't remind me of it.
I'm ashamed, and mortified, and disgraced.
I'm just a fool, that's all.
If he writes a story on that one before I do... I suppose I'll deserve it. Imagine.
A substance in daily use everywhere. Anyone can lay his hands on it.
And within a minute after taking, the victim's beautifully out of the way.
Mind you, it's undetectable after death.
Is whatever it is painful?
Not in the least.
In fact, I should think it would be a most pleasant death.
Good night, Lina.
You're still annoyed with me, aren't you?
No, Johnnie, really. I still don't feel well.
A few days at your mother's house will do more good than staying at home. It's not exactly that.
Don't you understand? Mother telephoned me and--
She got on that telephone awfully early, it seems to me.
Mother gets up early, and she's lonely down there.
I happened to mention I was a bit nervy... and before I knew it I'd agreed to spend a few days with her.
I'll run down and get the car ready. - No.
I'll drive myself.
I prefer to drive you.
I think I'll take the short cut.
Johnnie!
Johnnie!
Lina, what's got into you? Lina!
Stop it, you little fool! I've had enough!
How much do you think a man can bear? Listen to me!
You throw me out of your room, run off to your mother's... now you shrink away from me as though you hated me.
You almost killed us both back there.
You pulled away when I was reaching over to save you from falling out of the car.
You don't have to put up with me anymore.
Johnnie, where are you going?
First, I'm taking you to your mother's.
And then what?
Don't worry. I won't bother you again.
Johnnie, you mean you're going to....
Why were you asking Isobel those questions about the poison?
What were you planning to do with it?
Johnnie, you were going to kill yourself.
My darling.
Yes, but I saw that was a cheap way out.
I'm going to see it through, prison term and everything. Prison?
You mean Melbeck, that money you took?
I can't pay it back.
I made the last attempt to raise the money when I went away with Beaky.
I went to Liverpool.
I tried to borrow on your insurance, but it didn't work.
You were in Liverpool when Beaky....
Then you didn't go to Paris.
Of course not.
You think I'd have let some idiot give poor old Beaky that brandy if I had?
Johnnie, if I'd only known. This is as much my fault as yours.
I was only thinking of myself, not what you were going through.
If I'd been really close to you, you could've confided in me... but you were afraid to.
You were ashamed to come to me.
If I'd only understood.
But it will be different now.
We'll make it different.
People don't change overnight, Lina.
I'm no good.
Let's turn back. Let's go home and see it all through together. No.
It won't work. I'm driving you on to your mother's. It will work.
I know it will, Johnnie, please.
This isn't your problem, Lina. But it is.
You can't shut me out.
Turn the car around and let's go home. Please, Johnnie.
No, Lina.
My darling.
1871 then?
No, Father was born in 1872.
How much older than Mom?
Eight years.
Then he is 69.
So, Mom was born in...?
The year of Dragon.
Eight years since we last gathered. For Father's 61st Birthday.
You were small then.
You wore a sy-blue hair ribbon.
You still remember it? You looed nice wearing it.
I wished I'd been old enough to wear one.
You're old enough to get married now.
And Mom's 61 now.
Right.
I never thought you would marry my brother.
I didn't now you had a brother, either.
Did you want to?
May be no.
Hello!
Hello, nice to meet you!
Ryoichi?
He is here.
I stopped off on the way.
How are you?
Good, than you.
I lie your sash.
A gift from my husband's co-worer.
Yours?
From mom, she wore it when she was 22 or 23.
She wore such subdued sashes when young?
The photographer is here?

He often fails, Dad does not trust him.
So, we don't consider him
Everyone is here?
Yes, you are the last.

Nowhere to go?
What happened then?
I made a mistae.
That was the right answer, my sister is 3 years younger than me.
I wrote:
My sister is 3 years old and younger than me.
You did? That was wrong.
Grandpa, will the teacher pass me?
I doubt it.
Grandma?
I wonder.
Hello.
Hello.
It has been a long time, father.
Yes.
You loo well.
Thans.
Happy birthday Mum!
Thans, than you for your gift.

Sorry to be late, I went to see Toio
Did you come straight home?
Mother and I had some tea.
We waled to Hibiya Par.
The flowers were lovely.
We heard music at the hall.
How nice, you two alone, after such a long time.
Yes, When was it we went to view flowers together.
Two years after the Great Earthwuae.
The 1923 wuae?
Years ago. More than ten years ago.
So many years?
I was happy today. My entire family came. I am glad I live long.
The food was delicious, wasn't it?
What food?
With white sauce.
You ased for more.
That sure was good.
Want something to eat?
Shall I have an apple pie?
Please do, change first.
Excuse me!

Will he be all right?
He is already 69.
A Chinese philosopher said a man understands life at fifty, and enjoys life at seventy.
It's so upsetting.
It came so suddenly.

Lie down for awhile.

Yes, it will be published tomorrow.

I have not yet seen him.
Right.
I sat so long my legs hurt.
Grandma's nose was red.
Right.
We will play later.
I am bac.
Where were you?
In Osaa.
Carefree man!
I never thought this would happen.
You should tell me where you have gone.
We looed for you.
I'm very sorry.
I wanted to fish suddenly.
You can't go fishing at that time.
I don't.
The sea was tough.
I wuit and come home.
Did he leave his last words.
No!
Didn't he complain about me?
May be he was in too much pain to do so.
I see.
What's this?
Tea leaves to eep me awae.
Please give me some.
You have lost some weight.
Go to sleep.
I am fine.
Really?
Are you oay?
I slept during the day.
Where is mother?
We made her go to bed.
Good.
It would be trouble if she gets sic too.
Go to sleep, let's tae turns to sleep.
Is there any food?
Mae rice ball for me.
Big one.
Tomorrow is another day.
I am bac, mother.
You are bac?
Sorry!
I didn't expect too.
I was the source of his worries.
Yet I wasn't here when he died.
After all, I haven't given him anything.
I might have, if he lived longer.
I regret now.
Sorry.
Among these things, the firm Dad had been close to went banrupt.
He'd drawn notes for huge sums for it.
We were surprised. He didn't draw them recently.
He had been postponing their due date.
We are morally responsible for their payment.
We can't pay the entire amount.
But we must pay at least half.
He was very powerful in the economic world.
But his fame caused this disaster.
Dad was a man with a pure heart and clean hands.
He always was. Now, we must be satisfied.
I spoe to Suzui too.
We will sell everything, this house, land...
To pay his note.
I am sorry to mae you come for this bad news.
What do you thin about it?
No matter how, we have no choice.
How is sister?
We have no choice.
Your comment?
We have no choice.
Shojiro.
I agree.
What about mother and Setsuo?
They can move here.
Can't they stay till Setsuo gets married.
The sooner the better, right.
That house?
It's really old, only the land worth money.
And you?
Don't worry about me. Enough?
Do you thin I can manage?
Yes, if we do it properly.
Here's a list of these paintings and curios.
Some of them are wuite valuable.
No 36, Flowers and birds in Autumn.
Shen-Nan-Pin.
Yes, by Shen-Nan-Pin.
No 37, Waterfall Viewing.
Who?
An ancient Chinese poet.
No 38, Mt Muji. Hoitsu Saai.
No 4=, Snow Over Pines.
No 43, Plate with Narcissus Motifs.
A phone call for Mr Shojiro.
Excuse me.
862 items, some juns are included.
Any tea ceremony bowls?
I want one.
Hello?
Fine, I am coming.
I will be right there.
I feel really sorry.
He was a good customer.
Too sudden.
How old was he?
He was not too old.
But he was not young anymore.
It's sae's fault.
Don't drin too much.
I won't.
Drin some.
No thans, enjoy yourself.
More sae.
You were not there?
When?
When your dad passed away?
I was.
Liar. You were fishing at Osaa.
Got some?
Nonsense!
We all now. Do you thin it is too sudden?
Of course.
He was a good father.
He was scary too.
I don't thin so.
Sure, and he died so abruptly.
He pitched the first ball at a baseball game.
His ball bounced twice on the ground.
I was surprised.
He'd practiced how to pitch.
He was not good at sports.
But he was a good archer.
Yes, he practiced everyday.
I got up early to help him.
He would be in a good mood at such times.
You sold his boos, right?
The one you brought here.
Yes!
I called a secondhand boostore.
It can sell a good price.
Where did the money go?
We spent it on drining.
You stole his telescope too, didn't you?
The long one.
Enough!
That wristwatch.
Stop it, enough!
He has already passed away.
He didn't now...
I doubt.
He new it but he did not tell you.
It was useless to tell me.
I don't agree.
He was a good father.
Yes.
Father is such a nice man.
I hope he can live longer.
Tae care of yourself.
If you're dead, you cannot drin anymore.
Can I live until 7=?
You can.
Why?
They say, "Bad boys live long ".
Then I will be a bad boy.
You're already bad.
Am I?
Why?
What are you doing?
I am fine
Strange, right?
I wasn't sad when he died.
But now I remember those trivial things.
Father and I ate here.
In this room. He sat here, I there.
At this hour, too. The sunlight lie this.
This sae cup too.
There was a fly. It landed on his ear.
He shooed it away, but it soon came bac.
Men cry at odd times.
Come to thin of it, bad sons cry easily, right.
I'll go there.
Where?
Tianjin in China.
I would lie to get a job there.
Are you sure?
I have been thining for so long, I want to find a job.
I don't have a house.
Any wor will do.
I just want to wor.
I want to start over.
Not because father died, it's been my wish.
Decided?
Almost.
When will you go?
As soon as it's decided.
So, you will go?
We are going to lose you.
A good man.
Eat what you can't eat there.
Let's order more sae.
Good idea.
This is very valuable.
It sure is.
What do you thin?
Is No 627 here?
No 627.
Here it is, it's in a box.
Show me.
Here it is.
This is the one.
It's very good.
I must pac. Please see to this.
Alright.
Excuse me.
Enough?
Thans.
Finished?
Why not tae this coat too?
No thans.
It's cold there.
I don't thin it's that cold.
That is new.
Really? If you insist.
Thans.
How about your ticet?
I have bought it.
The other day I went to Osaa.
I will pass there and go as far as Tianjin.
Life's unpredictable.
Tae care!
Weather is unsteady there.
Don't worry.
Drin only boiled water.
He is not a child anymore, mother.
Tae good care of yourself.
You tae care of yourself, too.
We will not meet for a while.
When can we meet next?
Maybe we will get together only after I die.
Nonsense, never tal lie that.
You will live long and see more happy times.
You thin so?
Of course you will. Right?
You must.
Tianjin is not so far. Tae a plane.
The trip is much shorter than a domestic train ride.
Really?
Sure, don't worry.
Tae a bath.
Please go.
Don't forget anything.
Setsuo, please help him.
Give me that.
You'd better forget that marriage proposal.
I am sorry for you. Please give up.
He cancelled it just because Dad died.
I am glad he did.
I don't want you to marry such a heartless man.
Forget it.
Mum is very worried.
I will find a better man for you.
One who has a good build and is ind.
But he's not very handsome.
A guy lie me.
Right, eep this smile.
Don't worry.
I will write to you from China, you too.
Tell me everything.
After you move in with Soichiro you will have lots of inconveniences.
You have to be patient.
I will wor hard this time.
I really will, you try hard too.
Tae good care of mother.
I thin she will not get used to this.
You are crying again.
I can't leave with this.
Tae good care of mum.
Sure, don't worry.
Will they really come?
Yes, there is no better method to care for them.
Where will mother and Setsuo stay?
Upstair.
How about me?
Downstairs.
Where is my luggage?
Leave it upstairs.
No.
Then, bring them downstairs.
Chizuo's house is bigger.
Maybe.
I am the eldest son. It may be inconvenient, but please put up with it.
Not just me, they may find it crowded too.
Setsuo has brought many things.
And the maid.
They will bring that hill myna bird.
Pull that part.
What did sister say?
Has she complained?
I have made a big mistae.
The flowers are too beautiful I piced one.
You shouldn't!
Kazuo loves them so much.
I didn't now it then.
They are special species.
They are so lovely. I was ignorant.
That part.
The madam wants you.
Mother, here is the needle.
Going out?
Yes, you now Tanimoto, don't you?
She is in town now.
I invited her here this evening.
Will you go out with mother?
Staying here, she will only be annoyed.
Stay out till 7 or 8. How about it?
I am sorry to mae you do it.
You will go to Ginza, right?
Will you do me a favour? Have some cae and fruit delivered.
What type?
I will bring some.
And sandwiches.
Sandwiches?
Shall I mae them myself?
Don't bother Order them, for 6 people.
Sorry to bother you!
It's alright.
Don't give any to Mitsuo, all right?
Never do that.
Tell mother not to, either.
Sweets give her the trots.
I will go, see you later.
Clean the place and water the flowers.
Will you tae the bird upstairs.
I don't want it to bother us.
I will do it.
Where shall we go?
Let me thin.
Where?
Hibiya Par.
How about Ueno Zoo?
You go alone, enjoy yourself.
Don't worry about me!
I thin I will go to see Chizuo.
I haven't seen her for a while.
You go to Ginza.
Then we will go separately.
Have a good time.
I will go to see Toio.
Good idea, be careful on the way.
You too!
Shall I give you some?
Yes, please.
Sister didn't give me money.
Than you!
Tae care!
Hello!
Welcome.
Such a long time.
Where is Madame?
She went out for a tea ceremony lesson.
Oh!
She has a lesson every day.
Oh, I remember.
Shall I phone her?
No, everyone's fine?
Grandma.
Hello.
Hello, you are alone.
No need to go to school?
No, come to my room.
I have something to show you.
Let's go.
You have grown, haven't you?
The tallest in your class?
Tae a loo.
Can you see?
Nice, huh?
Something messy.
Guess what?
Tell me.
How should I now that?
It's simple. My snot.
Loos great, huh?
Want to see more?
No thans.
What happened at your school?
It's great!
Why stay home?
I am playing hooey, don't tell mom.
Why?
I had a fight yesterday.
What happened?
They fooled me.
They will get bac at me.
It that the only reason? You should go to school.
Who's there?
Get out.
Here, have some tea.
Shut the door.
Ryoichi...
Don't sip school just lie that.
Will you tell mom?
You'll do it again?
Will you tell her?
Let us mae a deal.
Don't do this again.
Apologize to your teachers later, alright?
You sure?
Don't tell mom, oay?
Don't worry, I promise you
I am going to have my lunch.
I will give you half.
Tae this. I will eat first.
Be careful.
How to use the microscope?
Again?
Don't.
You eat first, I will eat that.
Can you stay longer?
Let's play together.
Mom will be home late.
I am going to visit your grandpa's grave.
I go with you.
Really?
He must be happy.
He loves you.
Let's go together wuicly.
Hurry.
Who maes your lunch every morning?
The maid.
Delicious?
Good!
Have some tea.
How are you?
Sorry to mae you come.
Busy?
It's oay, how is your mother?
Fine, thans.
It's been a long time.
Mother sends her regards.
What do you do every day?
Me? Various things.
Housewor, I clean the house and coo.
I mended the wuilts today.
You do that, too?
Yes. I am wuite busy.
Loo! I too a day off today.
You do such things? Poor girl.
Why?
Well... I can't stay the innocent girl forever.
Impressed?
Yes, very much.
Really?
Is your wor hard?
Can I do it, too?
Of course.
Then let me do it.
Why?
I feel lie it, that's all.
I wonder if I can do it.
Don't laugh, I am serious.
How are you recently?
How is your mom?
Are they hitting it off?
Can you tell?
Are they?
No.
I thought so. I am sorry to tal this way.
No one is to blame.
It's just... they are too different in many ways.
I now.
What should I do at such times?
I eep feeling sorry for both of them.
And you?
I am fine.
So I will wor and live with Mother.
I now, but you should thin deeply.
You and I are very different.
My father's a mere employee, while... yours was an employer.
You and I...
Born under different environment.
Do you thin you can live lie me?
Is it wrong?
I am asing if you have got the courage.
Great courage.
I have courage.
You sure?
Don't you thin it will only worry your mother.
She will understand, but...
You'd better consider it well.
Will.
Sorry, I tal too much.
I feel sorry for your mother. Shall we eat?
I will pay.
Let me treat you. I have money.
Mother gave me some on the street, I was ashamed.
Ashamed? Just for that?
We're different there. Understand?
What'll it be?
Something cheap that tastes good.
And big, right? That's it.
How about this?
Which one, then?
It's all right, isn't it?
No. Toyo is the best.
Really? I lie it there.
We can see mountains, and the sea.
Misuo?
She went to bed.
Food is better there, too.
Did she go to bed?
Yes.
Bright girl.
The food there is better.
Some Toyo restaurants serve similar food.
But it's not so good.
Welcome bac.
I am bac
The guests still here?
Has mother come home?
Where is she?
At the itchen.
I am bac
I am late, when did you get bac?
Two hours ago.
I thought the guests had gone.
I too a wal with Toio.
She sends her regards.
That's nice of her.
What about you?
Chizuo was out.
Ryoichi and I visited Father's grave
He carried flowers.
Then he said, "Don't die, grandma ".
He is nice.
Tae a shower.
How about you?
After Kazuo does.
Why not bathe first?
I will do it later.
You are sleepy, aren't you?
Are they leaving?
It is so late.
Kazuo is in a good mood.
I can tell by how she calls the maid.
The maid thins so.
They are leaving?
No, they want some tea.
The water's boiling?
These cups?
She called you.
How's sister?
Fine?
Leaving so soon?
Why not stay longer?
Will you be in town long?
Yes, we will meet again.
The tea...
Right away.
Forget it. Call the taxi.
Never mind.
Call the taxi.
No thans.
No need now.
Hope you can stay a little longer.
We will meet soon.
No need, they have left.
Have some?
No, thans.
Your husband?
He's on a trip.
I will phone you around Friday.
Sorry to stay long.
Good night.
You are bac!
The bath's ready?
Have you bathed?
Not yet.
And you?
Not yet.
Why not, it is very late.
We didn't feel lie it.
Get my clothes ready.
We will go to bed first.
Good night!
Loo at this!
They didn't lie it?
It cost a lot.
Toio would be mad at this.
The way she ate.
Why bother buying so many?
You be careful!
Bad girl!
Delicious!
I am tired.
Massage for you?
No need.
Tomorrow, I will wash clothes, shampoo, and write to Shojiro.
Let's go to sleep.
Good night!
I saw boiled fish in Ginza, seems delicious.
I want to send some to Shojiro.
But I have no money.
I don't have any too.
What a pity.
I spent the money eating with Toio.
You are nice.
Can you go to sleep?
Shall I tell Kazuo to stop?
Never mind.
But you are tired.
The maids must get up early.
What will you do?
I will as her to stop.
Don't bother!
No problem.
Do as you lie, but tell her politely.
Can you stop playing the piano?
Why, noisy?
Mother can't sleep.
Thans.
I don't mind.
Good night.
Setsuo!
We must be more considerate of each other.
This time I might have been wrong.
Sometimes I have to swallow my complaints because... we live in the same house.
When the guest came this morning, you should have greeted them.
We thought it would disturb them.
Why?
Didn't you tell us to stay out?
Yes, I did.
Then...
If you had stayed out, it's all right.
But when you came bac you should have greeted them.
And Tanimoto was one of the guests
Mother nows her, doesn't she?
No one lies to admit she is wrong.
They soon learn what is wrong with other people.
But they must bear it for each other's sae.
Right?
Do you understand?
Understand? Good night.
They have trouble?
Neither of them is wrong.
It happens because they must live together in that house.
Maybe.
They are in a bad mood sometimes.
Moving may be good diversion for mother.
Fine, I will let them stay here.
Really?
Than you.
I hope Ryoichi studies hard... even with his Grandmother here, but with her around he might not obey me.
I will warn them about it.
All right.
After staying here, they might move to Ayao's.
Will the maid come, too?
Yes, they will bring lots of things.
And the bird, too.
Want to wor?
What about a cler?
What ind of job do you want?
Don't, your friend may be woring.
But you are different.
Don't thin so casually. It is not only your concern.
Please consider us! Your father would be disgraced.
What will the others thin if you go out to wor?
Dad died, we may not be well off.
But you have no need to wor.
Our situation is not that worse.
Don't thin too much.
Your wedding is coming.
Give up this stupid idea.
Understand?
Don't thin about it again!
Suppose I went shopping and found you as the cler.
I will be ashamed.
Are you sure?
Anyone around?
Go clean upstairs.
Hey!
Where are my clothes?
Please prepare for me.
And a coat.
Going out?
Did my son go to school yesterday?
Every day?
Of course.
But his teacher wants to meet me.
He hasn't been to school.
The teacher said he is often absent.
I wonder what happened.
Any ideas?
Come to thin of it.
One day, you were out and he was home.
I ased him why he wasn't at school.
He said he had fought with a friend of his.
When was it?
When I was still living with Soichiro.
Why didn't you tell me?
I should have.
I'm sorry. This might not have happened.
I suppose so. I should've told you.
It's too late for that.
I am sorry
It's no use apologizing.
But I made a promise with him then.
Promise for what?
Not to tell anybody if he behaves himself.
It is unreasonable.
You ept this secret from me?
You should tell me everything.
You didn't scold him?
Yes, I did.
It didn't wor. He did it again.
A promise with a little child?
Were you serious?
You should now about children.
You raised many on your own.
I was thoughtless.
Be more careful!
Tell me everything about him.
I want to raise him my way.
But you are only spoiling him.
You are right.
I was wrong, I am sorry and I will be careful.
Just stay away from my son.
Mrs Toda and Miss Setsuo have arrived.
Show them in.
Hello, Ayao.
How are you, mother?
Glad to see you.
Sorry, I have been going out when you came.
You should have phoned me before.
Yes, sorry.
I don't mind being a little bit late.
How are you Setsuo?
Ayao, can you do me a favour?
What's the matter?
About us.
We would lie to move to the villa in Kugenuma.
Why?
No special reason.
It is empty now.
What do you thin?
We should live here, but...
Sister and Brother agreed.
And we have decided.
You have decided?
Why go to that place? We have room here.
Thans.
You thin you can do it?
I will try.
It is inconvenient.
Really, I just thin you love to stay here.
Not really far away, you can visit us.
It is near the sea. You will lie it.
When will you go?
As soon as possible.
We will meet again before you go.
Then we leave first.
Stay awhile.
Why don't you order lunch?
Tae care!
Sorry that I must go now.
Here.
Waited long?
A little.
Sorry.
I have a guest.
Who?
Mother and Sis.
For what?
Guess?
It's our turn now?
No, they will move to the villa.
Really?
Should be.
We are lucy, right?
They sipped us.
We wouldn't get on with them, and then?
I said, see you again.
But I feel sorry.
Why?
After I came here, the first thing I sewed... was a baby dress for Setsuo.
Loo at her. She has grown into such a lovely girl.
Yes.
She is really nice.
When she was born, I told Mr Toda.
It's a girl.
And he said, a girl again?
Girl is worthless.
So I said, "Babies can't be born without women ".
He said that he new and laughed.
Did that happen?
Such a long time ago.
Time flies, doesn't it?
It's already been a year since Mr Toda passed away.
Yes.
I feel lie many years have passed.
A lot of things has happened, I feel tired.
Things change so wuicly, don't they?
May be.
Thans for your help!
That's all right.
Is there any food, I am hungry?
Be nice.
It is tea time.
Anything will do.
It is not Toyo.
Tae a loo.
There are some caes.
I will tae some.
Hurry!
Toio may come tomorrow evening.
Saturday?
Guess what she will wear?
No idea.
Just one?
A dress.
No, a imono made from the cloth you gave her.
My prize.
It is too soon.
Will Shojiro come to Father's first death ceremony?
I don't now!
He should come bac.
He may be busy.
He lives far away, I just want him is going well.
I hope he can come.
He may not able to come.
Thin so?
I am glad everything went well today.
The rain stopped in the morning.
Glad that it didn't rain.
Shojiro came, too.
You never change, we were worried about you.
The sea was so rough, sorry I was late.
Father must be very happy.
Today's sutra was long.
I ased the priest to mae it short.
My legs are tired.
Ryoichi couldn't even stand up.
How is life in China?
What do you mean?
Do you go fishing?
No, I am wuite busy recently.
You may tae a rest.
I will call you later.
Why do Mother and Setsuo live at the villa?
No special reason.
Why don't they live with you?
Have been.
What has happened?
They moved to Chizuo's home.
Then?
They stayed at my house.
And?
They decided to move out.
I don't believe it.
I decided to move.
Please eep out of this, Mother.
Why do you let them live in such place?
When we wanted to sell it you said that it was worthless.
It is too old to live.
I was surprised Mother and Setsuo moved there.
I thought they were happy to live with you.
We had our reason.
What is it?
You were not here.
That's not the reason.
It is the wuestion of your sincerity.
Don't tell me you thin Mother's only in the way.
Don't ever thin I now nothing.
May be I have trusted you too much.
I should have looed after her myself.
I should have decided it earlier.
Children should be ind and warm to their mother.
But you haven't. Even for just a year.
Even when we are together today.
Father would not be happy.
Why didn't you as them to move in?
Mother has decided it.
Why didn't you as her to come to your place?
Why?
I've thought about it.
Then why didn't you as her?
But...
No "But ", you tal without doing anything.
Where is your sincerity?
How rude!
Who's rude?
Leave!
But...
Leave!
Ayao, come here!
Sit down!
You leave too!
Thin it over.
Will you leave too?
Of course.
Then go!
Goodbye, my best to Ryoichi.
Soichiro, do you thin I am wrong?
If not, please leave.
Go ahead.
You pay for this food later.
Stop crying.
It taught them a lesson.
It is best to bawl them out lie I did.
I may have ruined Father's death anniversary.
But it will help them get along with each other.
Father would be glad.
Don't cry.
Mother, Setsuo. Let's eat together.
Everything is going well.
Don't cry again.
Eat something, there is lots of food.
I'll loosen my belt.
Very delicious, mother, eat some.
I can't get this in China.
Eat more, get fat.
Hope I can stay with you.
But it's a very important time for my wor.
I can't just leave at this moment.
How about this... both of you go with me.
What do you thin?
I am already an old woman.
Age doesn't matter.
Old people climb mountains and visit temples.
What's wrong with you going to Tianjin?
Really?
Of course!
No one there will care about whatever you do.
Just do what you thin is best. Don't mind what people say.
Sticing to appearances, you can't do a thing.
Why not going?
You can relax in China.
You will feel as if the sy were higher there.
Brother and sister have already apologized so you can stay in Toyo and live with one of them.
But I want you to come with me.
Let's go!
What do you thin?
I don't mind.
You don't?
Let's decide. It's nice there.
Well, if you really don't mind.
It's done. How about you?
Yes.
If you don't mind, let's go.
It's good, It's really nice.
Let's go together! It has been decided, right?
This bird, it won't be ignored anymore.
Listen. Can we tal?
About what?
What is this?
Why don't you get married?
I now a very nice girl.
What do you thin? Do you already have someone you lie?
Do you?
No.
Listen, she is a nice girl.
Who?
I have a friend.
Pretty?
Very nice and honest.
I can't believe you have such a friend.
Who?
Toio
That ordinary girl?
What do you thin?
I am too good for her.
No, she is too good for you.
Am I that ugly?
Mother lies her.
So, she is the best for you.
Mother loves her?
Don't mention your mother, do you love her?
Not really.
Don't lie her?
Not really.
Then, what is it?
I will leave it up to you, thin deeply.
She is not that awful. Then it's oay?
It's done.
Wait! It's now my turn to say something.
About your marriage, leave it to me. I didn't as too much.
You can't either.
A really good and strong man.
You don't lie him?
There are so many men for you to choose.
I will pic the best one for you.
Leave it to me.
Tae it easy.
Don't loo down on me.
Mom, it is Toio.
She is here.
Who?
Toio, I will tal with her. You meet her later.
No.
Why?
I am bashful.
You are lying!
I mean it!
You will meet her, all right?
No, I won't meet her.
Let me handle it.
So do as I say, all right?
I am still bashful.
It is not lie you.
Just act cheerfully as usual.
Impossible, this is different.
Everyone has his weaness.
Even a hero.
Many heroes has weanesses.
No excuses!
I won't see her.
Then I will bring her here.
Thans for the gift!
It's alright. I hope you lie it.
Hello.
Hello
Glad you have come. Which train?
Towards Shimbashi.
Crowded?
She has brought a gift.
Than you.
It's for your brother.
Thans!
What's this?
Something to go with Sae.
So nice, he will lie it.
I'll tae it to him.
Where is he?
He went out just now.
THE MURDERER LIVES...
Cheers.
Here's to the barman!
Thank you, sir.
Ernest, the door!
It wasn't me. I've got my hands full.
It must have opened by itself.
We should fix that.
It's not good to drink, as a rule.
It makes you drunk and sick.
But sometimes you've got to drink.
It makes you happy and cleans the kidneys.
Especially muscadet.
Am I right?
Sure.
Even if I was wrong, I'd be right today, just this once.
Because this is no ordinary day. It's a special day.
Right, Baroness?
Crème de menthe!
Pardon, Marquise.
What do I owe you?
22 muscadets at three francs each, that's 66.
Take it from this.
I doubt we have change for 5,000, do we, Alfred?
I very much doubt it. - Wait, I have smaller notes.
Here, underneath.
Who's that?
Some guy who won the lottery.
66 from 1,000.
He's been going round all the bars since five, flaunting his cash.
Lucky devil.
Where did you buy the ticket?
I didn't buy it, I was given it.
Some guy I opened the door for who didn't have any change.
What a sucker! Just as well these guys exist.
What will you do with the money?
First, I'll buy some shoes.
I've worn rope shoes for ten years.
I like espadrilles.
They're comfy and they're quiet too.
Sure, Duchess, but they wear the feet out.
Thank you.
I'm off. It's past baby's bedtime.
Have you got far to go?
To Jaurès.
Watch out for Mr Durand!
Who?
The murderer.
Do you believe that farce?
Four murders in a month and all in this neighbourhood.
So they say.
I think it's just a stunt to sell newspapers.
If Durand is so clever, why does he always leave his card?
Leaving by yourself?
Do you want to be my nanny?
I've got what it takes.
Sorry, I've already been weaned.
Good evening, gentlemen.
Good evening.
Are you free?
Where to?
Jaurès?
No chance!
The Chief of Police is here.
Come in.
Morning, Minister. - Hello, Edouard.
Are things as bad as that?
What?
You only call me that when you've got bad news.
Edouard...
Again?
This is getting serious. - You mean Mr Durand?
Obviously.
Drastic measures must be taken.
Right, but which?
What do you mean?
You must arrest him.
I'd like to.
Well, then?
He won't let me.
I can't shield you for much longer.
If you haven't nabbed him in a fortnight...
I'm gone.
Quietly.
Goodbye...
Albert.
Please come in, Commissioner.
Hello, sir.
Any progress on the Durand case?
Not much.
That's a pity, but I'll be generous.
You have a week to catch him.
If after that time you have the misfortune to fail...
You will accept my resignation.
On grounds of ill health, of course.
Good day, sir.
This has gone far enough. Do you hear?
If Durand isn't arrested in four days, you're out.
Understood?
Yes, sir.
You have no time to waste!
No, sir.
Is Wens in his office?
Yes, Chief.
If Durand isn't caught in two days, I get the sack.
Patient... yet prudent.
How wonderful to be an Impresario!
You're like a gardener who grows delicate plants, like a pile of manure warming tender shoots.
Thank you.
And I am the climbing plant, reaching for the sky.
I need support.
Yes.
I'm like America before Christopher Columbus.
I'm waiting.
For what?
I'm waiting to be discovered...
Christopher.
So you need a job?
The Opéra Comique considered me for The Marriage of Figaro.
As Cherubino. Such a beautiful part!
It climbs three octaves.
I hit the fourth straight off.
The director said, "She's too high, too good."
Just my luck! Always too good.
Just as I had a foot in the door...
It slammed shut in your face.
And yet I have talent.
I've been holding it back to stop it from escaping.
But when it comes out, it will be explosive.
I'm like dynamite.
The mail, sir.
Thank you, miss.
Please take me on. You won't regret it.
I'd like to, but...
Has someone been spreading slander about me, out of spite?
Slander...
Please...
You see?
I can go high or low at will.
That's hardly genius.
I never said it was.
But others can't do it and they get hired.
Yes, but they have...
What?
What do they have?
Oh, I see...
You dirty old man! You're barking up the wrong tree.
My talent is for the stage, not the casting couch!
What do they have, eh?
They have a reputation.
What?
They have a reputation. That's what people want.
This Mr Durand, for example.
Now there's a name for you.
He would fill the theatres.
I'd sign Mr Durand in an instant.
Hang on a minute.
So if my name were in the papers, you'd sign me?
In a flash!
See you tomorrow.
Well?
I got hired!
In principle.
Thought so.
There's just one small formality.
What?
I need to arrest Mr Durand.
Is that all?
What do you mean, is that all?
You're making fun of me with your irony.
You're just jealous.
You're afraid I'll show you up!
No, but I pity Mr Durand.
And so you should. He's got it coming to him.
Where are you going?
To start my investigation.
Every man for himself?
See you at the finish line.
The pay?
In the office in five minutes.
100,000 francs.
Imagine how many dishes I'd get for that.
Kitting out your kitchen?
It's for Germaine, not me.
It's her little extravagance.
As her husband I have to indulge it.
Some wives have a thing about clothes.
With her it's unbreakable china dishes.
I bought her a small one.
What happened?
I dropped it before we'd had a chance to use it.
It broke on impact.
Right, I'm off.
Goodbye.
Germaine will be wondering where I am.
Off to fulfil your marital duties?
With Germaine it's a pleasure, not a duty.
Get your hands off me!
I'm a respectable woman. Take that!
I want to see the sergeant.
I only deal with high-ranking officers. I'm not interested in subordinates.
Sergeant. I really am very fond of policemen.
Parisian policemen are absolute darlings.
But not these two!
They're vultures.
They had nothing to get their teeth into so they pounced on poor little me.
I didn't say or do anything.
She was cycling without lights.
Do you expect me to do my rounds all lit up?
How would that look?
Your rounds?
I'm looking for Mr Durand. I'm like St Genevieve.
Defending Paris against Attila.
What is she on about?
Go back to school and learn your geography.
So you had no lights on?
So that Durand wouldn't spot me.
That's no reason to arrest a defenceless girl.
Look what we found in her bag!
I have to be able to defend myself.
Where did you get this?
It was a gift.
From whom?
Santa!
It was in my stocking.
This is a police revolver.
You're staying here tonight.
Take her away.
Oh, no! You can't arrest me.
I'm a singer. What if I catch a cold?
I'm very fragile. My friends will make fun of me.
Please, don't do this.
Call my friend.
Screw your friend!
You don't know who he is.
I don't care if he's the Pope!
The Pope?
I'm not sleeping with the Pope!
I have a sense of propriety. I'm religious too.
My friend is Inspector Vorobietchik.
Call headquarters. You'll see.
At this hour?
He always works late.
Meanwhile, I knit shoes for the baby, if he's capable of making one.
When he was on the throne
Up high, up high
When he was on the throne,
He then began to sing
He began to sing
Hey!
I piss on all policemen
UP high, up high
I piss on all policemen
And the entire constabulary And the entire constabulary
Is that meant for me?
Who else would it be for?
I hope there are no other cops in the vicinity.
You're lucky I'm off duty.
What are you doing up there?
Waiting for the bus.
The bus?
Yes, the F.U.
The bus won't wait for you up there.
If I were you, I'd climb down onto the pavement.
I haven't found what I'm looking for.
Which is?
My matchbox.
Up there?
The light's better up here.
Do you take me for a...
Yes, a big fat one!
Do you know something?
You're so ugly, you disgust me. You're hideous.
Isn't he awful, madame?"
I feel sorry for your wife. - What did you say?
She must be in good shape to keep up with a porker like you!
God damn it!
I'll teach you some manners!
Calm down!
What's got into you?
You pig!
You're hurting me!
Steady on!
Come on, get a move on.
I'm going to make you pay for making me come back.
What's going on?
He's blind drunk, that's what.
Just take it easy.
Get me Odéon 4380.
Police headquarters?
I want to talk to the Chief.
You'll talk to my boot!
There's no need to be rude.
I have something to tell the Chief, a personal message.
The Chief?
That's me.
Mr Wens!
You can go now. Thank you.
If I'm not mistaken...
Jean-Baptiste.
You old crook!
You have a good memory for faces.
Never forget 'em.
Four years ago, I found two diamond bracelets on you.
Family heirlooms.
And an 18th-century miniature.
My great-grandmother's.
You had a moustache.
Suited me, didn't it?
A fine set of whiskers.
Shaved it off for a blonde, who was really a brunette.
They're all the same!
Can we talk in private?
So now you act drunk and go around insulting policemen?
Insulting them? I only called him a porker.
With your record, you could get two weeks.
I hope so. A fortnight would fly by.
And I'd be safe.
Safe from what?
Safe from accidents.
You're afraid of someone?
Yes, because I'm here to give you an address.
A good address, Mr Durand's.
That's nice of you.
When I say give it to you, I mean for a price.
Why didn't you just walk into the station?
I don't want to end up dead in the gutter tomorrow night with a card on my belly.
Durand can't harm you tomorrow if we arrest him today.
Not so fast.
I know where he lives, but not who he is.
A boarding house on Avenue Junot, Les Mimosas.
The murderer lives there at number 21.
How do you know?
It's simple.
I've been a rag and bone man since I went straight.
Two days ago, the landlady of Les Mimosas stopped me to fetch some junk from her attic.
I loaded it up on my cart and rode home to sort through it.
In the chest of drawers, an old ugly one with a leg missing, what do I see but calling cards?
Good quality card with "Mr Durand" written on them.
So what?
You're usually quicker off the mark.
I'm not on form tonight.
All the same.
Durand lives there, but in case they search his room, he hides his cards in the attic where they could be anyone's.
It's not difficult.
Do you have the cards?
Here.
Damn, I've lost them!
Might these be them?
Very funny!
I found them under a street lamp.
That's lucky.
How about my money?
I could alert police headquarters and we could raid the premises, but Durand's not stupid so he'd flee and you wouldn't get any money.
That's the first solution.
Bad idea.
But I'd be covered.
Second solution.
You let us lock you up, you keep your mouth shut and you leave me to quietly lead my investigation.
I'd prefer that.
So you trust me?
As if you were my sister.
You're like her. You both love your job.
What does she do?
She runs a brothel in Clermont.
If I'm not back in two days, take this letter to police headquarters.
Where are you going?
I'm not saying.
I'll pester you until you do.
You know me.
Indeed I do.
Tell me and I'll be good all week.
I'm going to the seaside.
To do what?
To walk the dog.
You don't have a dog.
I'll buy one.
Are you pulling my leg?
Fine.
I won't let you go.
I'll bolt the door.
I'll go out the window.
If you leave, I'll run up debts.
I'll buy a mink coat.
Where are you going?
What was that?
Are you sick?
No, I'm mute.
Where are my pyjamas?
Never mind, I'll sleep naked.
So that's it!
There's another woman.
You're too smart.
No soap or toothbrush then.
I don't care.
I'm sure you don't.
She probably doesn't either.
She must be a real pig.
She sounds just your type!
Listen, Mila, why are you being so nasty?
Because I love you.
If I didn't, I wouldn't be jealous.
You're not jealous, you're cantankerous.
I've always been a bit malicious, but deep down I'm a nice person.
Now, you be nice and tell me where you're going?
I'm going to be working, you silly fool.
Have you found a lead?
I hope so.
You're so clever.
My fox has found a lead!
I'm off, Mila.
Will it be dangerous?
So brave too.
That's what I love about you.
Will you think of me when you're dead?
I want your last thoughts to be of me.
Because I've always loved you. I've never deceived you.
You won't find anyone up there to butter your bread and make coffee.
Don't make such a face.
Goodbye, darling.
Goodbye, my love.
Have you made a will?
Your canary sings well.
That was me whistling, not him.
I've tried teaching him but he doesn't want to learn.
Maybe he's mute.
Ferdinand, mute?
You must be joking.
He has a great voice. But he's like Tino. He uses it sparingly.
Did you hear that, Ferdinand?
Your laziness fails to impress.
Make an effort!
Armand!
Go and help Juliette with the beds when you've finished.
And stop your whistling.
This is not a prison.
It's a boarding house so shut your mouth.
But Mrs Point...
No buts.
It's annoying.
He's preparing an act.
It's the bedrooms that need preparing.
Were you in the attic in the middle of the night?
Me?
Yes, I heard footsteps upstairs.
Not me. I sleep like a log.
Don't worry, I'll figure it out.
Now get a move on.
Was it you, Mr Colin?
No, I had a busy day yesterday, selling junk.
I fell straight asleep.
You left your light on.
And I pay the electricity!
What's new?
You were wanted upstairs.
Trouble?
Miss Cuq wouldn't leave the bathroom.
Dr Linz wanted in. He made a big fuss.
They can sort that out themselves. Miss Cuq can defend herself.
There she is. The siege must be over.
Good morning. How is everyone? Well?
Glad to hear it.
Forgive me if I don't stop to chat but I must get to work.
Quite right. When inspiration calls...
I don't believe in inspiration.
It's concentration we writers need.
I concentrate every day from nine to 12 and four to seven.
It doesn't sound much but it requires discipline.
I can believe it. Here. A package came for you.
Return to sender".
One of your manuscripts, I fear.
Heart's Awakening rejected.
Don't cry. Maybe it was too concentrated.
Not many new lodgers recently.
Pity, I love new housemates.
Naturally, you always think you're in with a chance.
Don't forget, Doctor, that you're talking to a real lady.
Real ladies don't spend an hour in the bathroom.
You must have been spying on me, like you were this morning.
Spying? You think I looked through the keyhole?
I wouldn't be surprised.
You're wrong.
I've never found ancient ruins an attractive sight.
I'll have a whisky, Mrs Point.
At nine in the morning?
What?
Just thinking aloud.
A man's free to think, no?
You thinking? That'll be the day!
Come now, gentlemen.
A whisky for number 17.
I won't be insulted by some petty salesman.
I served 25 years in the bush.
So you tell us 20 times a day.
Stop arguing and give me a light.
May I?
Ah, Professor. Always there for me.
Do you want breakfast?
All I want is to kiss your rosy fingertips.
No hot chocolate?
Well, if you insist.
Hot chocolate for number 14.
With cream.
With cream.
I'd like to know which son of a bitch was in the attic last night.
Did I wake you?
It was you, Professor?
Yes, and I'll never forgive myself.
What were you doing up there?
Well, this may sound silly, but I also heard footsteps above my head.
Muffled footsteps that were hard to ignore.
I found it so intriguing I simply had to go up.
Then what?
Then...
Not a soul.
You had a nightmare.
You shouldn't eat so much.
It's Mrs Point's fault. She's an excellent cook.
A gentleman to see you.
Have you shown him into my office?
No, Madame.
He is here.
Sorry if I frightened you.
No, Pastor.
I just wasn't expecting you.
I'm sure.
In Montmartre you tend to meet more whores than pastors.
I meant more lost souls than ministers of religion.
I got your gist.
Can I help you?
I'd like a room. Anything free?
I only have double rooms. - So?
I thought a pastor might find that shocking.
We're not celibate, madam.
I've been married nine years.
We're expecting our eighth child.
Goodness!
It's quite natural.
I wouldn't know. I'm a lady.
Congratulations.
Possibly.
Are you visiting Paris?
Yes, for a church conference.
And they sent you to Les Mimosas?
No, it was chance that brought me here.
Providence, if you will.
A providential chance.
I was reading my Bible as I passed your door when I read the words, "Knock, and the door shall be opened to you."
A man answered, crowing like a cock.
Then he led me in with the nightingale's song.
That was Armand.
The manservant.
He's preparing an act.
Naturally.
Let me introduce you.
Mr Colin...
A humble craftsman.
Dr Linz...
Colonial service, retired.
Miss Cuq.
A maiden lady.
And our star guest, Professor Lalah-Poor.
A scholar?
An artiste.
A master of manipulation and a man of mystery.
Do you value your wedding ring?
My wife does.
Don't give it to the professor.
He turned Mrs Point's ring into an iron.
Don't worry, I'll be careful.
I may even try to discover his tricks.
If it amuses you.
It interests me.
One must not focus on what is seen but on what is not seen.
Hot chocolate.
Whisky.
A whisky to celebrate your arrival?
No, thank you.
So you can have children, but not whisky?
I can, but I only drink my own.
If you'll allow me.
I know the colonies well.
Where were you?
The middle of nowhere.
Where exactly?
I moved around.
So did I. We can reminisce.
If you return from hell you prefer to forget.
That's a bold thing to say. No one ever returns from hell.
Cheers!
I'll show you to your room.
Number 13, if you don't mind.
Perfectly natural. I'm not superstitious.
I'll follow you.
I forgot to introduce myself. My name is Robert Lester.
I try to help people find salvation.
I'm at your service.
If you receive this letter; it means I am dead.
Certain clues lead me to believe that the murderer we are after lives at Les Mimosas, 21 Avenue Junot.
Yours posthumously, Wens.
Do you mind if I read while you whistle?
Go ahead, so long as you're quiet.
I can't stand noise when I work.
Neither can I.
I can understand that.
I'll go to my room then.
You do that, Pastor.
And if anyone makes any noise, let me know.
We don't tolerate noise in this house.
You are beautiful.
You exaggerate, but I was a beautiful baby.
A boarder?
Don't you recognise him?
That's Kid Robert.
It's shocking to see him in such a state.
I thought he was dead.
He might as well be.
A blind boxer is useless.
To think... Did you see that fight in Buffalo?
The women reached for their binoculars when he took off his robe.
Vanity of vanities. All is vanity and vexation of spirit."
Of course.
Oh, it's you, Pastor.
I'm sorry.
Wrong door.
Do come in!
I hate to intrude.
I like a bit of conversation and I rarely get spoiled that way here.
These are trousers for my figurines. As you can see, I make dolls.
I see you've noticed. They don't have faces.
That's my gimmick.
They used to deliver these stupid, blank faces.
I hated putting them on my dolls.
Then one day I got an idea from the newspaper.
Mr Durand, the faceless killer."
Why not make Durand with a ball instead of a head?
The retailers wanted me to add a question mark.
But I refused. It was too crass.
The blankness is far scarier. You can read into it what you will.
I make Durands who stab, shoot or strangle.
It's horrible but it pays.
And I could use the money, to be honest with you.
Life hasn't been kind to me so far.
When I say life, I mean people.
People can be so cruel.
Just like animals. Take this place, for example.
Miss Cuq is harmless, but Dr Linz...
Do you know what Dr Linz did?
He's done time.
He was charged with abortion three years ago.
Nice fellow, eh?
At least we know where we stand with him.
Lalah-Poor is different, a complete mystery.
He hasn't worked in months. So what does he live on?
It's a mystery, and a sinister one at that, believe me.
Some say he pays Mrs Point in kind.
I don't know. But I do know the landlady.
Matters of the flesh may interest her, but she prefers money.
But I shouldn't speak ill of my neighbours.
Quite right, Mr Colin. Charity.
Charity above all.
Oh, I forgot Kid Robert and his nurse.
Save it for next time.
Come in, Pastor.
Make yourself at home.
Sorry, I've got the wrong room.
It's nice to see you and to make your acquaintance.
Come in!
The show is about to begin.
You have before you the one and only Lalah-Poor!
My father's name was Tree Sparrow.
One day he disappeared. Off he flew. No more Tree Sparrow.
Guess who they found in his place.
The one and only Lalah-Poor.
Believe it or not.
I believe you.
Good for you.
Come and look at my things.
Isn't that funny?
Do you collect empty frames?
No, paintings. I love paintings.
That used to be a Vuillard sketch but I made it disappear by mistake.
Like the hands of the clock, the lampshade and the telephone cord.
Hello, anyone there?
No one. He's vanished too.
It's become second nature to me.
Objects in my hand just disappear.
I scare myself sometimes, though I'm easy-going.
I'm a good-natured fellow. I like everybody.
Even the boarders here?
Especially them.
How could you not like them? You're lucky.
It's rare to find such decent folk.
Colin, for instance, may seem a little grumpy at first but he's top drawer.
And Miss Cuq...
Have you read anything of hers?
I'm afraid not.
Ask her for a manuscript and see for yourself.
She has style. Better still, she has a style.
And Dr Linz...
You really have to admire him.
But I was told...
Ah yes, that unfortunate affair.
They were right to tell you.
But between us, how many men do you know who would risk their career out of pity for an unhappy woman?
Dr Linz is one such man.
We should be proud to live under the same roof as him.
There.
Well, let me thank you for your visit.
Oh, I forgot to return your wallet.
An innocent prank.
Well played.
Oh, I forgot...
Here's your wallet.
I'm sorry, wrong room.
Easily done.
How is the new lodger?
She'll be right down.
And the Pastor?
Here I am.
Come and sit on my right, Pastor.
Hear, ye people! The Lord is witness against you."
The faithful city has become a prostitute."
It was once righteous but now it houses murderers."
But darkness will not reign forever on Earth"
with its anguish."
Thus sayeth the Lord:"
I will spurn my adversaries and avenge my enemies."
They shall drink in my wrath."
The wicked shall be like tinder. They shall go up in flames."
They shall burn together, and no one shall extinguish them."
Amen!
Bravo!
That was sweet.
You have good lungs.
I'm impressed.
Mr Colin should know.
These gentlemen used to give concerts for us.
You sang? - I wouldn't have dared.
I merely scraped my violin.
Scraped is right!
Doctor, I've never criticised your cello playing.
Won't you all be so kind as to accompany me?
Unfortunately, Dr Linz and I don't see eye to eye musically.
It's a pity because you have a ravishing voice.
Really?
It's a pleasure to meet people who know music.
My boyfriend never lets me sing.
Doesn't he like your voice?
Him?
You must be joking. He's a fool.
What does he do?
He shows off, and he's not even good at that.
All he's good for is selling chestnuts outside cafés.
Poor child. You've had a hard time.
In my experience, you can't expect anything from men.
Not at your age!
What do you mean?
Your goose is cooked. I'm yet to be plucked.
Is that right?
Anyway, I've found a way to stop publishers from rejecting me.
You're giving up writing?
No.
I'm writing a thriller.
That's all we need.
I have a great idea, a truly original setting.
A haunted castle. Can you picture it?
Sweating walls, the sound of chains.
Oh, sure.
But I'd prefer somewhere less sinister.
Why not set it in a restaurant?
A man eating soup with a knife in his back.
Or better still, why not in a small hotel?
Or a furnished apartment, or...
A music hall.
I prefer my haunted castle.
You'd be right at home there.
The detective is what matters.
He could be an elderly doctor with a white beard.
That's boring, and depressing!
Why not a man in uniform?
Like an officer... a priest... a postman.
Anyway, my killer will be a vampire.
A vampire?
It's not my day!
I'm just being frank.
Whoever heard of a man sucking blood?
I'd have him kill for money. It's more natural.
And forget this Düsseldorf business.
Call him Dupont... or Dubois,
OF...
Duschnock.
Why not Durand?
Good idea.
Not this again!
He's always going on about Mr Durand.
Mr Durand is a great man, an exceptional being.
He's a horrible monster!
Because he occasionally kills off the odd lowlife?
My only gripe is that he uses a dagger and a shoelace rather than a machine gun, dynamite and toxic gas.
Do you justify murder?
No, slaughter.
I like Durand because he is a serial killer.
But he robs his victims. So what?
They misuse their money.
You're an anarchist.
And you're a pathetic fool.
Durand is justified by the existence of people like you.
If he could hear me, you'd be his next victim. Thank you.
You're too kind.
But Durand will be caught by then.
By the police?
Don't make me laugh.
Durand is too smart for that bunch.
If God exists, he'll be caught.
That's a big "if".
I hope you don't doubt it.
The Pastor is with me. Durand will be caught.
I'm not sure about caught, but he will be damned. - He already is.
And he's proud of it.
Dr Linz, you know so much about Durand.
Are you a friend of his?
A friend? No.
Could you be Mr Durand?
Think what you like.
You're not Durand.
How do you know?
Because Mr Durand... is me!
I'll prove it.
Watch me carefully. Pay attention.
It's dead.
Poor bird.
That's why I'm Durand.
Forgive me, Professor, but that's not funny.
I'm sorry, dear friend, but it makes me laugh.
Wait!
I've found my story, thanks to this young lady.
The setting is a boarding house, Les Mimosas.
Mr Durand is one of the guests, one of you.
The detective sneaks in, disguised as a cleric.
Forgive me, Pastor.
Go right ahead.
The first chapter is taken up by conversation, as now.
But immediately afterwards, when everyone has gone to bed, there is a murder.
A fine, bloody murder.
Well, well!
Blood, blood, blood!
Let it flow.
Rivers of blood!
Stop it, you fools!
You're unleashing evil forces.
What's got into you?
Nothing, but mark my words:
Tragedy will strike tonight.
Help me, Vania.
Ten past midnight and no news from your inspector.
No sign of him. Vorobietchik has disappeared.
For good.
Or else he's had his throat slit or been shot in the head.
Who is it?
Put him on.
Yes, who is this?
Who?
Mr Durand.
Send your men to Les Mimosas.
That's where I live.
You'll find a warm corpse there.
He hung up.
Listen!
Here is the correct time.
At the fourth stroke, it will be 12:13am.
Igor him!
Wens, my darling!
Wake up! Snap out of it!
Help!
Open up!
What's happened?
Call the doctor!
What's happened?
I think I've killed him.
I'm sure he's dead.
Who?
My darling Wens!
It's the Pastor!
Saint Anthony, I beseech you.
Bring him back. Don't let him die.
Poor girl.
Someone's at the door.
Armand, get the door!
Can't you hear someone's ringing?
I'll see what's up!
Police. Where's the body?
What body?
Wasn't someone killed here?
You know already?
First floor.
Stay here. You too.
Let me through.
Good God, Wens!
It was me, Mr Monnet.
You're here?
I killed him.
What is the meaning of this?
I thought he was going to attack me.
Do you mind?
Of course.
He's just unconscious.
What are you doing?
Fetching water to revive him.
Doctor, this newspaper with Durand's name cut out was found in your room.
I never read Le Petit Parisien. This is Colin's newspaper.
I never lock my door.
You took it to frame me.
The victim was stabbed with a lancet from this case.
Yes. - Your case.
But someone took it.
Who?
You're accusing me?
I'm not accusing anyone, but you did ask to see my instruments this afternoon.
Excuse me, but you insisted on showing them to me.
I didn't ask you for anything.
You make me sick!
I thought you were a fool but you're a pathetic Tartuffe.
That's enough!
Try to deny it, but we have Kid Robert's testimony.
Durand called the Chief Inspector at 12:10am.
Precisely three minutes later, these two witnesses heard a man limping up the stairs.
Only you limp here.
This is a plot against me!
Get dressed. You're coming with us.
Just a second.
What?
Aren't you dead?
Yes, quite dead.
Thank God I came to just in time to hear your interrogation.
It would have been a shame to miss it. What a lesson! What genius!
Durand's not that smart. We simply acted promptly.
Too promptly, if you don't mind me saying.
I've never seen such observation, so much skill employed, only to make... a mistake.
A mistake?
Yes, a glaring mistake.
Still, your reasoning was beautiful.
I'll forgive you owing to your injury. The blood must have gone to your head.
Perhaps.
But Durand and the Doctor are the same person.
Take him away then.
What are you waiting for?
You think I lack proof?
You have too much proof. That's what worries me.
Dr Linz, will you walk up the stairs?
Go ahead.
That's enough.
Can you tell me if those were the footsteps you heard tonight?
I'm not sure. I think so.
No, it wasn't like that.
It sounded different.
What's this all about?
Now listen.
That's it!
Naturally.
Someone imitated the Doctor's limp, and like all imitators, he overdid it.
Who last saw Miss Cuq alive?
I brought her some camomile tea at 11:00.
She said she couldn't sleep.
No one entered the house after that?
No, Pastor. I mean, Detective.
Everyone was home, so I bolted the door.
Therefore, the murderer is one of you.
Did anyone use the bathroom after 11:00?
No one?
Sorry, Mr Colin, I can't lie.
He came out at 11:30. - Really?
I was going to see Kid Robert.
Why were you going to his room at that hour?
Kid Robert is my patient.
Of course.
And you went to care for him. Perfectly natural.
How about it, Mr Colin?
I never left my bed all evening.
I saw you!
I'm not accusing you, Colin, but I'm fairly certain I heard you enter your room right around that time.
A coincidence, I trust.
What did you want in the bathroom?
Merely to take a bath. Sure.
Taking a bath at midnight is perfectly natural.
I was tense.
Come with me.
I thought a warm bath would relax me.
Yes, but why didn't you say so before?
I didn't know...
I mean, I forgot she'd seen me.
Right. So you went into the bathroom to...
To wash.
Very well, take off your robe.
Now your pyjamas.
The bottoms.
Socks. - What?
Take off your socks.
If you've taken a bath, your feet should be clean.
Let's see.
No need for questions, I'll tell you everything I know.
This isn't my first interview.
It was a glittering evening.
I was asked to sing after dinner.
It went down very well.
I knew the killer was amongst us but I showed no fear.
After all, my grandfather served under Napoléon.
He rode beside the Emperor with a feather in his cap.
But that's another story.
What are you doing?
I'm practising for the reporters. Too late.
It's all here. Listen to this.
The nightmare is over."
Mr Durand was arrested by the police last night,"
thanks to the energy and skill of Mr Monnet,"
who heads up the special brigade."
Damn!
What about us?
They forgot us.
But at least we got Durand.
And all because he had dirty feet.
Get the door.
Where's the maid?
I sacked her. We had words.
Words?
She said I was catty.
Some truths are best left unsaid.
Cretin!
Compliments of Mr Durand
Arresting Colin was stupid. - Do you think so?
Idiotic.
I agree with you.
But it was your idea.
The papers are giving you all the credit.
Are you suggesting I took credit...
Perish the thought.
You'd have been sacked by now if I hadn't.
You want my resignation?
No, but if you offered it, I'd advise the Chief to accept it.
Then don't keep him waiting. Patient but respectful.
You released Colin?
I had to.
But I arrested Linz.
And this time, he'll confess.
I don't doubt it.
Patient but prescient.
How long have you been living at Mrs Point's house?
Five years.
Where did you live before that?
A hotel on the Champs-Elysées.
Which one?
The Claridge.
Why did you leave there?
It was too expensive.
And?
Carry on, we're in no hurry.
Do you have any debts?
Some. - Who with?
My tailor.
Is that all?
I think so.
But you said "some" debts.
I made a mistake.
Do you often go out at night?
Two or three times a week.
Where were you on 18 April?
18 April? I don't know.
The cinema, maybe. - Where?
I don't remember.
Then why did you say you went to the cinema?
You like to gamble.
I never gamble.
You were arrested four years ago at some dive in Marseille.
My friends dragged me there.
How much did you lose?
I don't know.
Well, nor do we.
But you owe money?
Like everyone.
Did you enter the bathroom? - I told you, no.
So you don't bathe?
Yes.
But when I went to take a bath, Miss Cuq was in there.
So you killed her. - No, that was in the morning.
When?
Yesterday.
Miss Cuq was dead yesterday.
I meant the day before. You're driving me crazy!
Confess and it will all be over.
I'm not a killer, I tell you!
Carry on questioning him. Ask him anything you like.
See you this evening.
Come in.
It's me.
What a nice surprise, Inspector.
I'm no longer an inspector. I resigned. This is a friendly visit, if I can call it that.
Won't Mila be jealous?
She doesn't know.
You're cautious.
I have to be.
Durand struck again while Colin was in jail.
So Colin isn't Durand. - I know.
He's back already.
Why did you say you'd seen him then?
I must have mistaken him. I'm very short-sighted.
That's dangerous.
What, myopia? No, giving false testimony.
I thought this was a friendly visit.
I'm speaking as a friend.
I can recommend an optician.
Thanks.
That's a lovely robe.
Actually, it's a negligee.
I wouldn't know. Mila wears flannel pyjamas.
Lucky you.
I can't talk. I wear a cotton nightcap. - You don't?
I do, with a pompom.
You must look sweet.
Ravishing, intoxicating, adorable.
Cover up or you'll catch a head cold.
Through my legs?
Depends on where your brain is.
I do find this lingerie to be quite risqué.
It's not common for a nurse.
But you see, when you wear a uniform all day with your hair covered up, it's nice to feel like a woman, with satin on your skin.
Does Kid Robert like it?
He's blind.
He can touch.
Now you're being indiscreet.
Isn't he your lover?
I took pity on him a few times.
Did he tell you to accuse Colin?
No.
Who did, then?
Nobody.
Just now in Lalah-Poor's room, I found a comb which looked just like this one.
Look, twins.
Well?
No more questions, please.
Do you love the conjurer?
Of course not!
But you slept with him.
Maybe once. It was over in a flash.
Why?
I got bored.
I'm always waiting for something.
You're not expecting him now?
No, don't worry.
He's at the theatre.
They hired him after all this publicity.
I think I'll pay a visit to the theatre then.
Leaving so soon?
I'd only disappoint you if I stayed.
Good evening.
I'm not talking to you.
Perfectly natural.
Come in.
Bob Destirac from Paris Soir.
Come in, young man. Don't be afraid.
The press is always welcome.
Art is nothing without publicity.
What do you want to know about?
The Indian tomb trick?
The mystery of the talking head?
Ask me anything you like.
Mind if I dress?
Go ahead... Mr Durand.
What's eating you?
Just my little joke.
I've decided to address all Mrs Point's lodgers that way to gauge their reactions.
It's a dangerous game. What if I were Mr Durand?
I could have sent you to a better world by now.
However, if you read the papers instead of writing them, you'd know that Durand is under arrest.
You think Dr Linz is the killer?
No.
Certainly not.
You should.
Given that Colin is innocent, the servant has an alibi and the blind man is incapable of committing a crime,
I see only one possible suspect.
Yet you feel uneasy about being here with me.
Not at all. I find this conversation fascinating.
But your suspicion is growing by the second.
No, I suspect you all.
Well, you're wrong.
How?
To suspect the others.
So you admit you're Mr Durand?
Yes, that's what I mean.
You admit you killed 11 people. More specifically...
Mr Levret at 11pm on 10 November, Avenue Clichy. Yes!
Mr Tavernin...
Yes!
Turn off that light!
Mr Tavernin at 7:30pm on the 12th, Rue Victor Massé.
Yes, anything you like.
OK.
Tell me what your motives were.
Money.
Each time?
Yes.
For Miss Cuq too?
Yes.
She didn't have any money.
I thought she had savings.
Why did you place a calling card on your victims' corpses?
Out of bravado.
Towards the police?
Yes, and society.
Now that we've warmed up, it's time to get down to business.
For my next act, I shall require the help of my assistant,
Christiane Perette.
Christiane Perette.
This is where our work begins.
We're binding Miss Perette's hands and feet so that she cannot make the slightest movement.
This trunk is completely empty. Completely empty.
We place the living corpse of Miss Christiane Perette in it.
Now we close the trunk.
One, two, three.
I'm taking a few steps.
With one shot from this revolver the subject will disappear.
Let me be clear. This is not a trick or a practical joke.
This is a scientific phenomenon known to scientists as "disintegration of matter".
Ready?
One... two... three!
The process has been a complete success.
What did you do with the money you stole?
I can't go on.
Where's the money?
I hid it. - Where?
That's my business.
What?
Dr Linz is innocent.
That's a good one. He's just confessed.
What?
Good Lord!
Stay there. I'll send two men over.
What's going on?
Why did you confess?
Are you protecting someone?
No, I wanted to be left in peace.
What do you have to say for yourself?
Nothing,
I'll wait until Durand claims his 13th victim.
Give me the handcuffs.
Do you have them?
Oh, sorry.
Well?
It's still going on.
Durand strangled another woman.
And the conjurer?
Innocent.
Poor thing.
Yet this time...
You're out of luck.
It's most discouraging.
Here, I'll squeeze your blackheads to cheer you up.
Get lost! - There are so many.
Leave me alone!
They'll only get bigger and leave pock marks.
Maybe Durand doesn't live at the house.
No one came in or went out while Miss Cuq was being murdered.
You're hurting me!
Stay still.
It's like vermicelli.
You've got a nerve!
What about the whistler?
He has numerous alibis.
I don't trust menservants.
We had one at school. He turned out to be a sex maniac.
That's irrelevant.
And the blind man?
He's blind.
Do you reckon?
I saw him blink when he took off his glasses.
You're crazy.
That only leaves Mrs Point.
It's not a woman's handiwork.
Maybe she's a man.
You never know under all that lard.
Hardly!
Anything's possible.
I'd get her to strip if I were you.
I'd say, "Show us!" That would settle the matter.
That's quite enough!
Let me! It's the last one.
Oh, it's a beauty!
The finest yet. The king of blackheads!
Come in. What do you want?
A letter for you both.
You big brute!
Mrs Point has invited us over to celebrate her lodgers' innocence.
She wants you to sing.
How nice of her.
You're going?
Yes. I don't get many offers.
Well, I'm not.
Oh, please come with me!
Never!
You're making a mistake, because Durand will be there.
A steamboat siren.
A station master's whistle, and then the train's.
A traffic cop whistling at a pedestrian crossing.
Did you see the grocer's daughters?
The whole neighbourhood is here.
They're a great crowd.
Why not go inside?
I wouldn't see any better.
Hey, no gloominess tonight.
We're celebrating our reconciliation.
Who'd have thought a week ago that we'd be playing together again?
Durand is good for something.
Where's the star?
In my room doing her makeup.
What are you doing?
Playing patience.
Have you seen the programme?
It's worth a look. I've never had such good billing.
I'm the last act in the first half. The American star.
Open it.
It won't hurt your eyes.
It says I'm a star of the stage.
Wait a minute.
What's wrong?
Don't you approve?
One act is missing. The sensation of the evening.
Mr Durand's arrest by the famous Inspector Wens.
You solved it?
Yes, it was simple.
Break a leg!
Wait a second.
And not a word to her Ladyship!
She's an old bag.
Everything all right?
Fine, thanks.
Are we disturbing you, Mila?
Not at all.
You look strange.
Me? Not at all.
Why should I look strange?
On the contrary, I'm perfectly normal.
What's got into you?
I promised not to say anything.
And when I promise to hold my tongue, my lips are sealed.
Just between us women.
Nothing doing!
If it's a secret, she's quite right.
It is a secret, isn't it?
You bet, and when it comes out, it will raise the roof.
Listen, all I can say is that Mr Durand is in for a hard time.
Don't ask me anything more. My lips are sealed.
Finished.
Is that you, Inspector?
Yes, excuse me.
Going out?
Yes, I don't feel so well.
Strange, me neither.
Tummy upset?
Headache.
Mine's a tummy upset.
We can go out together.
Looking for something?
Your revolver perhaps?
I just borrowed it.
You go first.
I think I'll stay in.
What about your headache?
It's gone.
Well, my tummy is still upset.
You go first.
Where are you going?
For a walk.
You'll be back for my song?
I hope so.
Nice weather, isn't it?
Wonderful.
Feels good to be alive.
Make the most of it.
You're cheerful.
Indeed.
One last warning.
We might meet people, cops even.
One word out of you and I'll shoot.
You'll miss.
At point-blank range?
You never know, you might sneeze.
You're an optimist.
By nature. Patient but optimistic.
Anyway, you wouldn't dare shoot. You'd get caught.
Do you think so? I run fast.
And as you know, I have two witnesses to swear an alibi.
Get up!
I can't. I'm hurt.
Have you broken anything?
Stop clowning around!
He looks hurt.
It's a drunken game he's been playing.
You could say that.
I'll help you.
Someone's calling you, driver.
Are you sure...
Take me with you.
No, I'll take care of him.
Square Rigier!
But that's near here.
I'm a doctor.
It's an emergency.
Foiled!
Next time I'll shoot.
Perfectly natural.
Where are we going?
Nearby. I'd slow down if I were you.
Am I a condemned man?
You played and lost.
No game is lost until it's won.
I wouldn't swap my cards for yours.
I'll bet you 1,000 to one I get away.
Is it a deal?
Here's a cop.
Look straight ahead.
Watch what you're doing!
Sorry, officer, he's a bit drunk.
He's getting married. This is his stag do.
I guess you didn't see me. - I saw you.
That's how I got my aim right.
He told me to do it because he hates cops.
He bet I wouldn't spit on your boots.
You're coming with me!
He's just kidding.
Come with me, both of you!
Help! Help!
Stay here!
We'll be waiting.
What is it?
What's wrong?
A round of applause for our three friends, recently cleared of all suspicion.
Where could Wens be?
He left with Lalah-Poor. - They'll be back soon.
Unless they meet Durand.
Now I shall hand you over to our charming star, Mila Malou.
I Know You're Lying".
I know very well You 're lying
But I come Timidly
Each time I surrender
To your words, soft and tender
And no matter how much I blame myself
It is wrong To love you
I know very well You 're lying
But I come Timidly
Each time I surrender
To your words, soft and tender...
What is it? Are you ill?
They've killed him. I'm sure of it.
Who?
Don't you see?
Colin, Lalah-Poor and the Doctor are three Durands! Three!
Come in, we're here.
Nice place, isn't it?
Lovely.
Cheerful too.
You've already killed someone in a builder's yard.
That's true.
I did kill one of those lowlifes in a builder's yard.
Poor fellow.
Don't feel sorry for him.
At least they found his body.
There'll be no trace of you. Look!
It's quicklime.
Yes.
No wonder you're a detective. You have a good eye.
Looking at the time?
Yes.
Expecting help?
No, just making a calculation.
It takes five minutes to walk back and your act starts in 15.
That leaves you ten minutes to chat.
Unfortunately for you, we have nothing to say.
Then why bring me here?
To facilitate your disappearance.
Ah, you're going to conjure me away.
This is no joke.
I really can't complain.
I would have hated to die, shot by some petty crook.
But there's no shame in losing to brilliant adversaries, to masterminds.
Thanks.
You're too kind.
No, I mean it. You've astonished me.
What's that?
A shoelace.
It also serves as a noose.
By using a single pseudonym for your crimes, you've created a lethal trinity.
That is genius.
You're exaggerating.
Not at all.
If I had more time...
You've got three minutes.
Go on.
In truth, you're not criminals.
You're artists in crime.
It's a pity your masterpiece will remain unknown.
I shall be your first... and last admirer.
We're sorry to see you go.
Alas.
All we can offer you is your choice of death.
How kind.
If you want the sword... the pistol... or strangulation, just say the word.
You couldn't be more kind.
I shall take advantage of the offer.
Of you three, there is one who has my deepest admiration.
The one who had the inspiration for this association.
I want to die by his hand. - Me!
Me!
You?
What?
That's a good one!
How dare you?
Come now, gentlemen.
Let us speak.
Just a minute.
After me.
Why after you?
I'll set the record straight.
No, we'll set it straight.
This story goes back some 40 years to a classroom in an elementary school.
We were three young hooligans.
But one of us was by far the worst.
His name was Theodore Linz.
Thank you.
I'll give you credit for that.
You were the nastiest little beast imaginable.
Every day he would pee in the supervisor's inkwell.
Naturally, the headmaster suspected him and Theodore was expelled.
The next day, to clear his name,
I got the idea to do the same thing in the same circumstances.
Linz was reinstated two days later.
I came up with the mechanism for our future exploits.
You're right, Colin. Here is my neck.
No, you can't claim the honour. You merely stumbled on the idea.
The true inventor is the one who developed the theory in practice.
That was me and I don't think anyone will deny that.
Forgive me, Doctor, I await your sword.
Hang on a minute.
The Inspector said the pseudonym was the thing.
Durand was my idea.
I am Mr Durand.
So it would seem.
It's difficult.
A moral dilemma.
May I?
Well?
There is one solution which would win my vote.
To be killed by none of you and to arrest all three of you.
That's a good one!
Arrest us?
How?
Like this.
You lost our bet, Professor.
Pay up and I'll tell you the story of Tom Thumb.
Love is a song that never ends
Life may be swift and fleeting
Hope may die Yet love's beautiful music
Comes each day like the dawn
Love is a song that never ends
One simple theme repeating
Like the voice of a heavenly choir
Love's sweet music flows on
Like the voice of a heavenly choir
Love's sweet music flows on
Wake up.
What now?
Wake up, Friend Owl.
What's going on around here?
Wake up.
It's happened.
The new prince is born.
We're going to see him.
Come on. You better hurry up.
Well, look.
Well.
Isn't he cute?
Well, this is quite an occasion.
Yes, sir, it isn't every day a prince is born.
You're to be congratulated.
Yes, congratulations.
Congratulations.
Thank you very much.
Come on. Wake up. We have company.
Hello. Hello, there.
Hello, little prince. - Hello.
Hello, there.
Hello, little prince.
Look. He's trying to get up.
Kinda wobbly, isn't he?
Thumper.
Well, he is.
Aren't you?
Looks to me like he's getting kind of sleepy.
I think it's time we all left.
Come on.
Thumper. Come on.
Whatcha gonna call him?
Well, I think I'll call him Bambi.
Yep, I guess that'll do all right.
My little Bambi.
Walking already. Well, what do you know.
Good morning.
Good morning, Mrs Quail.
And where's the young prince this...
Good morning, Bambi.
Good morning, young prince.
Goodbye.
Good morning, young prince.
Good morning, young prince.
Good morning.
Nice sunny day.
What's the matter?
What happened?
Did the young prince fall down?
Is he hurt?
No, he's all right.
He doesn't walk very good, does he?
Thumper.
Yes, Mama?
What did your father tell you this morning?
If you can't say something nice,
don't say nothing at all.
Come on, Bambi, get up. Try again.
Come on, get up. Get up.
Get up.
Try again.
I'm thumping. That's why they call me Thumper.
Thumper!
Come on. You can do it.
Hop over it. Like this.
Hop over it.
Like this.
You didn't hop far enough.
That's it. Now the other one.
Gee whiz, what happened that time?
Those are birds.
Look, he's trying to talk.
He's trying to say "bird".
Say "bird".
Bird.
Bird.
Come on, say "bird", say "bird".
Say "bird". Say "bird". Come on, say "bird".
Say "bird".
Bird.
He talked. He talked, Mama.
The young prince said "bird".
Bird, bird, bird...
Bird.
No, that's not a bird.
That's a butterfly.
Butterfly?
Butter...
Butterfly.
No, that's a flower.
Flower?
It's pretty.
Pretty.
Flower.
Me?
That's not a flower.
He's a little...
That's all right.
He can call me a flower if he wants to.
I don't mind.
Pretty. Pretty flower.
Gosh.
I think I better go home now.
Drip, drip, drop Little April shower

Mother, what we going to do today?
I'm going to take you to the meadow.
Meadow?
What's the meadow?
It's a very wonderful place.
Then why haven't we been there before?
You weren't big enough.
Mother, you know what?
What?
We're not the only deer in the forest.
Where did you hear that?
Thumper told me.
Well, he's right.
There are many deer in the forest besides us.
Then why don't I ever see them?
You will, sometime.
On the meadow?
Perhaps.
Hush now.
We're almost there.
The meadow.
Wait.
Bambi, wait.
You must never rush out on the meadow.
There might be danger.
Out there, we're unprotected.
The meadow is wide and open, and there are no trees or bushes to hide us.
So we have to be very careful.
Wait here.
I'll go out first. And if the meadow is safe, I'll call you.
Come on, Bambi. It's all right.
Come on.
Good morning, Prince Bambi.
Good morning, young prince.
Hello. What ya eating'?
Clover.
It's awfully good.
It's delicious.
Why don't you try some?
No, not that green stuff.
Just eat the blossoms.
That's the good stuff.
Thumper.
Yes, Mama?
What did your father tell you?
About what?
About eating the blossoms and leaving the greens?
Oh, that one.
Eating greens is a special treat.
It makes long ears and great big feet.
But it sure is awful stuff to eat.
I made that last part up myself.
Watch out.
That's little Faline.
He's kind of bashful, isn't he, Mama?
Well, maybe he wouldn't be if you'd say hello.
Hello, Bambi.
I said hello.
Well, aren't you going to answer her?
You're not afraid, are you?
Well, then, go ahead.
Go on, say hello.
Hello.
You.
He stopped and looked at me.
Yes, I know.
Why was everyone still when he came on the meadow?
Everyone respects him.
For of all the deer in the forest, not one has lived half so long.
He's very brave and very wise.
That's why he's known as the Great Prince of the Forest.
Faline.
Bambi.
Mother.
Bambi.
Mother.
Come on out, Bambi.
Come on.
It's safe now.
We don't have to hide any longer.
What happened, Mother?
Why did we all run?
Man was in the forest.
Mother, look. What's all that white stuff?
Why, it's snow.
Snow?
Yes.
Winter has come.
Hiya, Bambi.
Watch what I can do.
Come on. It's all right.
Look.
The water's stiff.
Some fun, huh, Bambi?
Come on, get up. Like this.
Kinda wobbly, aren't you?
Got to watch both ends at the same time.
Guess you better unwind it.
Wake up. Wake up, Flower.
Is it spring yet?
No. Winter's just started.
What you doing?
Hibernating?
What do you want to do that for?
All us flowers sleep in the winter.
Well, good night.
Winter sure is long, isn't it?
It seems long.
But it won't last forever.
I'm awful hungry, Mother.
Yes, I know.
Bambi, come here.
Look.
New spring grass.
Bambi. Quick.
The thicket.
Faster.
Faster, Bambi.
Don't look back. Keep running.
Keep running.
We made it.
We made it, Mother.
We...
Mother.
Mother, where are you?
Your mother can't be with you anymore.
Come.
My son.
Let's sing a gay little spring song
This is the season to sing
So I'd like to suggest That we all do our best
And warble a song about spring
Spring, spring, spring
Let's get together and sing
Let's sing a gay little spring song
Just like bird on the wing
Things always seem right When you're cheerful and bright
So let's get together and sing
Sing, sing, sing
Let's sing a song about spring
Let's twitter and tweet Like the birdies in May
Get into the mood And be merry today
Forget all your troubles And warble away...
Wait.
What now?
Hey.
Stop that racket.
Scat.
Let's sing a song about spring
I'll fix 'em.
There. I guess that'll teach 'em.
Oh, what's the use?
This is the season to sing...
Same thing every spring.
Love's sweet song.
Pain in the pin feathers, I call it.
Stop it.
Get out of here. All of you.
And you, too.
Hello, Friend Owl. Don't you remember me?
Why, it's the young prince.
Bambi!
My, my, how you've changed.
Turn round there. Let me look at you.
I see you've traded in your spots for a pair of antlers.
You know, just the other day I was talking to myself about you.
And we were wondering what had become of you.
Hello, Bambi.
Remember me?
Thumper.
Right.
Hi, fellas.
Flower.
Yeah.
Well, what's the matter with them?
Why are they acting that way?
Why, don't you know?
They're "twitterpated".
Twitterpated?
Yes. Nearly everybody gets twitterpated in the spring time. Yes.
For example, you're walking along, minding your own business, you're looking neither to the left nor to the right, when all of a sudden you run smack into a pretty face.
You begin to get weak in the knees.
Your head's in a whirl.
And then you feel light as a feather.
And before you know it, you're walking on air.
And then you know what?
You're knocked for a loop.
And you completely lose your head.
Gosh, that's awful.
Gee whiz.
Terrible.
And that ain't all.
It can happen to anybody.
So you'd better be careful.
It could happen to you, and you, and...
Yes, it could even happen to you.
Well, it's not going to happen to me.
Me neither.
Me neither.
Twitterpated.
Hello, Bambi.
Don't you remember me?
I'm Faline.
Bambi.
I bring you a song
And I sing as I go
For I want you to know
That I'm looking for romance
I bring you a song
In the hope that you'll see
When you're looking at me
That I'm looking for love
I'm seeking that glow
Only found when you're young and it's May
Only found on that wonderful day
When all longing is through
I'm seeking that glow
Only found when a thrill is complete
Only found when two hearts gently beat
To the strains of a waltz That's both tender and new
I bring you a song
For I'm seeking romance
You're by my side There's a moon up above
It shines with a light That's so mellow and bright
It's easy to see That tonight we shall fall in love
I bring you a song
For I'm seeking romance
And you
It is Man.
He is here again.
There are many this time.
We must go deep into the forest.
Hurry. Follow me.
Faline.
Bambi, where are you?
Faline.
Listen.
He's coming.
Hush.
Be quiet.
He's coming closer.
Be calm. Don't get excited.
We better fly. - No.
No, don't fly.
Whatever you do, don't fly.
He's almost here. I can't stand it any longer.
Bambi.
Faline.
Quick, Faline. Jump.
Get up, Bambi.
Get up.
You must get up.
Get up.
Get up.
Now, come with me.
Bambi.
Wake up. Wake up, Friend Owl.
Wake up, Friend Owl.
What now?
Hey, what's going on around here?
It's happened.
Happened?
Yes. In the thicket.
Hurry up, Bambi.
Yes, Papa. I'm coming.
Oh. Well.
Look.
Two of them.
Well, I don't believe I've ever seen a more likely looking pair of fawns.
Prince Bambi ought to be mighty proud.
Love is a song that never ends
One simple theme repeating
Like the voice
Of a heavenly choir
Love's sweet music
Flows on
With the coming of the Second World War many eyes in imprisoned Europe turned hopefully, or desperately toward the freedom of the Americas.
Lisbon became the great embarkation point.
But not everybody could get to Lisbon directly.
And so a torturous, roundabout refugee trail sprang up.
Paris to Marseilles across the Mediterranean to Oran.
Then, by train or auto or foot, across the rim of Africa to Casablanca in French Morocco.
Here, the fortunate ones, through money or influence or luck might obtain exit visas and scurry to Lisbon.
And from Lisbon to the New World.
But the others wait in Casablanca.
And wait and wait and wait.
To all officers:
Two German couriers carrying official documents murdered on train from Oran.
Murderer and possible accomplices headed for Casablanca.
Round up all suspicious characters and search them for stolen document.
Important.
May we see your papers?
I don't think I have them on me.
In that case, you'll have to come along.
It's possible that I... Yes. Here they are.
These papers expired three weeks ago. You'll have to come along.
Halt! Halt!
What on earth is going on there?
I don't know, my dear.
Pardon, monsieur. Pardon, madame. Have you not heard?
We hear very little, and we understand even less.
Two German couriers were found murdered in the desert. The unoccupied desert.
This is the customary roundup of refugees, liberals and, of course, a beautiful young girl for Renault, the prefect of police.
Along with these unhappy refugees, the scum of Europe has gravitated to Casablanca.
Some of them have been waiting years for a visa.
I beg of you, monsieur, watch yourself. Be on guard.
This place is full of vultures.
Vultures everywhere. Everywhere!
Thank you.
Thank you very much. - Not at all.
What an amusing little fellow.
Waiter.
Oh, how silly of me.
What, dear?
I've left my wallet in the hotel.
Perhaps tomorrow we'll be on the plane.
It is good to see you again, Major Strasser.
Thank you, thank you.
May I present Captain Renault, police prefect of Casablanca.
Unoccupied France welcomes you to Casablanca.
Thank you, captain. It's good to be here.
Major Strasser, my aide, Lieutenant Casselle.
Captain Tonnelli. The Italian service at your command.
That is kind of you.
You may find the climate of Casablanca a trifle warm.
We Germans must get used to all climates, from Russia to the Sahara.
Perhaps you weren't referring to weather.
What else?
The murder of the couriers. What has been done?
My men are rounding up twice the usual number of suspects.
But we know already who the murderer is.
Good. Is he in custody?
No hurry. Tonight he'll be at Rick's. Everybody comes to Rick's.
I've already heard about this café. And also about Mr. Rick himself.
Waiting, waiting, waiting.
I'll never get out of here.
I'll die in Casablanca.
But can't you make it just a little more? Please?
Sorry, but diamonds are a drug on the market. Everybody sells diamonds.
There are diamonds everywhere. 2400.
All right.
The trucks are waiting. The men are waiting. Everything--
It's the fishing smack Santiago.
It leaves at 1 tomorrow night, here from the end of La Medina.
Third boat.
Thank you.
Thank you. - And bring 15,000 francs in cash.
Remember, in cash.
Open up, Abdul.
Yes, professor.
Waiter?
Yes, madame?
Will you ask Rick if he'll have a drink with us?
Madame, he never drinks with customers. Never. I have never seen it.
What makes saloonkeepers so snobbish?
Perhaps if you told him I ran the second-largest banking house in Amsterdam.
Second largest?
That wouldn't impress Rick.
The leading banker in Amsterdam is now the pastry chef in our kitchen.
We have something to look forward to.
And his father is the bellboy.
Excuse me.
I'm sorry, sir. This is a private room.
Of all the nerve.
Who do you think--? I know there is gambling in there.
You dare not keep me out.
Yes? What's the trouble?
I have been in every gambling room between Honolulu and Berlin.
And if you think I'm going to be kept out of a saloon like this, you're much mistaken.
Excuse me, please.
Your cash is good at the bar.
What?
Do you know who I am?
I do. You're lucky the bar is open to you.
This is outrageous! I shall report it to The Angriff.
You know, watching you just now, one would think you've been doing this all your life.
What makes you think I haven't?
Nothing.
But when you first came, I thought--
You thought what?
What right do I have to think?
May I?
Too bad about those two German couriers, wasn't it?
They got a lucky break.
Yesterday they were just clerks today they are the honored dead.
You are a very cynical person, Rick, if you'll forgive me for saying so.
I forgive you.
Will you have a drink with me?
I forgot, you never drink with-- I'll have another, please.
You despise me, don't you?
If I gave you any thought, I probably would.
But why?
Do you object to the kind of business I do?
But think of all those poor refugees who must rot in this place if I didn't help them.
That's not so bad. Through ways of my own, I provide them with exit visas.
For a price, Ugarte. For a price.
But think of all the poor devils who can't meet Renault's price.
I get it for them for half. Is that so parasitic?
I don't mind a parasite.
Well, after tonight I will be through with the whole business.
And I'm leaving, finally, this Casablanca.
Who did you bribe for your visa?
Renault or yourself?
Myself. I found myself much more reasonable.
Look, Rick.
Know what this is?
Something that even you have never seen.
Letters of transit signed by General de Gaulle.
Cannot be rescinded. Not even questioned.
One moment.
Tonight I'll be selling those for more money than I ever dreamed of.
And then, addio, Casablanca.
I have many a friend in Casablanca, but somehow, just because you despise me you are the only one I trust.
Will you keep these for me, please?
For how long? - Perhaps an hour.
Perhaps a little longer.
I don't want them here overnight.
Don't be afraid of that.
Please keep them for me.
Thank you. I knew I could trust you.
Waiter. I'll be expecting some people.
If anybody asks for me, I'll be right here.
Rick I hope you're more impressed with me now.
If you'll forgive me, I'll share my good luck with your roulette wheel.
Just a moment.
I heard a rumor those two German couriers were carrying letters of transit.
I've heard that rumor too.
Poor devils.
You're right, Ugarte.
I am a little more impressed with you.
Hello, Rick. - Hello, Ferrari.
How's business at the Blue Parrot?
Fine, but I'd like to buy your café.
It's not for sale.
You haven't heard my offer.
It's not for sale at any price.
What do you want for Sam?
I don't buy or sell human beings.
Too bad. That's Casablanca's leading commodity.
In refugees alone we could make a fortune, if you'd work with me in the black market.
Suppose you run your business and let me run mine.
Suppose we ask Sam. Maybe he'd like to make a change.
Suppose we do.
When will you realize that in this world today isolationism is no longer a practical policy?
Sam, Ferrari wants you to work for him at the Blue Parrot.
Oh, I like it fine here.
He'll double what I pay you.
I ain't got time to spend what I make here.
Sorry.
The boss's private stock...
...because, Yvonne, I love you.
Oh, shut up.
All right, all right. For you, I shut up, because, Yvonne, I love you.
Some Germans gave this check. Is it all right?
Where were you last night?
That's so long ago, I don't remember.
Will I see you tonight?
I never make plans that far ahead.
Give me another.
Sascha, she's had enough.
Don't listen to him. Fill it up.
Yvonne, I love you, but he pays me.
Rick, I'm tired of having you--
Sascha, call a cab.
We're gonna get your coat.
Take your hands off me.
You're going home. You've had a little too much to drink.
Hey, taxi.
Who do you think you are, pushing me around?
I was a fool to fall for a man like you.
Go with her, Sascha. Be sure she gets home.
And come right back.
Yes, boss.
Hello, Rick.
Hello, Louis.
How extravagant you are, throwing away women.
Someday they may be scarce.
I think now I shall pay a call on Yvonne.
Maybe get her on the rebound.
When it comes to women, you're a true democrat.
If he gets a word in, it'll be a major Italian victory.
The plane to Lisbon.
You would like to be on it?
Why? What's in Lisbon?
The clipper to America.
I've often speculated on why you don't return to America.
Did you abscond with the church funds?
Did you run off with a senator's wife?
I like to think you killed a man. It's the romantic in me.
It's a combination of all three.
And what in heaven's name brought you to Casablanca?
My health. I came to Casablanca for the waters.
The waters?
What waters? We're in the desert.
I was misinformed.
Excuse me, Monsieur Rick.
A gentleman inside has won 20,000 francs and the cashier would like some money.
I'll get it from the safe.
I'm so upset, Rick. You know I--
Forget it, Emil. Mistakes like that happen all the time.
I'm awfully sorry.
Rick, there will be some excitement here tonight. An arrest in your café.
Again?
This is no ordinary arrest.
A murderer, no less.
If you're thinking of warning him, don't put yourself out. He cannot escape.
I stick my neck out for nobody.
A wise foreign policy.
Could have made the arrest earlier, at the Blue Parrot.
Out of my regard for you, we're staging it here.
It will amuse your customers.
Our entertainment's enough.
We're to have an important guest here tonight.
Major Strasser of the Third Reich, no less.
We want him to be here when we make the arrest.
A demonstration of the efficiency of my administration.
I see. And what's Strasser doing here?
He certainly didn't come here to witness a demonstration of your efficiency.
Perhaps not.
It shall not happen again.
That's all right.
Louis, you got something on your mind. Why don't you spill it.
How observant you are.
As a matter of fact, I wanted to give you a word of advice.
Yeah?
Have a brandy?
Thank you.
There are many exit visas sold in this café, but we know that you've never sold one.
That is the reason we permit you to remain open.
I thought it was because I let you win at roulette.
That is another reason.
There is a man arrived in Casablanca on his way to America.
He will offer a fortune to anyone who'll furnish an exit visa.
What's his name?
Victor Laszlo.
Victor Laszlo?
Rick, that is the first time I've seen you so impressed.
He's succeeded in impressing half the world.
It's my duty to see that he doesn't impress the other half.
Laszlo must never reach America. He stays in Casablanca.
It'll be interesting to see how he manages.
Manages what?
His escape.
But I just told you--
Stop it.
He escaped from a concentration camp. The Nazis have chased him all over Europe.
This is the end of the chase.
Twenty thousand francs says it isn't.
Is that a serious offer?
I just paid out 20, and I'd like to get it back.
Make it 10. I'm only a poor corrupt official.
Okay. - Done.
No matter how clever he is, he still needs an exit visa. Or I should say two.
Why two?
He is traveling with a lady.
He'll take one. - I think not.
I've seen the lady.
And if he did not leave her in Marseilles or Oran he certainly won't leave her in Casablanca.
Maybe he's not quite as romantic as you are.
It doesn't matter. There is no exit visa for him.
What ever gave you the impression that I might help Laszlo escape?
Because, my dear Ricky, I suspect that under that cynical shell you are at heart a sentimentalist.
Laugh if you will, but I happen to be familiar with your record.
Let me point out just two items:
In 1935, you ran guns to Ethiopia.
In 1936, you fought in Spain on the Loyalist side.
And got well paid for it on both occasions.
The winning side would have paid you much better.
Maybe.
It seems you're determined to keep Laszlo here.
I have my orders.
I see. Gestapo spank.
My dear Ricky, you overestimate the influence of the Gestapo.
I don't interfere with them, and they don't interfere with me.
In Casablanca, I am master of my fate.
I am--
Major Strasser is here, sir.
You were saying? - Excuse me.
Carl, see that Major Strasser gets a good table, close to the ladies.
I have already given him the best, knowing he is German and would take it anyway.
Take him quietly. Two guards at every door.
Everything is ready, sir. - Go ahead.
Good evening, gentlemen.
Good evening, captain.
Won't you join us?
Thank you.
It's a pleasure to have you here, major.
Champagne and a tin of caviar.
May I recommend Veuve Clicquot '26, a good French wine.
A very interesting club.
Especially so tonight, major.
In a few minutes you'll see the arrest of the man who murdered your couriers.
I expected no less, captain.
Monsieur Ugarte.
Will you please come with us?
Certainly.
May I first please cash my chips?
Very lucky, huh? Two thousand, please.
Rick, help me!
Don't be a fool.
You can't get away. - But, Rick, hide me. Do something!
Excellent, captain.
When they come for me, I hope you'll be more of a help.
I stick my neck out for nobody.
I'm sorry there was a disturbance, folks, but it's all over now.
Just sit down and have a good time. Enjoy yourselves.
All right, Sam.
Rick, this is Major Heinrich Strasser of the Third Reich.
How do you do, Mr. Rick?
How do you do?
You already know Herr Heinze of the Third Reich.
Please join us, Mr. Rick.
We are very honored tonight.
Major Strasser is one of the reasons the Third Reich enjoys the reputation it has.
You repeat Third Reich as though you expected there to be others.
Well, personally, major, I will take what comes.
Do you mind if I ask you a few questions?
Unofficially, of course.
Make it official if you like.
What is your nationality?
I'm a drunkard.
And that makes Rick a citizen of the world.
I was born in New York City, if that'll help you any.
I understand you came here from Paris at the time of the occupation.
There seems to be no secret about that.
Are you one of those people who cannot imagine the Germans in their beloved Paris?
It's not particularly my beloved Paris.
Can you imagine us in London?
When you get there, ask me.
Diplomatist.
How about New York?
Well, there are sections of New York, major, that I wouldn't advise you to try to invade.
Who do you think will win the war?
I haven't the slightest idea.
Rick is completely neutral about everything.
And that takes in the field of women too.
You were not always so carefully neutral. We have a complete dossier on you.
Richard Blaine, American. Age: 37. Cannot return to his country."
The reason is a little vague. We also know what you did in Paris.
And also we know why you left Paris. Don't worry, we're not going to broadcast it.
Are my eyes really brown?
You will forgive my curiosity, Mr. Blaine.
The point is an enemy of the Reich has come to Casablanca and we are checking up on anybody who can be of any help to us.
My interest in whether Victor Laszlo stays or goes is purely a sporting one.
In this case you have no sympathy for the fox?
Not particularly. I understand the point of view of the hound too.
Laszlo published the foulest lies in the Prague newspapers until the day we marched in.
And even after that, he continued to print scandal sheets in his cellar.
Of course, one must admit he has great courage.
I admit he's clever. Three times he slipped through our fingers.
In Paris he continued his activities.
We intend not to let it happen again.
Excuse me, gentlemen. Your business is politics, mine is running a saloon.
Good evening, Mr. Blaine.
You see, major? You have nothing to worry about Rick.
Perhaps.
I reserved a table. Victor Laszlo.
Yes, Monsieur Laszlo. Right this way.
Two Cointreaux, please.
I saw no one of Ugarte's description.
Victor, I feel somehow we shouldn't stay here.
If we would walk out so soon it would only call attention to us.
Perhaps Ugarte is in some other part of the café.
Excuse me, but you look like a couple who are on their way to America.
You'll find a market there for this ring. I'm forced to sell it at a great sacrifice.
Thank you, but I hardly think...
Perhaps for the lady.
The ring is quite unique.
Yes, I'm very interested.
Good.
What is your name?
Berger, Norwegian. At your service, sir.
I'll meet you in a few minutes at the bar.
We don't want the ring, but thanks for showing it to us.
Such a bargain. But that is your decision?
I'm sorry, it is.
Monsieur Laszlo, is it not? - Yes?
I am Captain Renault, prefect of police.
Yes, what is it you want?
Merely to welcome you to Casablanca and wish you a pleasant stay.
It isn't often we have so distinguished a visitor.
Thank you. I hope you'll forgive me, captain.
The present French administration hasn't always been so cordial.
May I present Miss Ilsa Lund.
I was told you were the most beautiful woman ever to visit Casablanca.
That was a gross understatement.
You're very kind.
Won't you join us?
If you will permit me.
Oh, no, Emile, please. A bottle of your best champagne.
And put it on my bill.
It's a game we play. They put it on the bill, I tear up the bill. It is very convenient.
Captain, the boy who's playing the piano...
Somewhere I've seen him.
Sam?
Yes.
He came from Paris with Rick.
Rick? Who is he?
Mademoiselle, you are in Rick's. Rick is...
Is what?
Mademoiselle, he's the kind of man that, well, if I were a woman and I were not around, I should be in love with Rick.
But what a fool I am talking to a beautiful woman about another man.
Excuse me.
Major.
Mademoiselle Lund and Monsieur Laszlo, may I present Major Strasser.
How do you do?
This is a pleasure I have looked forward to.
I'm sure you'll excuse me if I'm not gracious.
You see, Major Strasser, I am a Czechoslovakian.
You were a Czechoslovakian. Now you are a subject of the German Reich.
I have never accepted that privilege. And I'm now on French soil.
I should like to discuss some matters arising from your presence on French soil.
This is hardly the time or place.
Then we shall state another time and place. Tomorrow at 10 in the prefect's office.
With mademoiselle.
Captain, I am under your authority.
Is it your order that we come to your office?
Let us say it is my request. That is a much more pleasant word.
Very well.
A very clever tactical retreat, major.
This time they really mean to stop me.
Victor, I'm afraid for you.
We've been in difficult places before, haven't we?
I must find out what Berger knows.
Be careful. - I will.
Don't worry.
Monsieur Berger, the ring. Could I see it again?
Champagne cocktail, please.
I recognize you from the news photographs, Monsieur Laszlo.
In a concentration camp, one is apt to lose a little weight.
We read five times that you were killed in five different places.
As you see, it was true every single time.
Thank heaven I found you, Berger.
I'm looking for a man by the name of Ugarte. He's supposed to help me.
Ugarte cannot even help himself.
He's under arrest for murder.
He was arrested here tonight.
I see.
But we who are still free will do all we can. We are organized.
Underground, like everywhere else.
Tomorrow night there is a meeting at the Caverne du Bois.
If you will come--
Will you ask the piano player to come over here?
Very well, mademoiselle.
How's the jewelry business, Berger?
Not so good. Check, please.
Too bad you weren't here earlier. We had quite a bit of excitement, didn't we, Berger?
Yes. Excuse me, gentlemen.
My bill. - No.
Two champagne cocktails. Please.
Hello, Sam.
Hello, Miss Ilsa.
I never expected to see you again.
It's been a long time.
Yes, ma'am. A lot of water under the bridge.
Some of the old songs, Sam.
Yes, ma'am.
Where is Rick?
I don't know. I ain't seen him all night.
When will he be back?
Not tonight no more. He ain't coming--
Does he always leave so early?
He never-- Well, he's got a girl up to the Blue Parrot.
Goes up there all the time.
You used to be a much better liar, Sam.
Leave him alone, Miss Ilsa. You're bad luck to him.
Play it once, Sam. For old times' sake.
I don't know what you mean, Miss Ilsa.
Play it, Sam.
Play "As Time Goes By."
I can't remember it, Miss Ilsa. I'm a little rusty on it.
I'll hum it for you.
Sing it, Sam.
Sam, I thought I told you never to play--
Well, you were asking about Rick, and here he is. May I present--
Hello, Ilsa.
Hello, Rick.
Oh, you've already met Rick, mademoiselle? Then perhaps you also--
This is Mr. Laszlo.
How do you do?
How do you do?
One hears a great deal about Rick in Casablanca.
And about Victor Laszlo everywhere.
Won't you join us for a drink?
Rick never--
Thanks, I will.
Well a precedent is being broken. Emile.
Interesting café. I congratulate you.
I congratulate you.
What for?
Your work.
Thank you. I try.
We all try. You succeed.
She was asking about you earlier, Rick, in a way that made me extremely jealous.
I wasn't sure you were the same.
Let's see, the last time we met--
Was La Belle Aurore.
How nice. You remembered.
But, of course, that was the day the Germans marched into Paris.
Not an easy day to forget.
I remember every detail. The Germans wore gray, you wore blue.
Yes. I put that dress away.
When the Germans march out I'll wear it again.
Ricky, you're becoming quite human. I suppose we have to thank you for that.
Ilsa, I don't wish to be the one to say it, but it's late.
So it is. We have a curfew in Casablanca.
It would never do for the chief of police to be found drinking after hours.
I hope we didn't overstay our welcome.
Not at all.
Your check, sir.
It's my party.
Another precedent gone. This has been a very interesting evening.
I'll call you a cab.
Gasoline rationing, time of night.
We'll come again.
Anytime.
Say good night to Sam for me.
I will.
There's still nobody in the world who can play "As Time Goes By" like Sam.
He hasn't played it in a long time.
Good night.
Good night.
Night.
A very puzzling fellow, this Rick. What sort is he?
I really can't say, though I saw him quite often in Paris.
Tomorrow at 10, at the prefect office.
We'll be there.
Good night.
Boss?
Boss?
Yeah?
Boss, ain't you going to bed?
Not right now.
Ain't you planning on going to bed in the near future?
You ever going to bed?
No.
Well, I ain't sleepy, either.
Good, then have a drink.
Not me, boss.
Then don't have a drink.
Boss, let's get out of here.
No, sir. I'm waiting for a lady.
Please, let's go. Ain't nothing but trouble for you here.
She's coming back. I know she's coming back.
We'll take the car and drive all night.
We'll get drunk. We'll go fishing, stay away until she's gone.
Shut up and go home, will you?
No, sir, I'm staying right here.
They grab Ugarte, then she walks in.
That's the way it goes. One in, one out.
Sam.
Yes, boss?
If it's December 1941 in Casablanca, what time is it in New York?
What?
My watch stopped.
I bet they're asleep in New York.
I bet they're asleep all over America.
Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world she walks into mine.
What's that you're playing?
A little something of my own.
Well, stop it. You know what I want to hear.
No, I don't.
You played it for her. You can play it for me.
I don't think I can remember--
If she can stand it, I can.
Play it.
Yes, boss.
Who are you really? And what were you before?
What did you do, and what did you think?
We said no questions.
Here's looking at you, kid.
A franc for your thoughts.
In America they'd bring only a penny.
I guess that's about all they're worth.
I'm willing to be overcharged.
Tell me.
Well, I was wondering...
Why I'm so lucky. Why I should find you waiting for me to come along.
Why there is no other man in my life?
That's easy. There was.
He's dead.
I'm sorry for asking.
I forgot we said no questions.
Only one answer can take care of all our questions.
Nothing can stop them now. Wednesday, Thursday at the latest, they'll be in Paris.
Richard, they'll find out your record. You won't be safe here.
I'm on their blacklist already. Their roll of honor.
Henri wants us to finish this bottle and then three more.
Says he'll water his garden with champagne before he'll let the Germans drink it.
This sort of takes the sting out of being occupied, doesn't it?
You said it.
Here's looking at you, kid.
My German's a little rusty.
It's the Gestapo.
They say they expect to be in Paris tomorrow.
They're telling us how to act when they come marching in.
With the whole world crumbling, we pick this time to fall in love.
It's pretty bad timing.
Where were you, say, 10 years ago?
10 years ago?
Let's see.
Yes, I was having a brace put on my teeth. Where were you?
Looking for a job.
Was that cannon fire?
Or is it my heart pounding?
It's the new German 77th, and judging by the sound, only about 35 miles away.
And getting closer every minute.
Here, here, drink up.
We'll never finish the other three.
Them Germans will be here pretty soon, and they'll come looking for you.
And don't forget, there's a price on your head.
I left a note in my apartment. They'll know where to find me.
It's strange.
I know so very little about you.
I know very little about you.
Just the fact that you had your teeth straightened.
Be serious, darling. You are in danger. You must leave Paris.
No, we must leave.
Yes, of course. We.
The train for Marseilles leaves at 5:00. I'll pick you up at your hotel at 4:30.
Not at my hotel. I...
I have things to do in the city before I leave.
I'll meet you at the station.
All right, at a quarter to 5.
Why don't we get married in Marseilles?
That's too far ahead to plan.
Yes. I guess it is too far ahead.
Let's see... What about the engineer?
Why can't he marry us on the train?
Why not? The captain on a ship can.
It doesn't seem fair that--
Hey, what's wrong, kid?
I love you so much.
And I hate this war so much.
It's a crazy world. Anything can happen.
If you shouldn't get away...
If something should keep us apart wherever they put you and wherever I'll be, I want you to know that I...
Kiss me.
Kiss me as if it were the last time.
Where is she?
Have you seen her?
I can't find her. She checked out of the hotel.
But this note came just after you left.
That's the last call, Mr. Richard.
Do you hear me?
Come on, Mr. Richard. Let's get out of here. Come on.
Rick, I have to talk to you.
I saved my first drink to have with you. Here.
No, Rick. Not tonight.
Especially tonight.
Why did you have to come to Casablanca? There are other places.
I wouldn't have come if I'd known you were here.
Believe me, Rick, it's true. I didn't know.
It's funny about your voice, how it hasn't changed.
Richard, dear, I'll go with you anyplace.
We'll get on a train and never stop."
Don't, Rick.
I can understand how you feel.
You understand how I feel.
How long was it we had, honey?
I didn't count the days.
Well, I did.
Every one of them.
Mostly I remember the last one.
The wild finish.
A guy standing on a station platform in the rain with a comical look on his face because his insides have been kicked out.
Can I tell you a story, Rick?
Does it got a wild finish?
I don't know the finish yet.
Go on, tell it. Maybe one'll come to you as you go along.
It's about a girl who had just come to Paris from her home in Oslo.
At the house of some friends she met a man about whom she'd heard her whole life.
A very great and courageous man.
He opened up for her a whole beautiful world full of knowledge and thoughts and ideals.
Everything she knew or ever became was because of him.
And she looked up to him and worshiped him with a feeling she supposed was love.
Yes, that's very pretty.
I heard a story once. In fact, I've heard a lot of stories in my time.
They went along with the sound of a tinny piano playing in the parlor downstairs.
Mister, I met a man once when I was a kid," they'd always begin.
I guess neither one of our stories is very funny.
Tell me who was it you left me for?
Was it Laszlo, or were there others in between or aren't you the kind that tells?
I strongly suspect that Ugarte left the letters of transit with Mr. Blaine.
I would suggest you search the café immediately.
If Rick has the letters, he's too smart to let you find them there.
You give him credit for too much cleverness.
My impression was he's just another blundering American.
We mustn't underestimate American blundering.
I was with them when they blundered into Berlin in 1918.
As to Laszlo, we want him watched 24 hours a day.
It may interest you to know that at this very moment he's on his way here.
There is nothing we can do.
I'm delighted to see you. Did you have a good night's rest?
I slept very well.
Strange. Nobody's supposed to sleep well in Casablanca.
May we proceed with the business?
With pleasure.
Laszlo, we will not mince words.
You're an escaped prisoner of the Reich.
So far you have been fortunate in eluding us.
You have reached Casablanca.
It is my duty to see that you stay in Casablanca.
Whether or not you will succeed is problematic.
Not at all. Renault's signature is necessary on every visa.
Captain, is it possible that Laszlo will receive a visa?
I'm afraid not.
My regrets, monsieur.
Well, perhaps I shall like it in Casablanca.
And mademoiselle?
You needn't be concerned about me.
Is that all you wish to tell us?
Don't be in such a hurry. You have all the time in the world.
You may be in Casablanca indefinitely.
Or you may leave for Lisbon tomorrow. - On one condition.
And that is?
You know the leader of the underground movement in Paris, in Prague Brussels, Amsterdam Oslo, Belgrade, Athens...
Even Berlin.
Yes, even in Berlin.
If you will furnish me with their names and whereabouts you'll have your visa in the morning.
And the honor of having served the Third Reich.
I was in a German concentration camp for a year.
That's honor enough for a lifetime.
You will give us the names?
If I didn't give them to you in a concentration camp where you had more persuasive methods at your disposal I certainly won't give them to you now.
And what if you track down these men and kill them?
What if you murdered all of us?
From every corner of Europe, hundreds, thousands would rise to take our places.
Even Nazis can't kill that fast.
Herr Laszlo, you have a reputation for eloquence which I can now understand.
But in one aspect you are mistaken.
You said the enemies of the Reich could all be replaced.
But there is one exception.
No one could take your place if anything unfortunate should occur to you while you were trying to escape.
You won't dare to interfere with me here.
This is still unoccupied France.
Any violation of neutrality would reflect on Captain Renault.
Monsieur, insofar as it is in my power.
Thank you.
By the way, monsieur, last night you evinced an interest in Signor Ugarte.
I believe you have a message for him?
Nothing important. But may I speak to him now?
You would find the conversation a trifle one-sided.
Signor Ugarte is dead.
I'm making out the report now.
We haven't quite decided whether he committed suicide or died trying to escape.
Are you quite finished with us?
For the time being.
Good day.
Undoubtedly, their next step will be to the black market.
Excuse me, captain.
Another visa problem has come up.
Show her in.
Sorry, monsieur, we were never to handle the police.
This is a job for Signor Ferrari.
Ferrari?
It can be most helpful to know Signor Ferrari.
He pretty near has a monopoly on the black market here.
You will find him at the Blue Parrot.
Thanks.
Don't be too downhearted.
Perhaps you can come to terms with Renault.
Thank you very much, signor.
Hello, Ferrari.
Good morning, Rick.
The bus is in. I'll take my shipment with me.
I'll have it sent over. Have a drink with me.
I never drink in the morning.
And every time you send my shipment over it's a little short.
Carrying charges, my boy. Carrying charges.
Here, sit down.
There is something I want to talk over with you, anyhow.
Bourbon.
The news about Ugarte upsets me very much.
You're a fat hypocrite. You don't feel any sorrier for Ugarte than I do.
Of course not.
What upsets me is that Ugarte is dead and no one knows where those letters are.
Practically no one.
If I had those letters, I could make a fortune.
So could I, and I'm a poor businessman.
I have a proposition for whoever has those letters.
I'll handle the entire transaction.
Get rid of the letters, take all the risk, for a small percentage.
And the carrying charges?
Naturally there will be a few incidental expenses.
That's my proposition for whoever has those letters.
I'll tell him when he comes in.
Rick, I think you know where those letters are.
You're in good company. Renault and Strasser probably think so too.
That's why I came here. To give them a chance to ransack my place.
Rick, don't be a fool. Take me into your confidence. You need a partner.
Excuse me, I'll be getting back.
Morning.
Signor Ferrari is the fat gent at the table.
You will not find a treasure like this in all Morocco.
Only 700 francs.
You're being cheated.
Doesn't matter, thank you.
For friends of Rick's we have a small discount.
Did I say 700 francs? You can have it for 200.
I'm sorry I was in no condition to receive you when you called on me last night.
Doesn't matter.
For special friends of Rick's we have a special discount. 100 francs.
Your story had me a little confused. Or maybe it was the bourbon.
I have some tablecloths, napkins--
Thank you. I'm really not interested.
Please, one minute.
Why did you come back?
To tell me why you ran out on me at the railway station?
Yes.
Well, you can tell me now. I'm reasonably sober.
I don't think I will, Rick.
Why not? After all, I got stuck with a railway ticket.
Last night I saw what has happened to you.
The Rick I knew in Paris, I could tell him, he'd understand.
But the one who looked at me with such hatred...
I'll be leaving Casablanca soon. We'll never see each other again.
We knew very little about each other when we were in love in Paris.
If we leave it that way, maybe we'll remember those days and not Casablanca.
Not last night.
Did you run out on me because you knew what it would be like?
Hiding from the police, running away all the time?
You can believe that if you want to.
Well, I'm not running away anymore. I'm settled now.
Above a saloon, it's true but walk up a flight I'll be expecting you.
All the same, someday you'll lie to Laszlo.
You'll be there.
No, Rick.
You see, Victor Laszlo is my husband.
And was, even when I knew you in Paris.
I was just telling Monsieur Laszlo that unfortunately I'm not able to help him.
You see, my dear, word has gone around.
As leader of all illegal activities in Casablanca, I am influential and respected.
But it would not be worth my life to do anything for Monsieur Laszlo.
You, however, are a different matter.
Signor Ferrari thinks it might just be possible to get an exit visa for you.
You mean for me to go on alone?
And only alone.
I'll stay here and keep on trying. I'm sure in a little while--
Might as well be frank, monsieur.
It would take a miracle to get you out. The Germans have outlawed miracles.
We are only interested in two visas.
Please, Ilsa, don't be hasty.
No, Victor.
You two will want to discuss this.
Excuse me. I'll be at the bar.
No, Ilsa. I won't let you stay here.
You must get to America. Believe me, somehow I will get out and join you.
But if the situation were different if I had to stay and there were only visa for one would you take it?
Yes, I would.
Yes, I see.
When I had trouble getting out of Lille, why didn't you leave me there?
When I was sick in Marseilles for two weeks and you were in danger every minute why didn't you leave me then?
I meant to, but something always held me up.
I love you very much, Ilsa.
Your secret will be safe with me.
Ferrari is waiting for our answer.
Not more than 50 francs.
We've decided, Signor Ferrari.
For the present we will go on looking for two visas. Thank you very much.
Well, good luck, but be careful.
You know you're being shadowed? - Of course.
It becomes an instinct.
I observe that you, in one respect, are a very fortunate man.
I am moved to make one more suggestion. Why, I do not know.
Because it cannot possibly profit me.
Have you heard about Ugarte and the letters of transit?
Yes, something.
Those letters were not found on Ugarte when they arrested him.
You know where they are?
Not for sure.
But I'd guess that Ugarte left those letters with Monsieur Rick.
A difficult customer, that Rick.
One never knows what he'll do or why.
But it is worth a chance.
Thank you very much.
Goodbye. Thank you for your coffee.
I shall miss that when we leave Casablanca.
Gracious of you to share it with me. Good day, mademoiselle.
Monsieur. - Good day.
Here's to you, sir.
Good luck.
I'd better be going.
My check, please.
I have to warn you, sir.
This is a dangerous place. Full of vultures.
Vultures everywhere. Thanks for everything.
Goodbye.
It has been a pleasure to meet you.
Monsieur Rick, you are getting to be your best customer.
Well, drinking. I'm very pleased with you.
You're beginning to live like a Frenchman.
That was some going-over your men gave my place.
We barely got cleaned up in time to open.
I told Strasser he wouldn't find the letters here.
But I told my men to be especially destructive.
You know how that impresses Germans.
Rick, have you got those letters of transit?
Louis, are you Pro-Vichy or Free French?
Serves me right for asking a direct question.
The subject is closed. It looks like you're a little late.
So Yvonne's gone over to the enemy. Who knows?
In her own way, she may constitute an entire second front.
I think it's time for me to flatter Strasser a little. I'll see you later.
Sascha!
French 75s.
Put up a whole row of them, Sascha.
Starting here and ending here.
We will begin with two.
What did you say?
Would you kindly repeat it?
What I said is none of your business.
I'll make it my business.
I don't like disturbances in my place. Either lay off politics or get out.
You see, captain?
The situation is not as under control as you believe.
We try to cooperate with your government.
But we cannot regulate the feelings of our people.
Captain, are you certain which side you're on?
I have no conviction, if that's what you mean.
I blow with the wind and the prevailing wind happens to be from Vichy.
And if it should change?
Surely the Reich doesn't admit that possibility?
We are concerned about more than Casablanca.
We know that every French province in Africa is honeycombed with traitors.
Waiting for their chance. Waiting perhaps for a leader.
A leader?
Like Laszlo?
I have been thinking.
It's too dangerous to let him go, it may be too dangerous to let him stay.
I see what you mean.
Thank you, Carl.
Thank you, Carl.
Sit down. Have a brandy with us.
To celebrate our leaving for America tomorrow.
Thank you very much.
I thought you would ask me, so I brought the good brandy and a third glass.
At last the day's came!
Frau Leuchtag and I are speaking nothing but English now.
So we should feel at home when we get to America.
A very nice idea.
To America.
To America.
What watch?
Ten watch.
Such much?
You will get along beautifully in America.
How is lady luck treating you?
Oh, too bad.
You'll find him over there.
Monsieur Rick?
Yes?
Could I speak to you, please? - How'd you get in here?
You're underage.
I came with Captain Renault.
I should have known.
My husband is with me too.
He is? Captain Renault's getting broad-minded. Sit down.
Have a drink?
No, of course not. You mind if I do?
Monsieur Rick...
...what kind of a man is Captain Renault?
Like any other man, only more so.
No, I mean is he trustworthy?
Just a minute. Who told you to ask me that?
He did. Captain Renault did.
I thought so. Where's your husband?
At the roulette table, trying to win enough for our exit visas.
Oh, of course he's losing.
How long have you been married?
Eight weeks.
We come from Bulgaria.
Things are very bad there.
The devil has the people by the throat.
So Jan and I, we...
We do not want our children to grow up in such a country.
So you decided to go to America. - Yes.
But we haven't much money and traveling is so expensive and difficult.
It was much more than we thought to get here.
And then Captain Renault sees us...
...and he is so kind, he wants to help us.
Yes, I'll bet.
He tells me he can give us an exit visa.
But we have no money.
Does he know that?
Yes.
And he's still willing to give you a visa?
And you want to know...?
Will he keep his word?
He always has.
You are a man.
If someone loved you very much so that your happiness was the only thing that she wanted in the world and she did a bad thing to make certain of it...
...could you forgive her?
Nobody ever loved me that much.
And he never knew, and the girl kept this bad thing locked in her heart that would be all right, wouldn't it?
You want my advice?
Yes, please.
Go back to Bulgaria.
Oh, but if you knew what it means to us to leave Europe, to get to America...
Oh, but if Jan should find out.
He is such a boy.
In many ways I am so much older than he is.
Yes, well, everybody in Casablanca has problems.
Yours may work out. You'll excuse me.
Thank you, monsieur.
Good evening.
Good evening.
You see? Here we are again.
I take that as a great compliment to Sam.
I suppose he means to you Paris of happier days.
He does.
Could we have a table close to him?
And as far away from Major Strasser as possible.
The geography may be a little difficult to arrange. - Paul, table 30. - Yes, sir.
Right this way, if you please.
I'll have Sam play "As Time Goes By." I believe that's your favorite tune.
Thank you.
Two cognacs, please.
Do you wish to place another bet, sir?
No, I guess not.
Have you tried 22 tonight?
I said 22.
Leave it there.
Cash it in and don't come back.
Are you sure this place is honest?
Honest?
As honest as the day is long.
How are we doing tonight?
A couple of thousand less than I thought there would be.
Monsieur Rick...
He's just a lucky guy.
Monsieur Rick, may I get you a cup of coffee?
No, thanks, Carl. - Monsieur Rick...
Captain Renault, may I--?
Not here. Come to my office in the morning.
We'll do everything businesslike.
We'll be there at 6.
I'll be there at 10.
I'm very happy for both of you.
Still, it's very strange that you won.
Well, maybe not so strange.
I'll see you in the morning.
Thank you, Captain Renault.
Boss, you've done a beautiful thing.
Go away, you crazy Russian.
As I suspected. You're a rank sentimentalist. - Yeah?
Why?
Why do you interfere with my little romances?
Put it down as a gesture to love.
Well, I'll forgive you this time.
But I'll be in tomorrow night with a breathtaking blond.
And it'll make me very happy if she loses.
Mr. Blaine, I wonder if I could talk to you.
Go ahead.
Well, isn't there some other place?
It's rather confidential, what I have to say.
In my office.
You must know it's very important I get out of Casablanca.
It's my privilege to be one of the leaders of a great movement.
You know what I've been doing.
You know what it means to the work, to the lives of thousands of people that I reach America and continue my work.
I'm not interested in politics.
The problems of the world are not in my department.
I'm a saloonkeeper.
My friends in the underground tell me that you have quite a record.
You ran guns to Ethiopia.
You fought against the fascists in Spain.
What of it?
Isn't it strange you're always fighting on the side of the underdog?
Yes, I found that a very expensive hobby.
But then I never was much of a businessman.
Are you enough of a businessman to appreciate an offer of 100,000 francs?
I appreciate it, but I don't accept it.
200,000.
My friend, you could make it a million francs or three.
My answer would still be the same.
There must be some reason why you won't let me.
There is.
I suggest that you ask your wife.
I beg your pardon?
I said, ask your wife.
My wife?
Play "La Marseillaise." Play it!
See what I mean?
If Laszlo's presence in a café can inspire this demonstration what more will his presence in Casablanca bring on?
I advise that this place be shut up at once.
But everybody's having a good time.
Yes, much too good a time.
The place is to be closed.
But I have no excuse to close it.
Everybody is to leave immediately.
This café is closed until further notice.
Clear the room at once.
How can you close me up?
I'm shocked, shocked to find that gambling is going on in here.
Your winnings, sir.
Thank you.
Everybody out at once.
After this disturbance it is not safe for Laszlo to stay in Casablanca.
This morning you implied it wasn't safe to leave Casablanca.
That is also true, except for one destination: occupied France.
Occupied France?
Under safe conduct from me.
Of what value is that?
You may recall what German guarantees have been worth in the past.
There are two other alternatives for him.
What are they?
The French authorities may find a reason to put him in the concentration camp here.
The other alternative?
My dear, perhaps you have already observed that in Casablanca human life is cheap.
Good night, mademoiselle.
What happened with Rick?
We'll discuss it later.
Our faithful friend is still there.
Please don't go to the underground meeting tonight.
I must.
Besides, it isn't often that a man gets to display heroics before his wife.
Don't joke. After Major Strasser's warning tonight, I'm frightened.
Tell you the truth, I'm frightened too.
Shall I remain here in a hotel room, hiding?
Or shall I carry on the best I can?
Whatever I'd say, you would carry on.
Victor, why don't you tell me about Rick? What did you find out?
Apparently he has the letters.
Yes?
But no intention of selling them.
You'd think if sentiment wouldn't persuade him, money would.
Did he give any reason?
He suggested I ask you.
Ask me?
Yes, he said, "Ask your wife."
I don't know why he said that.
Well, our friend outside will think we've retired by now.
I'll be going in a few minutes.
Ilsa, I...
Yes?
When I was in the concentration camp were you lonely in Paris?
Yes, Victor, I was.
I know how it is to be lonely.
Is there anything you wish to tell me?
No, Victor, there isn't.
I love you very much, my dear.
Yes, I know.
Victor, whatever I do, will you believe that I...?
You don't even have to say it.
I'll believe.
Good night, dear.
Good night.
Victor.
Yes, dear?
Be careful.
Of course I'll be careful.
Well, you are in pretty good shape, Herr Rick.
How long can I afford to stay closed?
Two weeks, maybe three.
Maybe I won't have to. A bribe has worked before.
In the meantime, everybody stays on salary.
Thank you, Herr Rick.
Sascha will be happy to hear it.
I owe him money.
You finish locking up, will you, Carl?
I will.
Then I am going to the meeting--
Don't tell me where you're going.
I won't.
Good night.
Good night, Mr. Rick.
How did you get in?
The stairs from the street.
I told you this morning you'd come around, but this is ahead of schedule.
Well, won't you sit down?
Richard, I had to see you.
Richard" again.
We're back in Paris.
Your visit isn't connected by any chance with the letters of transit?
Seems as long as I have those letters I'll never be lonely.
Ask any price you want, but you must give me the letters.
I went all through that with your husband. It's no deal.
I know how you feel about me but put your feelings aside for something more important.
I have to hear again what a great man your husband is what an important cause he's fighting for?
It was your cause too.
In your own way, you were fighting for the same thing.
I'm not fighting for anything anymore except myself.
I'm the only cause I'm interested in.
We loved each other once.
If those days meant anything at all to you--
I wouldn't bring up Paris if I were you. It's poor salesmanship.
Listen to me. If you knew what really happened, if you only knew the truth--
I wouldn't believe you no matter what you said.
You'd say anything now to get what you want.
You want to feel sorry for yourself, don't you?
With so much at stake all you can think of is your feelings.
One woman has hurt you, and you take your revenge on the rest of the world.
You're a coward and a weakling.
Oh, Richard. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, but you are our last hope.
If you don't help us, Victor Laszlo will die in Casablanca.
What of it?
I'm going to die in Casablanca. It's a good spot for it.
Now, if you'll--
All right.
I tried to reason with you.
I tried everything. Now, I want those letters.
Get them for me.
I don't have to. I got them right here.
Put them on the table.
No.
For the last time, put them on the table.
If Laszlo and the cause mean so much to you, you won't stop at anything.
All right, I'll make it easier for you.
Go ahead and shoot. You'll be doing me a favor.
Richard I tried to stay away.
I thought I would never see you again.
That you were out of my life.
The day you left Paris if you knew what I went through.
If you knew how much I loved you.
How much I still love you.
And then?
It wasn't long after we were married that Victor went back to Czechoslovakia.
They needed him in Prague, but there the Gestapo were waiting for him.
Just a two-line item in the paper:
Victor Laszlo apprehended. Sent to concentration camp."
I was frantic. For months I tried to get word.
Then it came.
He was dead. Shot trying to escape.
I was lonely. I had nothing, not even hope.
Then I met you.
Why weren't you honest with me? Why did you keep your marriage a secret?
It wasn't my secret, Richard. Victor wanted it that way.
Not even our closest friends knew about our marriage.
That was his way of protecting me. I knew so much about his work.
If the Gestapo found out I was his wife it would be dangerous for me and for those working with us.
And when did you first find out he was alive?
Just before you and I were to leave Paris together.
A friend came and told me that Victor was alive.
They were hiding him in a freight car on the outskirts of Paris.
He was sick. He needed me.
I wanted to tell you, but I didn't dare.
I knew you wouldn't have left Paris, and the Gestapo would have caught you.
Well well, you know the rest.
Well, it's still a story without an ending.
What about now?
Now?
I don't know.
I know that I'll never have the strength to leave you again.
And Laszlo?
You'll help him now, Richard, won't you?
You'll see that he gets out.
Then he'll have his work. All that he's been living for.
All except one.
He won't have you.
I can't fight it anymore.
I ran away from you once. I can't do it again.
Oh, I don't know what's right any longer.
You have to think for both of us.
For all of us.
All right.
I will.
Here's looking at you, kid.
I wish I didn't love you so much.
I think we lost them.
Yes.
I'm afraid they caught some of the others.
Come inside.
Come, Mr. Laszlo, I will help you immediately.
Carl, what happened?
The police break up our meeting, Herr Rick.
We escaped at the last moment.
Come up here a minute.
Yes, I come.
Turn out the light in the rear entrance. It might attract the police.
But Sascha always puts out that light.
Tonight he forgot.
Yes, I come. I will do it.
I want you to take Miss Lund home.
Yes, sir.
It's nothing, just a little cut. We had to get through a window.
This might come in handy.
Thank you.
Had a close one, eh?
Yes, rather.
Don't you sometimes wonder if it's worth all this?
I mean, what you're fighting for.
We might as well question why we breathe.
If we stop breathing, we'll die.
If we stop fighting our enemies, the world will die.
What of it? Then it'll be out of its misery.
You know how you sound, Monsieur Blaine?
Like a man who's trying to convince himself of something he doesn't believe in his heart.
Each of us has a destiny.
For good, or for evil.
I get the point.
I wonder if you do.
I wonder if you know that you're trying to escape from yourself and that you'll never succeed.
You seem to know all about my destiny.
I know a good deal more about you than you suspect.
I know that you're in love with a woman.
It's perhaps a strange circumstance that we both should be in love with the same woman.
The first evening I came into this café I knew there was something between you and Ilsa.
Since no one is to blame I demand no explanation.
I ask only one thing. You won't give me the letters of transit.
All right.
But I want my wife to be safe.
I ask you as a favor to use the letters to take her away from Casablanca.
You love her that much?
Apparently you think of me only as the leader of a cause.
Well, I am also a human being.
Yes, I love her that much.
Monsieur Laszlo? - Yes?
You'll come with us.
We have a warrant for your arrest.
On what charge?
Captain Renault will discuss that with you later.
It seems that destiny has taken a hand.
You haven't any proof, and you know it. This isn't Germany or occupied France.
All you can do is fine him and give him 30 days.
You might as well let him go now.
I'd advise you not to be too interested in what happens to Laszlo.
If you were to help him escape--
What makes you think I'd stick my neck out for Laszlo?
Because, one, you bet 10,000 francs he'd escape.
Two, you've got the letters of transit. Don't bother to deny it.
And you might do it simply because you don't like Strasser's looks.
As a matter of fact, I don't either.
They're all excellent reasons.
Don't count too much on my friendship.
In this matter I'm powerless.
Besides, I might lose the 10,000 francs.
You're not very subtle, but you are effective.
Yes, I have the letters.
But I intend using them myself.
I'm leaving Casablanca on tonight's plane. The last plane.
And I'm taking a friend with me. One you'll appreciate.
What friend?
Ilsa Lund.
That ought to put your mind to rest about my helping Laszlo escape.
The last man I want to see in America.
You didn't come here to tell me this.
You have the letters of transit.
You can fill in your name and hers and leave anytime you please.
Why are you still interested in what happens to Laszlo?
I'm not. But I am interested in what happens to Ilsa and me.
We have a legal right to go, that's true but people have been held in Casablanca in spite of their legal rights.
What makes you think we want to hold you?
Ilsa is Laszlo's wife.
She probably knows things that Strasser would like to know.
Louis, I'll make a deal with you.
Instead of this petty charge against him, you could get something big something that would chuck him in a concentration camp for years...
Be quite a feather in your cap, wouldn't it?
Certainly. Germany-- Vichy would be very grateful.
Then release him.
You be at my place a half-hour before the plane leaves.
I'll have Laszlo come there to pick up the letters and that'll give you grounds to make the arrest.
You get him, and we get away.
To the Germans, that last will be just a minor annoyance.
There's still something about this I don't quite understand.
Miss Lund, she is very beautiful, yes but you were never interested in any woman.
She isn't just any woman.
I see.
How do I know you'll keep your end of the bargain?
I'll make the arrangements now with Laszlo in the visitor's pen.
I'm gonna miss you.
You're the only one in Casablanca who has less scruples than I.
Oh, thanks.
Go ahead, Ricky.
Call off your watchdogs when you let him go. I don't want them around this afternoon.
I'm taking no chances, Louis, not even with you.
Should we draw up papers, or is a handshake good enough?
Certainly not good enough. But since I'm in a hurry, it'll have to do.
To get out of Casablanca and go to America... You're a lucky man.
My agreement with Sam is that he gets 25 percent of the profits. That still goes.
I happen to know he gets 10 percent. But he's worth 25.
Abdul, Carl and Sascha, they stay with the place or I don't sell.
Of course. Rick's wouldn't be Rick's without them.
Well, so long.
Don't forget you owe Rick's 100 cartons of American cigarettes.
I shall remember to pay it to myself.
You're late.
I was informed when Laszlo left the hotel so I knew I'd be on time.
I asked you to tie up your watchdogs.
He won't be followed here.
This place will never be the same without you.
I know what you mean.
But I've spoken to Ferrari. You'll still win at roulette.
Is everything ready?
I have the letters right here.
When we searched the place, where were they?
Sam's piano.
Serves me right for not being musical.
Here they are.
You better wait in my office.
Victor thinks I'm leaving with him. Haven't you told him?
Not yet.
But you were able to arrange everything?
Everything is quite all right.
We'll tell him at the airport. The less time to think, the easier.
Please trust me.
Yes, I will.
I don't know how to thank you.
Save it. We've still lots of things to do.
I brought the money.
Keep it, you'll need it in America.
But we made a deal.
Never mind that.
You won't have any trouble in Lisbon?
No. It's all arranged. Good.
I've got the letters here, made out in blank.
All you have to do is fill in the signatures.
Victor Laszlo.
Victor Laszlo, you're under arrest.
The charge of accessory to the murder of the couriers from whom the letters were stolen.
You're surprised about my friend Ricky? The explanation is simple.
Love, it seems, has triumphed over virtue. Thank--
Not so fast, Louis. Nobody is going to be arrested. Not for a while yet.
Have you lost your mind? - I have.
Sit down.
Put that gun down.
I don't want to shoot you but I will if you take one more step.
Under the circumstances, I will sit down.
Keep your hands on the table.
I wonder if you realize what this means.
I do. We've got time to discuss that later.
Call off your watchdogs, you said.
Just the same, call the airport and let me hear you tell them.
And remember, this gun is pointed right at your heart.
That is my least vulnerable spot.
Hello? Is that the airport?
This is Captain Renault speaking.
There'll be two letters of transit for the Lisbon plane.
There's to be no trouble about them.
Good.
Hello?
My car, quickly!
This is Major Strasser.
Have a squad of police meet me at the airport at once.
At once, do you hear?
Hello, radio tower?
Lisbon plane taking off in 10 minutes, east runway.
Visibility, 1 1/2 miles.
Light ground fog.
Depth of fog approximately 500.
Ceiling unlimited.
Have your man go with Laszlo and take care of his luggage.
Certainly, Rick, anything you say.
Find Laszlo's luggage. Put it on the plane.
Yes, sir.
This way, please.
If you don't mind, fill in the names. That'll make it more official.
You think of everything, don't you?
And the names are Mr. and Mrs. Victor Laszlo.
But why my name, Richard?
Because you're getting on that plane.
I don't understand. What about you?
I'm staying with him till the plane gets away.
What has happened? Last night you said--
Last night we said a great many things.
You said I was to do the thinking for us.
I've done a lot of it since then. It adds up to one thing:
You're getting on that plane with Victor where you belong.
Now, you've got to listen to me.
Any idea what you'd have to look forward to if you stayed here?
Chances are we'd both wind up in a concentration camp. True, Louis?
I'm afraid Major Strasser would insist.
You're saying this only to make me go.
I'm saying it because it's true.
Inside of us we both know you belong with Victor.
You're part of his work, the thing that keeps him going.
If that plane leaves and you're not with him, you'll regret it.
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon, and for the rest of your life.
But what about us?
We'll always have Paris.
We didn't have- - We'd lost it until you came to Casablanca.
We got it back last night.
When I said I would never leave you.
And you never will.
But I've got a job to do too.
Where I'm going, you can't follow.
What I've got to do you can't be any part of.
Ilsa, I'm no good at being noble.
But it doesn't take much to see that the problems of three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world.
Someday you'll understand that.
Now, now.
Here's looking at you, kid.
Everything is in order. - All except one thing.
There's something you should know.
I don't ask you to explain anything.
I'm going to anyway. It may make a difference to you later on.
You said you knew about Ilsa and me.
You didn't know she was at my place last night when you were.
She came there for the letters of transit.
Yes.
She tried everything to get them. Nothing worked.
She did her best to convince me that she was still in love with me.
But that was all over long ago.
For your sake, she pretended it wasn't, and I let her pretend.
I understand.
Here it is.
Thanks.
I appreciate it.
Welcome back to the fight.
This time I know our side will win.
Are you ready, Ilsa?
Yes, I'm ready.
Goodbye, Rick.
God bless you.
You better hurry. You'll miss that plane.
I was right. You are a sentimentalist.
Stay where you are.
I don't know what you're talking about.
What you just did for Laszlo.
That fairy tale you invented to send Ilsa away with him.
I know a little about women, my friend. She went.
But she knew you were lying.
Anyway, thanks for helping me out.
I suppose you know this isn't going to be pleasant for either of us.
Especially for you.
I'll have to arrest you, of course.
As soon as the plane goes, Louis.
What was the meaning of that phone call?
Victor Laszlo is on that plane.
Why do you stand here? Why don't you stop him?
Ask Monsieur Rick.
Get away from that phone.
I advise you not to interfere.
I was willing to shoot Captain Renault, and I'm willing to shoot you.
Hello!
Put that phone down.
Get me the radio tower.
Put it down!
Major Strasser has been shot.
Round up the usual suspects.
Well, Rick, you're not only a sentimentalist, but you've become a patriot.
Maybe, but it seemed like a good time to start.
I think perhaps you're right.
It might be a good idea for you to disappear from Casablanca for a while.
There's a Free French garrison over at Brazzaville.
I could be induced to arrange a passage.
My letter of transit?
I could use a trip.
But it doesn't change our bet. You still owe me 10,000 francs.
That 10,000 francs should pay our expenses.
Our" expenses?
Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.
Uh...
Thank you.
You won't believe this. You've probably heard it a dozen times before.
But I've never known any artists.
I'm not an artist.
Oh. What's all this?
I do sketches for fashion drawing.
Oh. - May I see it?
Oh, no.
It's not good.
If I let you see it, you might not want to know any artists ever.
(CHUCKLES) I'm afraid it'd have to be pretty bad to do that.
Besides, look... "Let no one say and say it to your shame..."
Irena Dubrovna. Is that a Russian name?
No. I'm from Serbia.
Oh, I see.
Would you mind spelling it?
Want to know how to spell my name?
Are you going to write me a letter?
I'd like to write you a letter.
What about?
I would say in this letter, "Dear Miss Dubrovna..."
I would say, "Will you have tea with me?"
Well, in that case I'd just have to write you another letter. - I'd say...
Here's my house.
Perhaps, Mr. Reed, you would like to have tea in my apartment?
Oh, Miss Dubrovna.
You make life so simple.
You know,
I never cease to marvel at what lies behind a brownstone front.
Well, what's the matter?
Nothing.
But you... you looked at me in such a funny way.
I have never had anyone here.
You're the first friend I met in America.
Oh, I know lots of people in business.
Editors, secretaries, other sketch artists, you know.
But you might be my first real friend.
Thank you.
Nice.
That's Lalage.
Lalage?
The perfume I use.
I like it.
Perhaps too well. Maybe I use too much of it, living alone like this.
It's hard to describe. Not like flowers, exactly. It's...
It's like something warm and living.
## (IRENA HUMMING)
(ANIMALS GROWLING, SNARLING)
What's that? It's the lions in the zoo. One can hear them here often.
Many people in this building complain. The roaring keeps them awake.
And you don't mind it?
No.
To me, it's the way the sound of the sea is to others... natural and soothing.
Some nights there is another sound... the panther.
It screams like a woman.
I don't like that.
Oh, I hadn't realized how dark it was getting.
I like the dark. It's friendly.
No, no, keep still, please.
Are you admiring my statue?
Not exactly.
Who's it supposed to be?
King John.
Oh, King John. The Magna Carta and all that stuff?
No.
King John of Serbia.
He was a fine king.
He drove the Mamelukes out of Serbia and freed the people.
Well, why have this around?
Well, perhaps you have in your room a picture of George Washington or Abraham Lincoln.
(CHUCKLES) Well, what does it mean?
Why is he... Why is he spearing that cat?
Oh, it's not really a cat.
It's meant to represent the evil ways into which my village had once fallen.
You see, the Mamelukes came to Serbia long ago and they made the people slaves.
Well, at first, the people were good and worshipped God in a true Christian way.
But, uh, little by little, the people changed.
When King John drove out the Mamelukes and came to our village, he found dreadful things.
People bowed down to Satan and said their masses to him.
They had become witches and were evil.
Well, King John put some of them to the sword.
But some, the wisest and the most wicked,
escaped into the mountains.
Now do you understand?
Well, I still don't see what it has to do with you.
Those who escaped, the wicked ones, their legend haunts the village where I was born.
(CLOCK BELL CHIMING)
Boys who come to tea can't expect to stay to dinner.
Some other time perhaps.
Tomorrow?
Well, what time tomorrow?
Dinner?
A little more to the left, Harry.
Easy. Just a hair.
I'm afraid she's gonna be all right, Alice.
She's got what it takes, all right, Commodore.
(KITTEN YOWLING)
Oh, isn't it a darling?
Where'd you get it?
I bought it.
You're not going in for cats, are you?
No, Commodore, I just bought it for a friend.
We arrived at the inescapable conclusion that our Oliver has a girl.
A brilliant deduction, Carver. I want to show you something.
A girlfriend?
A girl.
Anybody I know?
Not yet, but I know you'll like her.
Well, if you like her, she's okay with me.
(DOORBELL BUZZES) - (KITTEN MEWING)
Well, hello.
(KITTEN MEWS) Look, Irena. I brought you a present.
(YOWLS)
Why, you little devil.
Oh, it's all right.
It's just that cats don't seem to like me.
Yeah, but this is only a kitten.
It's very friendly. that's the girl who works in our department... it played with her. When I had it in the office, Alice...
(CHUCKLES) Cats just don't like me.
Oh, I know what we can do.
You got it at a pet store, didn't you?
Yes.
Good.
Well, we could exchange it for some other pet.
I'll get my coat.
(SQUAWKING) - (CHITTERING)
(PET NOISES CONTINUE, LOUD)
I'd like to exchange this kitten for a canary.
You'll have to talk louder.
What did you say?
I can't understand a word you say.
I can't imagine what...
Oh, landie-dearie me. I can't imagine what got into them.
All that caterwauling.
The last time they did that was when an alley cat got in and ate up one of my nice Rice finches.
I wanted to exchange this kitten for a bird.
Why, of course. I have some lovely canaries.
One little lemon-colored fellow with top notes like Caruso.
(BIRDS CHIRPING HAPPILY)
As peaceful as my dream of heaven.
Shall we go back now and select just which little birdie?
You go, please, Oliver. You pick the one you like.
I'd rather stay here.
Of course.
I'll only be a minute.
Animals are ever so psychic.
There are some people who just can't come in here.
My dear brother's wife, for instance.
She's a very nice girl. I have nothing against her.
But you just should see what happens when she puts her foot inside this place.
The cats particularly, they seem to know.
You can fool everybody, but landie-dearie me, you can't fool a cat.
They seem to know who's not right, if you know what I mean.
Here we are.
Isn't he a ducky little angel?
This is it.
Thank you.
What do you think of it?
Oh, he is sweet.
He will like me very much.
You will see. I like to be liked.
That ought to be easy.
Really easy.
Irena.
Yes.
I fell asleep.
I know.
Couldn't have been very entertaining for you.
I was watching you.
And that was fun?
Mm-hmm.
Do you love me, Irena?
Mm-hmm.
You know I love you, don't you?
I've never kissed you.
Do you know, that's funny.
Why?
Well... when people in America are in love, or even think they're in love, they've usually kissed long ago.
Well?
Irena, what's wrong?
I've lived in dread of this moment.
I've never wanted to love you.
I've stayed away from people, I...
I lived alone.
I never wanted this to happen.
But you just told me you love me.
I do.
I've fled from the past, from things you could never know or understand.
Evil things.
Evil.
Irena, you've told me something of the past... about King John and the witches in the village and the cat people descended from them.
They're fairy tales, Irena.
Fairy tales heard in your childhood. Nothing more than that.
They've nothing to do with you, really.
You're Irena. You're here in America.
You're so normal, you're even in love with me, Oliver Reed, a good, plain Americano.
You're so normal, you're gonna marry me.
And those fairy tales, you can tell them to our children. They'll love them.
It's all right. It's all right.
Aha! Komitadji!
Oh, Mr. Carver, you should not call a good man that.
But it's Serbian. I got it from my barber this afternoon.
But you might insult him.
Komitadji means "thief," "bandit."
I've been double-crossed.
(ALL LAUGHING)
Oliver's bride seems to be a very nice girl. And a very pretty one too.
Carver tells me she's a bit odd.
He's worried about the marriage.
Nonsense.
Irena's a grand girl.
She and Oliver are going to be very happy together.
I certainly hope so.
## (ENDS)
To the bride.
The bride! - (GUESTS) The bride!
Look at that woman. Isn't she something?
Looks like a cat.
Thank you so much for this lovely party, Alice.
I didn't know there was a Serbian restaurant.
Anything you want to know about this city, ask me.
I know all the unimportant details.
Moja sestra.
Moja sestra?
(ALL CHATTERING) - Well, how do you like that?
What did that woman say to you, darling?
Well, what did she say?
Wait a minute.
It can't be that serious, just one single word.
She greeted me.
She called me "sister."
You saw her, Oliver.
You saw what she looked like.
Oh, the cat people.
She looks like a cat, so she must be one of the cat people, one of King John's pets.
(CHUCKLING) Oh, Irena, you crazy kid.
I know a joke about weddings.
Why would my wedding be a dollar-and-cents wedding, eh?
All right, why?
Because I haven't a dollar, and me girl hasn't any sense.
That's a corny joke even for you, Doc.
(CARVER, IRENA LAUGHING)
What is it, darling?
I'm...
I'm going to beg.
Mrs. Reed?
It's nice to hear that.
I want to be Mrs. Reed.
Well, you are.
But I want to be Mrs. Reed really.
I want to be everything that name means to me.
And I can't. I can't.
Oliver... be kind, be patient.
Let me have time.
Time to get over that feeling there's something evil in me.
Darling, you can have all the time there is in the world if you want it, and all the patience and kindness there is in me.
Only a little time, Oliver.
I don't want more than that.
OLIVER: Good night, Irena.
(ANIMALS YOWLING, FAINT)
Good night, Oliver.
Good night, Irena.
Well, ain't seen you here in some time, ma'am.
Been married. Been married for almost a month.
That's what I tell this critter.
Nobody comes to see him when they're happy. No, sir.
The monkey house and the aviary gets the happy customers.
But he's beautiful.
No, he ain't beautiful.
He's an evil critter, ma'am.
You read your Bible.
In Revelations, where the book's talking about the worst beast of them all, it says,
And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard."
Like unto a leopard.
Yes, ma'am.
Like a leopard, but not a leopard.
I guess that fits this feller.
Yes, it fits him.
Uh, best wishes for your marriage, ma'am.
## (IRENA HUMMING)
(BIRD WHISTLING)
(WHISTLES) - (BIRD SQUAWKS)
(WHISTLES)
Would you like some sherry?
If you're determined to mourn that bird, we'll have a regular wake.
It's not just because the bird died.
It's me.
I envy every woman I see on the street.
They can't match your little finger.
I envy them.
They are happy. They make their husbands happy.
They lead normal, happy lives.
They're free.
Do you know what happened to the bird?
It died.
It died of fright when I tried to take it in my hand.
All right, the bird was afraid of you. That's nothing.
I had a rabbit once that hated me, yet I grew up to be quite a nice fella.
Oliver.
When I went past the panther's cage,
I had to open the box.
I had to throw the bird to him.
Do you understand?
I had to. I had to do it.
That's what frightens me.
Irena, I've been trying to kid you out of it.
Maybe that's wrong.
I've tried to...
No one could have been more gentle or more patient.
I've tried to make you realize all these stories that worry you are so much nonsense.
But now I see it's not the stories. It's the fact that you believe them.
We've got to have help, Irena.
Not that sort of help.
There's something wrong, and we have to face it in an intelligent way.
We don't need a King John with fire and sword.
We need someone who can find the reason for your belief and cure it.
That's what we need.
A psychiatrist.
Oh, find one for me, Oliver.
The best one. The very best one.
You were saying, the cats...
They torment me.
I wake in the night, and the tread of their feet whispers in my brain.
I have no peace, for they are in me.
PSYCHIATRIST: In me.
In me.
Hypnosis always tires me.
Some of my patients, too, find it exhausting.
It's only that I... I remember nothing.
It's my duty to remember. I have it all here.
Most interesting.
You told me of your village and the people and their strange beliefs.
I'm so ashamed. It must seem so childish.
And the cat women of your village too. You told me of them.
Women who, in jealousy or anger or out of their own corrupt passions, can change into great cats, like panthers.
And if one of these women were to fall in love, and if her lover were to kiss her, take her into his embrace, she would be driven by her own evil to kill him.
That's what you believe and fear, isn't it?
These things are very simple to psychiatrists.
You told me about your childhood.
Perhaps we will find this trouble stems from some early experience.
You said you didn't know your father, that he died in some mysterious accident in the forest before your birth.
And because of that, the children teased you and called your mother a witch, a cat woman.
These childhood tragedies are inclined to corrode the soul, to leave a canker in the mind.
But we'll try to repair the damage.
You're not to worry.
What shall I tell my husband?
Naturally, he's anxious to have some word.
What does one tell a husband?
One tells him nothing.
Alice, it's so nice to see you.
Hello, darling.
How'd you make out with Louis?
Louis?
Dr. Judd.
Alice knows, darling.
Of course.
Didn't I suggest Dr. Judd?
I met him on the commodore's boat.
The way he goes around kissing hands makes me want to spit cotton.
But I guess he knows all there is to know about psychiatry.
Uh-oh.
I told Alice. I knew she'd know some good doctor.
I don't see why that was necessary.
Sorry.
I seem to have put my big foot in it.
I'm sorry, Irena.
I'm sure neither Oliver nor I had any notion of offending you.
I'm dreadfully sorry.
Good-bye, Alice.
Darling, really, there's no reason to...
But, Oliver, how can you discuss such things?
Such intimate things about me?
How much did you tell her?
You can tell Alice anything. She's such a good egg.
She can understand anything.
There are some things a woman doesn't want other women to understand.
(CAT YOWLING)
Irena.
I woke up. You were gone.
What's wrong, darling?
I couldn't sleep. I went out.
Where'd you go?
Just walked.
I'm sorry about this afternoon.
I just didn't think.
Oliver, we should never quarrel.
Never let me feel jealousy or anger.
Whatever is in me is held in, is kept harmless when I am happy.
I'd turn handsprings, darling.
I'd dance in the streets to make you happy.
Toward the sheer line.
Sixty-two degrees.
Hey.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I must have given you the wrong figure. Let me try again.
Wait. Let's have a cigarette first.
That's the third wrong figure you've given me this morning.
Getting careless in my old age.
Something's on your mind. Anything wrong?
Nope.
Must be marriage.
Well, in a way, it is.
I'm worried about Irena.
But I thought she was going to Dr. Judd.
Yeah, that's what I thought. But I ran into Dr. Judd this morning.
She hasn't been back since the first visit.
But you told me she seemed so anxious to be cured.
Apparently not.
I'm sorry, Ollie.
Must make you very unhappy.
You know, it's a funny thing.
I've never been unhappy before.
Things have always gone swell for me. I had a grand time as a kid.
Lots of fun at school and here at the office with you and the commodore and Doc.
That's why I don't know what to do about all this.
I've just never been unhappy.
Hey.
Now, wait a minute.
I... can't help it. I just can't help it.
I can't bear to see you unhappy.
I love you too darn much, and I don't care if you do know it, Ollie.
I love you.
I'm sorry.
Forget it.
There's Irena. You're in love with her.
I don't know.
All this trouble has made me think...
I don't know what love really is.
I don't know... even whether I'm in love with Irena.
I know what love is.
It's understanding.
It's you and me, and let the rest of the world go by.
It's just the two of us living our lives together, happily and proudly.
No self-torture and no doubt.
It's enduring and it's everlasting.
Nothing can change it.
Nothing can change us, Ollie.
That's what I think love is.
Well... that isn't the way I feel about Irena.
It's a different feeling.
I'm drawn to her.
There's a warmth from her that... pulls at me.
I have to watch her when she's in the room.
I have to touch her when she's near.
But I don't really know her.
In many ways, we're strangers.
You and I, we'll never be strangers.
(SNARLS)
You forgot your key.
Oh, I'm always forgetting it. But ain't no worry in it.
Nobody would want to steal one of them critters.
You resist temptation admirably.
Temptation?
The, uh, key.
Why would I want it?
For many reasons.
There is, in some cases, a psychic need to loose evil upon the world.
And we all of us carry within us a desire for death.
You fear the panther, yet you're drawn to him again and again.
Couldn't you turn to him as an instrument of death?
You didn't come back to see me Friday. I've had to come to you.
Well, how did you know where to find me?
You told me many things.
Why didn't you come back?
I don't feel you can help me.
You're very wise. You know a great deal.
Yet when you speak of the soul, you mean the mind.
And it is not my mind that is troubled.
What a clever girl.
All the psychologists have tried for years to find that subtle difference between mind and soul.
And you found it.
It does seem presumptuous of me, doesn't it?
Good-bye, Doctor.
Irena.
I'm worried. What's happening to us?
I love you, Oliver.
I know, but people can love and people can still drift apart.
And that's what I feel is happening to us.
We don't talk together openly.
You're not frank with me.
I've never lied to you.
I ran into Dr. Judd today.
You haven't been back to see him.
He cannot help me.
Well, you won't let him help you. You won't let me help you.
You won't even help yourself.
It's what I said to Alice this afternoon.
You're content to go on as we are...
Alice.
Oh, I... I promised you we'd never quarrel.
Let's calm down a bit.
I'll go back to the office.
I've got some work to do.
(DOOR CLOSES)
Oh, do you wanna go up to the office, Mr. Reed?
I think I'll go round the corner to Sally Lunn's, get a cup of coffee before I get to work.
I'll be back.
Hello, Mr. Reed.
Minnie.
Maybe you'd like some nice chicken gumbo today?
No, thanks, Minnie.
How about some apple pie and a cup of coffee?
Yes, sir.
My goodness, don't nobody like chicken gumbo?
(PHONE RINGS)
Hello.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello.
John Paul Jones, don't you hate people who do that?
Good night, John Paul.
Here, Mrs. Agnew, a couple new matchbooks for your collection.
Oh, thank you, Miss Moore.
Ooh. Chartreuse.
Ain't that elegant?
Too bad you wasn't here just a minute ago.
Mr. Reed looked in.
Oh, where'd he go?
Said he was going around the corner to Sally Lunn's.
I'll see if I can catch him.
Good night.
Good night, Miss Moore.
Could you squeeze the coffee pot for me, Minnie?
Hello.
I sure could. Only this coffee's been working so long, it's got muscles.
What are you doing in this part of town at this hour of night?
Stormy weather.
Ollie, you're going to have to solve your problems your own way.
I'm going to drink up and go home.
I think you'd better go home, too, and make it up with Irena.
Alice, you're very swell.
That's what makes me dangerous. I'm the new type of other woman.
Good night, Minnie.
Good night.
You cold?
A cat just walked over my grave.
Don't you want me to walk you home?
No, thanks.
I'm a big girl now and I'm not afraid.
Well, good night.
Good night.
(FOOTSTEPS CONTINUE, STOP)

Taxi, lady?
(DOOR OPENS)
No, please don't.
Don't touch me.
Irena.
I'm sorry.
I've been worried to death. I didn't know where you were.
I thought...
What happened tonight happens in every family.
I was all on edge.
You've got to understand and you've got to forgive me.
I forgive you.
Irena.
What?
Are you all right?
I'm all right.
(CRYING)
JUDD: To loose evil upon the world.
There is, in some cases, a psychic need to loose evil upon the world.
There is, in some cases, a psychic need, a desire for death.
To loose evil.
A desire for death.
A psychic need.
The, uh, key.
The, uh, key.
The, uh, key.
The, uh, key.
I'm afraid this is dull for Irena.
Darling, there are some beautiful moderns upstairs.
Why don't you take a look at them?
But I like these little boats.
I want to be with you.
Don't send me away.
We're not sending you away.
We just don't want you to be bored.
We'll meet you in the main lobby in an hour.
Oh, Ollie, look, a drawing of the Victory.
You know, that's the last man-of-war with a lateen sail aft.
Could I have the key for the swimming pool?
Of course, dearie.
Oh, what a darling kitten.
Yeah. It's one of four. A tabby had 'em about a month ago.
Don't forget to turn the lights out when you're through, will ya?
I won't forget.
(PHONE BUZZES)
Hello?
Yeah.
Just a moment, dearie.
Yes? - Is Miss Moore in?
She just went downstairs to the swimming pool.
Would it be all right if I went down to see her?
Of course, dearie. Right down them steps there.
Ah, gee, I can't tonight.

(SCREAMING CONTINUES) - (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
Gee whiz, Mrs. Hanson.
(FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
(ECHOING) Help!
(SCREAMING)
What is the matter, Alice?
What bothers Miss Moore?
Gee whiz, dearie.
Are you all right? - It's nothing.
It was dark down here, and Mrs. Reed coming in unexpectedly frightened me.
I'm terribly sorry.
No, don't go.
I'm coming right out.
Sorry to have disturbed you, Alice.
I missed you and Oliver, and I thought you might know where he is.
We waited for you at the museum. You'll probably find him at home.
If you don't mind then, I'll run on.
Could I have my robe, please?
Gee whiz, honey. It's torn to ribbons.
Thank you for coming at so late an hour, Dr. Judd.
I phoned you because I'm troubled. I think you can help me.
How much do you believe about the cat people?
The cat people?
The story Mrs. Reed told me? Yes.
I believe, my dear Miss Moore, exactly as I told Mrs. Reed...
The story is a product of her own fear, her own overworked imagination.
What would you say, Dr. Judd, if I were to tell you that I believe Irena's story?
Yes?
Twice I've been followed by something that was not human, something that attempted to take my life.
I believe that was the cat form of Irena.
But why should she wish to harm you?
Because I'm in love with her husband.
Oh, my dear Miss Moore.
This story grows more and more charming.
Simpler, too, all the time.
You're both victims of fear.
Mrs. Reed fears the past, and you fear the present.
Mrs. Reed has a very strong imagination, and you have an equally strong conscience.
Dr. Judd, the danger that threatened me was very real.
You disappoint me, Miss Moore.
Here's my robe.
To understand this, I should first have to hear
Mrs. Reed's version of the story myself.
That should be a most interesting interview.
I shouldn't advise you to see her alone.
Do you think I'm afraid of so charming a lady?
Dr. Judd, I know you don't believe me, but you must be careful.
Oh, you want me to carry some means of protection.
A gun, perhaps, with a silver bullet. Is that what you mean?
If you are lucky enough to have one.
Hmm.
Of course... this isn't silver.
Good night, Miss Moore.
You say you have lapses of memory for which you cannot account.
They're becoming more frequent, and you're afraid.
Help me.
I can't help you. You're not truthful with me.
But I am. I've told you everything. I have not lied to you.
Do you sincerely believe that if your husband were to kiss you, you would change into a cat and rend him to bits?
I don't know. I am only afraid.
And if I were to kiss you?
I only know that I should not like to be kissed by you.
My dear Mrs. Reed, sometimes in my profession, there comes a contest of wills between the doctor and his patient.
Patients are clever. Very clever.
And they can fool the doctor sometimes.
You're very clever.
And perhaps you enjoy this little game you are having with me.
But I shall discover your secret.
Dr. Judd, believe me. I beg you to believe me.
I have no secret.
I told you everything. I have not lied to you.
I need your help.
I can't help you.
But I can warn you.
These hallucinations approach insanity.
This nonsense about Miss Moore at the park and in the swimming pool... it's a deterioration of the mind, an escape into fantasy.
And it's dangerous.
At this moment,
I could go before a board and have you put away for observation.
You're that close to real insanity.
I can't help you.
You can only help yourself.
You keep going back to the mad legends of your birthplace.
Forget them.
You surround yourself with cat objects, pictures.
Get rid of them. Lead a normal life.
You know, for the first time, you've really helped me.
Maybe it's because you interest me.
Oliver.
I went back to Dr. Judd's office.
I'm no longer afraid.
Believe me, Irena, I'd have been the happiest man in the world if you told me that a little while ago.
But things have changed.
I had to learn, maybe through this marriage of ours.
I didn't want to tell you this, but now, you see, I have to.
I love Alice.
Irena, it's too late.
Too late.
Well, there seems only one decent thing for me to do.
I'll give you a divorce.
Believe me, it's better this way.
Better? Better for whom?
Irena, I...
Speak.
You can't speak.
There's nothing you can say.
There's only silence.
But I love silence.
I love loneliness.
(WHISPERING) And they... they are in me.
Their strength, warmth.
Their softness. Their softness.
Irena, you're talking like an insane woman. Please go.
I want you to go. Please.
Go.
Go!
(DOOR CLOSES)
Bavarian cream?
Roquefort?
And you get the apple pie.
I have pointed out two alternatives, Mr. Reed...
Either have her put away for observation and restraint or have your marriage annulled.
It's tough for Oliver either way, Doctor.
As a psychiatrist, I should recommend that you have her put away.
As your friend, however, I have much more reasonable advice to offer.
I think you should have your marriage annulled.
In that way, you are free of responsibility.
You two could marry.
And if Irena's sent away?
The law is quite explicit. One cannot divorce an insane person.
If she's not well, I've got to take care of her.
It's the only right thing, Ollie.
As you will.
I'll have the commitment papers drawn up and arrange an interview with Mrs. Reed at her apartment tonight.
Shall we say 6:00?
Let's not play that.
I don't think Irena's coming. We've waited an hour and a half.
Perhaps it's useless to wait.
OLIVER: I don't think she intends coming.
She's probably walking in the park.
Ollie, let's get back to the office. We've had a terribly broken-up day.
There's lots of work to be done.
Suits me.
Oh, how stupid of me. I left my walking stick in the apartment.
Oh, I'll get it for you.
Oh, no, it's my fault.
Give me the key. I shall only be a moment.
OLIVER: Five and a half.
ALICE:
Five and a half.
And... one and three-eighths.
And one and three-eighths.
There.
(PHONE RINGING)
I'll get it.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello!
They hung up on me.
That's funny.
What? It happened once before like that.
The telephone rang, and I answered.
There was someone on the other end of the line.
I could almost hear them listening.
And then there was a little click as they hung up the receiver.
That was the night I was followed on the transverse.
Ollie...
let's get out of here. I'm afraid.
That was Irena. I know it was Irena who called.
She could call from downstairs. She may be on her way up now.
Get your things.
The door's open. We can see to get out into the hall.
I'll turn out the table lights.
It's shut now. Just a minute ago, it was open.
(HANDLE RATTLING)
It's locked.
(GROWLING)
(GROWLING) Irena.
Irena.
Leave us, Irena!
In the name of God, leave us in peace.
Come on.
Let's go down the stairs.
Don't, Alice. It's gone. Everything's all right.
Don't be afraid.
I'm not afraid.
Look.
Irena's perfume. Strong, sweet.
I need a drink.
(PHONE RINGING)
Yes?
ALICE: Dr. Judd?
Miss Moore.
Yes.
We've been trying to get you on the phone, Dr. Judd. I called your hotel.
Yes, I know.
That's what I want to talk about. Are you alone?
You'd better leave then. She may be on her way back now.
But she is dangerous, Dr. Judd. I warn you.
Hello?
Hello, Dr. Judd?
Dr. Judd?
I think Irena just came in. He hung up on me.
Come on.
We'll get a taxi.
You're late, aren't you?
I kept my appointment.
You see, I've never believed your story.
I am not afraid of you.
I take you in my arms.
So little, so soft.
The warm perfume in your hair.

Don't be afraid of me, Irena.

Thank you.

You're not supposed to touch anything until the police get here.

We've got to find her.

(TIRES SQUEALING)
She never lied to us.
THERE WAS A FATHER
Father, we're out of shoe polish.
Really?
I'll get some today.
These shoes are worn out. They'll never take a shine.
They're still all right.
The leather's cracked.
They're still wearable. Do you have everything, Ryohei?
You have everything?
Ethics, arithmetic, history, reading, handicrafts.
My abacus!
You see? You're a mess.
Area of a circle?
Radius squared times 3. 14.
Volume of a cone?
Radius squared times 3. 14 times the height.
Divided by three.
Good.
Quadrilateral AEDC is inscribed in a circle, so angle ACD equals angle DEF.
Those are the exterior angles.
Angles AEC and ABC are equal to this angle and this angle.
What are you up to over there?
Yes, Kato.
And above line AC?
Yes, the angles formed above line AC are equal.
But triangle ADC is an isosceles triangle.
Therefore these two angles are equal.
It follows that angles AEC and DEF are also equal.
Did you get that?
Any questions?
That's all for today. Now let's talk about our excursion.
Quiet!
All fourth-year students will go to Tokyo.
First we'll visit the Imperial Palace, then the Meiji and Yasukuni shrines.
Finally, we'll see Kamakura, Enoshima and Hakone.
Ready? Everybody look this way.
And...
Hakone Pass steepest in all Japan Even Kankoku Barrier doesn't compare
The highest mountains The deepest valleys Tower before us hold us up from behind
Mountains circled by clouds valleys choked with mist
The row of cedars Is dark even during the day
The winding path Is soft with moss
It only takes one man To protect it from an army
Manly warriors traveling the land
Swords at their hips clogs on their feet Stomping along Eight miles of boulders
Such were the warriors of old
Looks like a stalemate. What now?
These blisters are huge.
Do they hurt?
Want me to pop them? - No.
Come on!
I said no!
Yamada, how are those blisters?
Fine.
Can you walk?
No problem.
Rub some soap on your socks tomorrow.
What's Hakone famous for?
The steepest cliffs.
Oh, you knew.
I've known it for a long time.
Say, are those our students?
They can't be. I warned them not to go rowing.
Did anybody go out on the lake?
Did anybody go rowing?
We don't know. - Kinoshita?
I don't know, sir.
Sato?
I don't know.
Hey, how much was this?
Fifty sen.
I should've bought one.
I'll sell it to you for 80.
Forget it.
Mr. Horikawa!
What is it?
Yoshida's boat capsized!
What was he doing in a boat?
His family's coming on the night train.
I know how you feel, but please reconsider.
What do you say?
I understand why you feel responsible, but you did your best to watch them.
The boy's family knows that.
I knew it was dangerous, and I warned them.
But if I'd been more insistent, they wouldn't have gotten in those boats.
I know, because they all obey me.
I've taught them for three years. I know them well.
Yoshida wasn't the disobedient kind.
But I wasn't careful enough.
I was negligent.
Don't torment yourself with that kind of thinking.
Thank you for your concern, but I've thought it over and made my decision.
I can understand that.
Anyway, the principal has accepted my resignation.
That can be undone.
Listen, Hirata, let me do it this way.
I don't want to be responsible for other people's children anymore.
It's too frightening.
I can't stop thinking about his parents.
I have a son. I know how they feel.
It's unbearable, suddenly losing a child you've raised for so long.
He leaves to have fun and returns cold as stone, even with a teacher watching over him.
It's unendurable, a sorrow beyond tears.
He'd even bought his mother a souvenir.
I'd hate the teacher.
I'd never trust him with a child again.
This job has become too much for me.
It's terrifying.
I'm just not suited for it.
But you have Ryohei to worry about.
What will you do?
I'll go back to my hometown for a while.
I'll stay with an old friend while I think things over.
I'm back.
Hello. - Welcome back.
Dad, how much farther to Ueda?
About 40 minutes. You tired?
No. Is Ueda a big town?
Yes, it's a city.
What's the population?
About 35,000.
It has an orchid market and a silk-farming school, right?
That's right.
Did you forget to trim your nails?
Keep them trimmed, you hear?
Were you born in that house we saw?
Yes.
Is it still yours? - Not anymore.
Remember the graves we visited?
The one next to your mother's is your grandfather's.
He sold that house to put me through school.
He owned a kimono shop, right?
No, he taught the Chinese classics.
He went to work at the castle every day.
The yard was bigger then, with a persimmon tree.
Let's go see the castle next.
Okay.
Chew your food well.
Ueda's really small, isn't it, Father?
I thought it was bigger.
Well, Kanazawa's much bigger.
It's the largest city on the Sea of Japan.
You don't like this town?
Why?
I'm thinking of settling here.
So we're moving here?
Will you teach junior high here?
No, I won't.
I've been meaning to tell you.
I'm never going to teach again.
What will you do?
I don't know, but there's a temple two miles from here.
An old friend is a priest there.
I think I'll go there.
You're going to be a priest?
No, you have to be much more virtuous for that.
But don't worry.
You'll have to change schools.
Can you do that?
Be patient.
You'll soon make new friends. Schools are all the same.
All right?
I'll be better off here anyway.
Your nickname was "Badger,"
so kids called me "Little Badger." I hated it.
Nobody knows that here.
No, they don't.
How's the job at the town hall going?
Fine, thanks.
A lot of kids are born in this small town.
I registered three births yesterday.
Really?
And most of them survive.
I should have been a midwife.
Where's Ryohei?
Out catching dragonflies with a friend.
So he's making friends?
Unfortunately he likes killing things.
That's all right, as long as he's a kid.
What a beautiful Sunday.
You finished?
No.
Then you can't go fishing tomorrow.
It's just like last night's problem.
You made the same mistake.
You already forgot. It's proportional distribution.
A, B, and C set out.
A will take 12 days, B will take 15.
Oh, I get it.
No, I don't.
You're too restless. Calm down and focus.
You'll never get into a good junior high that way.
You're not focused enough.
I can't help you if you don't get into junior high.
You'll never amount to anything.
Study hard and I'll send you not only to junior high but to any high school you want.
Just relax and concentrate.
I did it!
Good for you.
It's easy if you think carefully.
Good.
Easy, wasn't it?
Get the fishing gear.
Check the line.
Is the float okay like this?
That's fine.
We'll get up early and dig for worms.
There's a lot under the fig tree out back.
Really?
Catch as many as you like.
I don't mind.
I gave them last rites a long time ago. But the fish around here are pretty nimble.
You must be happy that exams are over.
What about that other boy?
Which one?
What's his name?
The son of the soy sauce merchant.
Toshi? He passed.
He did?
Good.
I didn't get question 4.
I was sure I wouldn't pass.
It's all right to miss one.
Ryohei, when you go to junior high, you're going to have to live in the dorm.
In the dorm?
It's too far to commute every day.
I'll be all alone in Ueda?
But I'll come visit you once a week.
Don't mope. You'll get used to it.
Besides, summer vacation will be here soon. You can come see me then.
Hen" is a female chicken?
And "cock" is the male?
Then what's "dog" mean?
Inu.
Male or female?
I don't know.
English is a pain.
Aren't you hungry?
I sure am.
What's that rice with the yellow stuff?
Rice curry?
Yeah. It's good.
Good but hot.
Horikawa, a visitor.
Father, why are you here?
I happened to be in town.
Can you get permission to come out?
Lucky you. You'll probably get spending money.
Nah, he just gave me 50 sen last Sunday.
Be sure to get us something.
Okay.
Your dad came?
Lucky you.
Let's give his father a nickname.
Like what?
How about "Badger"?
Yeah, that's good.
Everyone out to weed!
Again?
They sure grow fast.
This is good. Try some.
Father, today is weeding day.
We have to weed all around the dorm.
So it's unfair that you're here.
I'll get them something to make up for it.
Can you buy them some rice cakes?
No, thanks.
You're full already?
I'm stuffed.
I should've had rice curry. - Want some?
Too late now.
Don't lie down after you eat.
Don't worry.
Father, only 53 more days to go.
Till summer vacation?
Can we go fishing in that river?
Sure.
We can drain the pond and catch a ton.
Can we go every day during the summer?
I'm afraid not, son.
I came to tell you something today.
What?
I've decided to move to Tokyo.
Tokyo?
Great! When?
But you'll continue your studies here.
I've decided to move to Tokyo and try working there.
I don't make enough here to send you to junior high and then higher schools.
I need to work even harder.
I think you're mature enough to understand.
I'll work in Tokyo while you study hard here.
Think of it as a contest between us.
Don't let me win, okay?
I'm still young enough to give you a run for your money.
You can't afford to lose your focus.
No need to cry. There's nothing sad about it.
This isn't good-bye forever.
I'll go to Tokyo and wait for you to get out of school.
Don't worry. We'll be back together soon.
All right?
That's enough crying.
I brought these since I won't see you for a while.
Shirts, shorts, tissue paper, and three pairs of socks.
Alternate the socks, and wash them now and then.
This is cold medicine. Take this one for a stomachache.
Don't drink unboiled water, even in warm weather.
Don't catch a chill when sleeping.
Wrap something around your tummy at night.
Here's some spending money.
Don't waste it.
Be frugal.
I'll write as soon as I get to Tokyo, and you write to me once a week.
We'll keep in touch by mail, just like we do now, all right?
I've included some stamps.
Stop crying now.
It's nearly time to get you back.
When does your teacher want you back?
By 7:00.
Then we still have some time.
Do your best, okay?
Did you call?
More sake, please.
You want rice curry?
Just the sake then.
Ryohei, come here.
It's unbecoming for a man to cry.
Men don't cry.
So your son graduated from high school?
Good for him.
Where will he attend university?
In Sendai.
I thought we'd finally live together in Tokyo, but it wasn't to be.
But it must be exciting to send him off to college.
We'll see...
I just hope he studies hard.
Excuse me.
Mr. Hirata?
Excuse me.
Well, well!
So it is you! It's been a long time.
Fancy meeting you here.
I thought it was you, but I never imagined you'd be in Tokyo.
This really is an odd place to run into you.
Have you been in Tokyo long?
Yes. Do you come here often?
Yes.
I see. I've been coming a lot since last autumn.
I wonder why we didn't meet sooner.
Me too. Well, take care.
I last saw you at the temple in Ueda.
That must have been 13 years ago.
I guess it's been that long.
I didn't know my way around when I got here, but the days went by and I got busier and busier.
I haven't kept in touch with anyone, though I meant to.
We're both guilty of that.
Ah, good.
Just a little something.
Please don't go to any trouble.
Do we have more of this?
I see.
Please.
I'm looking right at you, but I hardly recognize you!
You've grown into a beautiful girl.
How old are you?
Twenty-one.
She only looks grown up.
She's a lovely flower of a girl.
Ah, Seiichi.
Come and say hello.
No.
I said no!
He's always difficult.
That's all right. Children should have some spirit.
That was rude. You should greet guests.
Little dummy.
What?
Money for the movies.
Absolutely not.
Not until you greet our guest.
Come on, Sis.
No.
What are you doing at city hall?
Compiling material on the history of Tokyo. A job you can't do unless you love it.
Have some more.
The perfect job for a washed-up old teacher like me.
Hello there.
What is it?
I'm going to the movies.
That boy's hopeless. How's your Ryohei?
Fine, thanks. He just graduated from Tohoku Imperial University.
He's 25 now.
Is that so?
Where does he work?
He's teaching at a technical school in Akita.
That's good.
Strange, isn't it? I gave up teaching.
I never thought I'd let him become a teacher.
I guess the apple doesn't fall far from the tree.
What's wrong with that?
I envy you.
But aren't you lonely living alone?
No, I got used to it long ago.
We've been apart for a long time.
I thought perhaps this year we'd live together, but no.
You're still healthy.
There'll be other chances.
I suppose so.
I'm sure of it.
We want so much.
You should be happy he's grown up so well.
My children are still babies.
It never changes, no matter how old they get.
I just hope he's doing well.
When you nitrate toluene three times with nitric and sulfuric acids, you get trinitrotoluene, or TNT.
See the three nitrogen dioxide molecules here?
The solid is a yellow color.
It melts at 81° Celsius and combusts if heated to 295°
When it combusts, two moles of TNT decompose to three of nitrogen, five of water, seven of carbon monoxide, and seven carbon atoms.
Its use as an explosive derives from the energy released.
A train.
Seeing it makes me homesick.
I could get home on that train.
If home were a little closer, I could commute to school.
That's a long train.
Makes me want to go home.
Who's dorm master today?
Mr. Horikawa.
You think he'd let me?
You just went home last Saturday.
But I have a new baby brother.
Permission to enter.
Sir.
What is it?
I've written a request to visit home.
Didn't you just go?
Yes, but my mother just had a new baby.
You can't go back to drink your mother's milk.
I would never do that.
How old is your father?
Surely you remember that.
Your older brother was drafted, wasn't he?
How's he doing?
Fine.
Are your parents struggling?
Not at all.
The neighbors help out a lot.
I'm glad to hear that. It's your duty to study hard.
Don't worry about your parents.
All right.
Permission to leave.
Permission to enter.
Yes?
We're planning a trip to Mount Akiba next Sunday.
Will you join us, sir?
I can't next Sunday.
You can't?
You sure?
I'm busy.
Won't you reconsider, sir?
Sorry. I'm going to see my father.
I see.
Still fond of seeing your father, sir?
Yes, I am. That never changes.
Is that so?
Well, that's that.
Yeah, I guess so.
Permission to leave.
Perhaps another time.
This sure feels good.
It does, doesn't it?
Thanks for coming this far.
That's all right. The train wasn't too crowded.
The water here is nicely scented.
I haven't been around here in a long time.
You've put on weight.
Being dorm supervisor agrees with me.
I get up early, and I exercise.
It's good to have regular habits.
How are you, Father?
Excellent.
I've never taken a single sick day.
Really?
You've got more meat on you than I do.
I'll wash your back.
That's all right.
I'll wash yours.
No, I'm fine.
I haven't been here in so long.
I was at Utsunomiya Junior High.
Back when your mother was alive.
You weren't even born yet.
Really?
It sure feels good.
So Mr. Hirata's well too?
He must be getting on.
He's still quite active.
We often play go, though he's better than me.
I'd like to see him again.
You remember his daughter, Fumiko?
I'm not sure.
She was just a little girl this high.
Oh, her!
She sat up straight and had a yellow sash.
She's grown into a beautiful girl.
Really? She was such a crybaby.
Was she?
I drank a lot tonight. It feels good.
You can hold your liquor.
Not at all.
I couldn't drink this much every night, but this is a special occasion.
Do you smoke?
A little.
Just one.
When did you start?
I don't really smoke that much.
Good. Better not to. These things will make you stupid.
Is that right?
Father...
I've given it some thought.
I've decided to quit my job.
Why?
To move to Tokyo.
Why?
Don't you like your job?
It's not that.
But with me working there, who knows when I'll be able to move to Tokyo.
Ever since junior high, I've wanted us to live together.
I thought maybe after I graduated, but I wound up in Akita.
I can't stand living apart like this.
You sacrificed so much for my education, so I know it's selfish to say this, but I want to work in Tokyo and be with you.
What do you think?
There are jobs in Tokyo these days.
Out of the question.
I want to be with you too, but our duty is to do our jobs.
No matter what the job is, you must consider it your calling.
We all have a job to do... and we must do it to the very best of our ability.
There's no room for personal feelings.
Do your best. Work all you can.
You'll keep up in the world that way.
Sometimes work is tedious.
Lasting happiness only arises from the alternation of pleasure and pain."
Work isn't worthwhile if it isn't hard.
You're only happy when you see it through.
Stop being selfish. Let go of the self altogether.
You can't do your job with such a nonchalant attitude, especially in a profession as crucial as yours.
Those parents have made great sacrifices to send their boys to your school.
Shaping them should be your prime concern.
Your every action is an example for them.
That's not a responsibility to be taken lightly.
I failed in that responsibility, so I'm asking you to succeed.
Do your duty for both of us.
I want you to give it your all.
We can meet occasionally like this.
Isn't that enough?
Isn't life more enjoyable when we both work as hard as we can?
Isn't it? Isn't this enough?
You understand?
Do the best you can.
What a pity.
I wish we had more time to fish.
We should have gone fishing yesterday afternoon.
Time flies.
We barely meet and it's time to say good-bye.
That's right.
We waited a long time for this chance.
At least we had a night to talk.
I really enjoyed it.
When is your train?
Not for a while.
At any rate, we'll meet again soon.
Take care of yourself. Don't get sick.
At a time like this, you must do your part.
I will.
Take good care.
Father... some spending money.
Spending money? For me?
It's not much, but please take it.
I wasn't sure I should.
It's such a small amount.
Should I really take it?
Please do.
Thank you.
I'll offer it at your mother's altar when I get back.
Thank you.
Father, I'm sorry about last night.
I was being selfish.
I went a little too far, but I'm glad you understood.
Please do your best.
Now is no time for idleness.
I've still got a lot left in me.
Let's both do our best.
Yes, absolutely.
Don't forget anything.
The bush warblers are singing.
You have visitors, sir.
Mr. Kurokawa? For me?
Show them in.
It's been a long time, sir.
I'm Yasutaro Kurokawa. You taught me at Kanazawa Junior High.
Is that right?
And I'm Minoru Uchida.
Well, I'll be! Have a seat.
You're looking well, sir. - Thanks.
You're looking well yourselves.
Sit down. Thank you.
It's been quite a while.
We ran into Mr. Hirata yesterday.
He told us about you.
Is that right?
He told us all about you, sir.
Did he now?
How you two play go.
He was my go partner back in our teaching days.
Then I ran into him here, and we started playing again.
I'll bet you're good, sir.
No, far from it.
Some of our old schoolmates are here in Tokyo, and we're planning a party in honor of you and Mr. Hirata.
We can reminisce about the old days.
We'd be honored if you'd attend.
I'd be happy to.
What day would be convenient?
Mr. Hirata said any day is fine.
Same for me. I'd be glad to come.
Really?
The sooner the better.
How about Saturday or next Wednesday?
Let's see.
Which do you prefer, sir?
Wednesday's best for me.
Can we make it then?
Is that best?
You see, my son's coming on Saturday.
Is that right? I heard he's in Akita.
Is that Ryohei?
He must be grown up by now.
How old is he?
He's 25.
Welcome.
I'm back.
Master Ryohei is here.
Really?
Welcome home.
When did you get in?
An hour ago.
I thought it'd be tomorrow or the day after.
Didn't you plan to stop over in Ueda?
Yes, the priest offered to let me stay.
Why didn't you?
I wanted to come home as soon as possible.
I see. How is he?
Quite well.
He gave me some cigarettes for you.
That's nice.
Still fond of his tea.
Did you pass your physical for the draft?
You passed? Good.
Go tell your mother.
I'm so relieved.
You were sickly as a child. I'm glad you grew out of it.
You're a strong young man.
How long can you stay?
I have ten days off.
Long enough for us to have a good time.
You look younger than before.
Do I?
You still have it.
My bald patch?
You remember? - I fell from the porch.
Will you take a bath?
You go first.
Are you sure?
If you insist.
I'll take one later.
Please get my cotton kimono for Ryohei.
We'll have dinner after our bath.
Mr. Hirata, remember how you punished Iwamoto and me for fighting in third grade?
I'm afraid I don't.
Isn't that right?
That was an awful day.
You made us stand at attention and then forgot to dismiss us.
Mr. Horikawa, you used to scold me a lot too.
You were always dozing off in class.
Now he's famous for dozing off at work.
Give him a talking-to, sir.
He'll never change.
Get off my back.
I'd like to say a few words.
We're deeply grateful that both of you could spare your valuable time tonight.
More than 10 years have passed since our graduation, and nothing could be more enjoyable for us than being here together this evening.
We take this opportunity to ask you both for your continued guidance.
Please eat and drink to your heart's content.
Let's enjoy ourselves like in the old days.
I'd like to say something.
Two more classmates were expected this evening, but Sasaki was called away on business.
I'll read it for you:
Delighted you're both in good health. Hope reunion is a success."
And Nakanishi called to announce the birth of his baby boy earlier this evening.
Mother and baby are fine. He'll try to make it a little later.
Wonderful news.
Cheers!
It was kind of you to put together this wonderful reunion.
We're deeply grateful.
Nothing makes us happier than to see you all as healthy and active as ever.
Years ago you dubbed me "Badger."
But this badger is old now.
Now it's time for me to ask you for your help and guidance.
I sincerely hope you will all enjoy good health, exert yourselves to the fullest, and succeed in your chosen professions.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to you all.
Mr. Horikawa said everything I intended to say.
No less than "Badger" here, this old "Chicken" before you now asks for your favor.
It's been so long, sir.
I never expected to see you in Tokyo.
Another, sir?
You've grown into a fine young man. Are you married yet?
Yes indeed.
Most of us are, right?
Is that a fact?
Everybody, raise your hand if you're married.
We're the only bachelors here.
It appears so.
Raise your hand if you have a child.
Congratulations. Two children?
Anyone with three?
It's a little soon to have three.
Just a minute!
I have four.
Congratulations.
Time flies doesn't it, Mr. Horikawa?
They all have children already.
Time does fly.
May I, sir?
One more, sir?
No, thank you. I've had enough.
Just one more.
Life's so unpredictable.
It certainly is.
It's been over ten years since you quit over that accident, and now you're here having fun with everyone.
That's right.
Do you still make offerings at Yoshida's grave every year?
I heard something to that effect back home.
I do what I can, out of remorse.
That remorse says a lot.
I still see you all as you were back then.
I know what you mean. Strange, isn't it?
Mr. Hirata, when I resigned my position, you held a party for me.
I remember.
I often recall that night.
The primroses were in full bloom along the river.
Yes, they were.
I was deeply moved... by the Chinese poem you recited.
You recite poetry, sir?
And very well.
We'd like to hear some.
Yes, please!
Please, sir.
Listen, everyone.
If you insist...
Welcome.
Sorry to be so late.
Welcome back.
You're still up?
How was the party?
I thoroughly enjoyed it.
I'm glad.
My former pupils are now all fine young men.
I'm just grateful they still remember me, though I wasn't much of a teacher.
They were extremely kind and thought of everything.
It was a very nice evening.
Were there many there?
Yes, and they were all glad to hear the news about you.
Really?
You have to work as hard as they do.
We should all do our best in everything we do.
What do you think of Mr. Hirata's daughter?
What do you mean?
What would you say to marrying her?
I'm still too young.
I think Fumiko's a fine girl.
Mr. Hirata brought it up.
Don't be so shy.
You can read that book later.
What do you say?
Or is there someone else?
No.
Then marry her.
You passed your physical with flying colors, and single life is hard out in the country.
Well? I would if I were you.
All right. I'll leave it in your hands.
You will?
She'll make a good, hard-working wife.
She's the type I've always wanted for you.
I'm so relieved.
And very drunk.
Would you get me some water?
I feel wonderful.
Where are you off to today?
I'm going to buy a book.
Again?
I need a certain chemistry text.
I found one last time, but it was soiled and worn.
I'm going to look for a nicer copy today.
Visit the museum in Ueno as well.
They have many fine pieces.
Really?
Where else can you see so many nice things for 10 sen?
There's a Kazan Watanabe exhibit right now.
Really?
You should go.
When you see his paintings, you'll understand the profound beauty of traditional Japanese art.
I'll have a look.
By the way, I've invited Mr. Hirata over tonight.
Try to be home for that, all right?
Master Ryohei, something's wrong with your father.
Father, what's wrong?
What happened?
I'm in a little pain.
Are you all right?
I'm fine.
Why don't you stay home today?
No, I'm fine.
I've never missed a day of work.
Father.
Call the doctor.
Help me get these clothes off.
I feel kind of strange.
Father!
Father.
Can you hear me?
Mr. Hirata's here.
Kind of you to come.
Mr. Horikawa... try to hold on.
Thank you.
Fumiko... please look after Ryohei for me.
That's my wish.
Father.
I feel good.
I'm sleepy... very sleepy.
Be strong.
It's nothing to be sad about.
I did the very best I could.
I'm happy.
Father!
Time of death: 3:16. There was nothing more I could do.
Ryohei, don't cry.
Your father died with dignity.
Only those who did their very best while alive can die with that kind of dignity.
Mr. Horikawa was a great man.
You were lucky to have him as a father.
You hear me? Don't cry.
I wonder if my little brother is asleep by now.
I'm sure he misses you.
And your father will be helpless without you.
Shall we ask them to come live with us in Akita?
It'll be a lively household.
I think so too.
I wanted to live with my father since I was a little kid.
Unfortunately he died before that could happen.
But it's all right. At least we had a week together.
It was the best week of my life.
He was a good father.
This is the story of a ship
Ship's company...'shun! Turn aft, right and left.
Turn!
Open fire!
Open fire!
Shoot!
Look at the Huns, sir. They're jumping overboard in full marching order.
Look at that. Come in, the water's lovely! Look at'em.
Somebody must have blown a whistle.
Layer on.
There are a lot more caïques to port, sir, and some bigger transports.
Shift to the big transports.
Aye aye, sir. Check, check, check. Shift target right.
Can I fire torpedoes at the transports?
All right, get your old mouldies off, but not more than two at any transport.
Flags, make to the division.
Train tubes to port.
Ready port. - Main office, make Tommy Tommy port.
That's got'em! Shoot when you see the whites of their eyes.
0-3-5. 1-0 left
Bingo!
Fire one! - Fire one!
Fire two! - Fire two!
Torpedoes fired, sir.
Our fish have hit, sir, and one transport has blown up.
There goes another. Big stuff. The rest of the division are doing well.
Must be an enemy destroyer, sir.
Right, engage her.
Aye aye, sir.
Check check check. Shift target left Follow TBI.
Take this. It was my mother's.
Trainer on.
Layer on.
Left gun ready.
Right gun ready.
0-4-0. 1-0 left.
I'll lay you 10-1 they're all Germans.
You'd never get the Macaronis to tackle a job like that, not for love nor money.
The Eyeties will do anything for money.
Anything but fight. That's why they were so lousy in the last war.
That's on account of their warm, languorous southern temperament.
Cocoa, sir.
Thanks, Snotty.
Thank you.
Here comes the dawn of a new day, Flags. It could be an uncomfortable one.
Yes, sir. It's a very pretty sky, sir. Somebody sent me a calendar rather like that.
Did it have a squadron of Dorniers on it? - No, sir.
That's where art parts company with reality.
You're right, sir.
Cigarette?
Thanks.
Aircraft in sight astern, sir. Angle of sight 2-0.
Looks like a couple of squadrons of Junkers 88's.
Starboard 20.
Aye aye, sir.
Starboard 20. - One blast on the siren.
Aye aye, sir.
Aircraft in sight, bearing green 1-7-0.
Angle of sight 2-0.
Short-range weapons.
Aircraft in sight. Stand by for dive bombers.
Open fire!
Shoot.
The first wave are diving now.
Hard a-port.
Sound two blasts.
Aye aye, sir.
All guns, sector independent.
Down, everybody
Hard a-starboard.
We got one. Try and get two next time.
Bravo! All guns shift to the next wave.
Red 1-4-0.
Short-range weapons.
Shift to the next wave.
Bearing red 1-4-0.
Hard a-starboard.
Hard a-starboard.
Sound one blast.
Aye aye, sir.
We've winged that one.
Down, everybody!
Midships.
Aye aye, sir. Midships.
There's another wave on the port side, sir.
Hard a-starboard.
The leader of this wave is coming much lower, sir.
He'll probably hit our mast.
Well done. We've got him, but I'm afraid he's got us too.
Midships.
Midships, sir. Carry on firing.
Here comes the next wave.
All guns are still in action.
Stop both.
No answer from the engine room, sir. The telegraphs must be shot away.
I'm afraid we're going over. Pass the word to cast loose the Carley floats.
Abandon ship!
I'll sign for her now I'lll sign for her now. I'll sign for her now I'll sign for her now.
Has Satterthwaite been sighted?
No, sir, but it's just on ten o'clock.
Stop that hammering, Edgecombe. I can't hear myself think.
Aye aye. sir
Tell No.1 to fall in the hands on the quarterdeck.
Shall we have it on the desk or the shelf, sir?
Shelf. We'll have the usual one on the desk.
Wedding dress, sir? - Yes.
It's here, sir.
Good. Give it to me.
Mr Satterthwaite's coming on board, sir.
Is No.1 bringing him down?
Hands all aft?
Mr Satterthwaite, sir.
Good morning.
Good morning.
Everything in order?
Certainly.
We'd better get this little ceremony over.
Were you satisfied with the trial?
Yes, she's a well-found ship.
We'll be hoisting the ensign in a couple of minutes, Edgecombe.
Now, then.
Are you prepared to take over the ship, sir?
Yes, I'll sign for her now.
Watch your head, sir. Watch your head, sir.
Watch your head, sir.
You can smoke if you like.
Thank you, sir.
Will you have one, sir?
No, thanks, not at the moment.
Heard from your missus?
I had a letter last week. - One of the usuals, full of complaints.
What's wrong?
Her mother was took bad and had to go to hospital.
That old woman's always in trouble. I think she enjoys it.
What's the matter with her?
Last time it was her back, this time it's her stomach.
It seems she can't keep anything down. It's not for want of trying.
You'll be glad to be going to sea.
To put it mildly, sir!
Darling!
I thought you were never coming.
Everything under control?
Far from it. We've been in an uproar all day since your telegram came.
Daddy!
Hello, Bobby.
We've been waiting for hours.
Mummy wanted us to go to bed.
We saw the ship, Daddy.
We took our tea on the cliffs and saw it go by.
Not "it", Lavvy. Her.
That's right.
She looked beautiful, Teddy.
How fast was she going?
Was it 40 knots?
Good heavens, no. She was only doing 20.
But she can do more than that, can't she?
You bet she can.
Take the car round.
Then give Ellen a hand with dinner.
Good evening, Edgecombe.
Evening ma'am.
I hope it's a good dinner. I'm starving.
Can I tell him what it is, Mummy?
It's a surprise. She mustn't spoil it.
Bobby, keep still. How long have you got?
Till the morning.
Can we come to the dockyard?
No, son. We're commissioning, making a rush job of it.
But Mummy promised...
That's enough. You heard Daddy.
But we shall be able to come on board before you go, shan't we?
Well, we'll make time somehow.
When, Daddy? When?
Bobby, don't be so persistent. Children, it's dreadfully late. You really will have to go to bed.
Oh, Mummy.
Daddy will come up and say good night if you're quick.
But I want to hear about the ship.
I'll tell you about it in the morning.
You can fire as many questions as you like. Be good, do as your mother tells you, and go to bed.
Can I ask questions, too?
You never do anything else. Go on.
Off you go, both of you. - I'll be up in ten minutes.
Promise.
Promise?
Are you coming up, too, Mummy?
Yes.
Come on, Lavvy, I'll race you.
Wait. That's not fair!
They've been wild with excitement all day.
Darling, you must be exhausted. I'll get you a drink. Whisky and soda or a cocktail?
As it's a gala evening, let's have a Kinross special.
I guessed it. It's all ready, only wants the ice.
I made a private bet that you'd forget the Cointreau.
Wrong again. I had a sort of feeling this was an occasion.
Were the trials satisfactory? Were you pleased?
More than pleased.
She's a lovely ship. Does what she's told without a murmur.
Why are you making a rush job of the commissioning?
I like getting things done quickly.
Is that the only reason?
We're living in strange times, darling. It's as well to be prepared.
Yes, I suppose it is.
It's nothing to worry about.
No, of course not. Here, try this. It may be a bit too sweet.
My love.
My love.
Just right, not a bit too sweet. Miss me?
Of course not. I never gave you a thought.
What's the surprise for dinner?
Grouse. Maureen sent us a brace from Scotland.
There's a girl of fine perception.
They're a bit high, but I expect you'll like that.
Is that a new dress?
Oh, no, darling. I've had it for ages.
I swear I've never clapped eyes on it before.
Only about 20 times, my love.
Perhaps it's you that looked new. As good as new, anyway.
Is there going to be a war, do you think?
Yes, I think there is.
Oh. No good worrying about it till it comes. Not much good then, really.
No.
Don't be sad.
I'm not sad, really. I'm just sort of... gathering myself together.
Any more Kinross special left in the shaker?
Yes, of course.
However busy you are, and however quickly you've got to get your commissioning done,
I should like to come on board just once before you go to sea to give the ship my love. You'll have to.
My cabin's got to be made presentable.
Is the chintz all right? - First class.
Good.
We'd better drink these up quickly and go up to the children.
Dinner will be ready in a minute. Here we go.
Here we go.
Swim to the float. Swim to the float.
I've got some brandy in my Gieves.
Kath.
Kath. Kath.
Here's the paper, dear.
I shan't have time to do more than look at the headlines.
There you are, then.
It don't look too good, does it?
Oh, you can't believe anything they say. Look at all the fuss we had last year.
Everybody flying about in aeroplanes and making speeches. After all that, nothing happened.
Nothing happened to us, but a hell of a lot happened to other people.
Do you really think we'll have another war? Looks like it.
Well, I'll believe it when I see it.
You may see it quicker than you bargained for.
I don't believe that Hitler'd be so silly.
What would he expect to gain by having a war?
World domination, that's what that little rat's after.
They haven't got enough to eat in Germany as it is.
Mrs Blacket's nephew, the one that travels in underwear, came back from Berlin two months ago.
He said they was all half-starved.
I can't help what Mrs Blacket's nephew says. I think we're for it.
Well, if we have another war, I give up, see, after all we went through last time.
All you went through?
You was too young and innocent to know about anything. Don't talk so silly.
You know perfectly well how old I am, so don't pretend you don't.
You'll always be young and innocent to me.
Will I indeed, now?
If you ask me, you've got a hangover from all that beer you put away last night.
I must be going. - Is Mother coming down?
I promised I'd call her. Wait a minute.
Mother? Walter's just going. - You'd better come down as you are.
That will be nice.
Will you get ashore after commissioning? Before you go to sea, I mean.
That all depends. Don't forget to put those bulbs in when the time comes.
You and your bulbs! - Goodbye, old girl.
Walter Hardy, whatever is the matter with you? Anyone would think you was going away for ever.
You never know.
You ought be ashamed of yourself, saying that.
Here comes Mother.
That spirit lamp of mine will be the death of me yet.
What's the matter with it? It blew up again.
Frightened the wits out of me.
You will put in too much methylated.
What do you want to go fussing about with spirit lamps in your bedroom for?
You could pop down to the kitchen. Nobody'd notice.
I've made my own tea in my own bedroom all my life. I don't see any reason to stop now.
Yes, but that doesn't happen to be your own bedroom. It's my spare.
If you go on blowing things up in it, it won't be fit to sleep in.
Stop it, you two. I've got to go now.
A nice thing, when my own daughter starts criticising me.
Oh, shut up, Mother. Say goodbye to Walter. That's what you came down for.
Will you get ashore again?
All depends on Hitler.
Who does he think he is, anyway? That's the spirit!
Goodbye, Mother. Look after Kath for me.
Don't you two go nagging each other from morning to night.
Nagging? I like that, I must say.
Come on, Kath.
Goodbye, old girl.
Goodbye, dear.
Ship's company...'shun.
Ship's company present, sir.
Thanks, No.1.
Stand them at ease.
Ship's company, stand at... ease.
Break ranks and gather round me.
Can you hear me all right at the back?
Aye aye, sir.
It's the custom for the captain to address the ship's company on Commissioning Day to give them his policy and tell them the ship's programme.
Now, my policy's easy. If there are any here who've served with me before, they'll know it.
Are there any old shipmates of mine here?
Oh, glad to see you again, Reynolds. And Adams. And Blake.
Who's the small fellow behind the chief stoker? Parkinson, sir.
Coxswain of the All Comers whaler in the Valletta?
I was that, sir, when we won the cup in the 1936 regatta.
And fell into the ditch when you got to the ship.
Well, there are enough old shipmates to tell the others what my policy's always been.
Reynolds, Adams, Blake, Coombe, Parkinson, what sort of a ship do I want the Torrin to be?
A happy ship, sir. - That's right.
An efficient ship, sir.
Correct.
A happy and efficient ship. A very happy and a very efficient ship.
You might think I'm ambitious wanting both, but in my experience, you can't have one without the other.
A ship can't be happy unless she's efficient, and won't be efficient unless she's happy. Now for our programme.
You've seen the commissioning programme published in Plymouth General Orders.
And you will have noted that this allows the company three weeks.
Well, you've all read your papers. Ribbentrop signed a non -aggression pact with Stalin yesterday.
As I see it, that means war next week.
So I will give you not three weeks but exactly three days to get this ship ready to sail.
None of us will turn in or take our clothes off or sling our hammocks till the job's finished.
Then we'll send Hitler a telegram saying, "The Torrin's ready. You can start your war."
You four bring in the sugar, you six gas masks, and I'll join you and bring in the rum.
Wake up, England. You've had your hour. It's my turn now.
Here is an announcement. At 11:15, that is, in about two minutes, the Prime Minister will broadcast to the nation.
Please stand by.
I am speaking to you from the Cabinet Room at 10 Downing Street.
This morning, the British Ambassador in Berlin handed the German government a final note stating that unless we heard from them by 11 o'clock that they were prepared at once to withdraw their troops from Poland, a state of war would exist between us.
I have to tell you now that no such undertaking has been received and that consequently this country is at war with Germany.
You can imagine what a bitter blow it is to me...
It ain't exactly a bank holiday for us.
She's still afloat.
Yes, sir.
God bless this ship and all who sail in her. God bless this ship and all who sail in her.

Them kids have been at it all day. Beats me why their mothers let'em do it.
Oh, it's the Christmas spirit, Mum.
I'll give'em Christmas spirit, coming home with their feet sopping, getting colds.
This is the time for goodwill towards all men. Can't have you grumbling as if it was an ordinary day.
Me grumble? Well, I like that, I must say.
I remember in the last war spending Christmas in the Red Sea.
We was coming home from Aden. Hot? You could have fried an egg on the deck.
The Red Sea is hot, all right. So's the Persian Gulf. I was out there two years ago.
The fridge went wonky and everything went bad, including the language.
You certainly see life in the big ships.
We don't do so badly in the small ones. Oh they're off again.
Stop'em somebody.
I'm not starting anything.
It's a darned sight more lively in a big cruiser. It stands to reason.
It don't do no such thing. You're a Marine. You don't know nothing about destroyers.
What's the matter with the Marines?
Well, Bert, I'm afraid I'll have to tell you.
Where would the Navy be without us?
Without a Navy, there wouldn't be no Marines.
Oh, shut up, you two. Who cares anyway?
That's a nice way to talk, and no mistake! You, the mother of a sailor.
And the mother-in -law of a Marine.
Pass the port wine and don't talk so silly.
I'm as dry as a bone. - Mum's right.
What's the sense in arguing?
We was only having a friendly discussion.
You'll be saying next it was a friendly discussion last night in the Green Man.
Why, you had the whole place in an uproar! Bert, I give you a toast.
The Royal Marines - God bless'em and a happy Christmas to every man jack of 'em.
The Royal Marines.
Thanks, Shorty, old man. I respond to your toast in a fitting manner.
On behalf of my corps, of which I am justly proud... Hear, hear.
I give you destroyers, and the Torrin in particular.
May her shadow never grow less.
It never will.
Destroyers and HMS Torrin.
I should like to take the opportunity of this festive occasion to drink the healths of one and all present, and to thank a kindly fate for so arranging that my ship should have to come home for boiler cleaning two days before Christmas -
a bit of luck which any sailor would tell you is little short of a bloody miracle.
Walter, how can you? You know I don't like you using that word.
Be that as it may, Kath, that's a highly expressive word.
It's been bound up with naval tradition since times immemorial.
I have heard it whispered in the RAF.
Well, be that as it may, I would like to add that I consider we're all... very lucky... to be together on this happy day, taking into account there's a war on and civilisation happens to be trembling on the edge of an abyss.
There, now.
What did you say, Kath?
I only said, "There, now." Well, don't say it again.
You know it only puts me off.
What are you giggling about, Freda, if I may make so bold?
Nothing, really. It's just the way you talk.
What you young flibbertigibbets don't realise is that this is a very important war indeed.
War or no war, you certainly like listening to the sound of your own voice.
Oh, let him get on with his speech, Kath.
Try and stop him.
I will treat these paltry interruptions with the contempt they deserve, and go on to propose the health of one who is very dear to me.
She's a creature of many moods and fads and fancies.
She is, to coin a phrase, very often uncertain and coy and hard to please.
But I'm devoted to her with every fibre in my being, and I hereby swear to be true to her in word and deed, so help me God.
Ladies and gentlemen, HMS Torrin. HMS Torrin.
Ladies and gentlemen, the King.
The King.
We can smoke now, can't we? - Yes, of course.
You promised to pull the first one with me.
Take a strong grip and pull.
Come on, old girl. - Enjoying yourself?
Very, very much.
That cap's absolutely wizard. You ought to have a hat made like it.
Doesn't the tree look sweet?
Alix and I spent hours fixing it.
This is the best Christmas I've ever had. - Is it?
Stop whispering, you two.
You really oughtn't to have put them next to each other.
We ought to drink to them. Come on, everybody. To the newly betrothed.
The newly betrothed.
What's betrothed, Daddy?
The beginning of the end, my boy.
On behalf of my fiancée and myself, thank you very kindly.
As Flags and Maureen are so bashful, I think that you should make a speech, Alix.
Oh, no, honestly, I couldn't.
Come on, Alix. I'll support you.
Oh, Teddy, I shall never forgive you for this.
Oh, dear!
What am I to say? Just you wait. - Happy Christmas.
Come on, now.
Silence, everybody.
The Lady Mayoress is about to declare the bazaar open. Don't let him get you down, Alix.
Ladies and gentlemen, I'll begin by taking my husband's advice...
Hooray!
...and wishing you all a very happy Christmas.
I'm sure Elizabeth and June will back me up when I say I am going to deliver, on behalf of all wretched naval wives, a word of warning to Maureen, who has been unwise enough to decide to join our ranks.
Hear hear!
Dear Maureen, we all wish you every possible happiness, but I think it only fair to tell you in advance exactly what you are in for.
Shame, shame.
Speaking from bitter experience,
I can only say that the wife of a sailor is most profoundly to be pitied.
To begin with, her home life, what there is of it, has no stability whatever.
She can never really settle down.
She moves through a succession of other people's houses, flats and furnished rooms.
She finds herself having to grapple with domestic problems in Bermuda, Malta or Weymouth.
We will not deal with the question of pay. That is altogether too painful.
What we will deal with is the most important disillusionment of all.
And that is...
Stop her, somebody. This is rank mutiny.
And that is, that wherever she goes, there is always in her life a permanent and undefeated rival.
Her husband's ship.
Whether it be a battleship or a sloop, a submarine or a destroyer, it holds first place in his heart.
It comes before wife, home, children, everything.
Some of us try to fight this and get badly mauled in the process.
Others, like myself, resign themselves to the inevitable.
That is what you will have to do, my poor Maureen.
That is what we all have to do if we want any peace of mind at all.
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you my rival.
It's extraordinary that anyone could be so fond... and so proud of their most implacable enemy.
This ship. God bless this ship, and all who sail in her.
Well... she did her stuff, sir.
Best ship I ever served in, sir. That goes for me too, sir.
It makes one feel sort of lost, doesn't it?
A very happy and a very efficient ship, sir. Thank you.
Wipe your face, Edgecombe. You don't want oil fuel in your eyes.
Aye aye, sir.
Well... do you know what I'd like now? Anice hot cup of tea. I'd like a nice beer myself.
Look out!
Here come the bastards back again.
Keep your heads down, get as low as you can!
Missed, butterfingers!
Blimey.
I spoke too soon.
Did it get you badly?
Don't rightly know, sir.
Knife, somebody.
Cut his sleeve carefully.
Hit a mother with a baby in her arms, you would.
Oh, look, boys.
Shot through the heart.
I always did hate the sight of blood.
Give us a rag, somebody.
What's your name? What's your name? What's your name?
What's your name?
Quite a loving cup, isn't it?
You never know your luck. I always say travel broadens the mind.
Now then, saucy.
You keep your hands to yourself.
Want a drop, dear?
No, thanks. Come on.
It won't hurt you.
I'd rather not, thanks all the same. I don't like it.
Oh, fancy that, now! Ever so sorry, I'm sure.
If she doesn't want it, she doesn't have to have it.
Who do you think you are, anyway? Father Flanagan?
Here, play a hymn, there's a dear. I didn't know we was in Sunday school.
Some people don't know when they've had enough.
What was that you said? You heard.
You ain't got cloth ears. Here, miss, you change places with me.
It's all right, really.
You'll be more comfortable in the corner.
I'd be ever so much obliged, I'm sure, if you'd change places with me, too.
My mother always warned me never to sit next to sailors.
Pity she didn't warn you about a few other things while she was at it. Ah, shut up arguing, pal.
Here, have a fag.
Life's too short.
Comfy?
Yes, thanks.
What's your name? Freda.
Freda Lewis. Freda?
It's a pretty name, isn't it?
Is it? - Do you mind if I smoke?
Of course not.
Have one?
I don't mind.
These are special, HM ships only. We get'em in the canteen.
My uncle by marriage is in the Navy. He's on a destroyer.
Isn't that a coincidence, now? So am I.
He's a petty officer. They call him by a funny name.
We often call petty officers funny names.
It begins with a B. - It generally does.
Oh, you are awful!
What's his ship?
I'm not supposed to tell you that, am I? It's careless talk.
You can tell me. I'm in the same firm, as you might say.
Well, chief buffer, that's what he's called. He's on the Torrin.
Well, it's a small world, and no error! Here, Joey.
Our chief buffer's her uncle by marriage.
Makes you sort of Siamese twins.
This is my friend Joey Mackeridge. Miss Lewis. - How do you do?
Pleased to meet you, I'm sure
What's your name?
Funny us meeting like that, wasn't it? - Yes.
Sort of... unexpected.
Yes.
That long train, all them people in it, and I had to pick on that one carriage.
It's fate, I shouldn't wonder.
Yeah, I feel that way, too.
I suppose we ought really to be going now.
Yeah, I suppose we ought.
Your family will be wondering what's happened to you.
Well, I'm wondering that myself.
How can you? Does er...
Does your aunt let you go out much?
She doesn't mind, so long as I don't get back too late.
What about tomorrow? We might go to the Palais de Danse. - Do you like dancing?
Yes.
Well, that's a date, then. 6.30, under the clock, Victoria Station.
You don't waste much time, do you?
I can't afford to. I've only got weekend leave.
That's not long.
Well, here we are. Come in and meet my mum and dad. No, not now.
I'd really rather not.
I've got to be getting along. And they wouldn't want a stranger butting in.
You're not a stranger, not any more.
Ah, but to them I would be. Give me that bag, there's a dear.
Not until you say it's OK about tomorrow night.
Oh, you are awful!
6.30, under the clock, Victoria Station.
All right.
Cross your heart and hope to die?
I cross my heart and hope to die.
So long, Freda. - So long, Shorty.
Mum.
Shorty Blake!
You ought to be ashamed of yourself, and no mistake.
Your telegram only arrived half an hour ago.
You never said what time you was coming. I'm here, aren't I?
Sound in wind and limb. You can't grumble.
Oh, you bad boy, you!
May, Shorty's home!
Dad! Dad!
Doesn't he look well?
How's the war going, son?
See any submarines? Hundreds.
Sunk 14 last week, and a couple of cruisers thrown in.
Oh, Mum, he's fibbing, isn't he?
In the last war, I was in a convoy once.
Put a sock in it, Fred. We've heard quite enough about all what you did in the last war.
Dad? - Yes, old man?
Where did you first meet Mum?
Why, whatever made you think of asking that?
We was in a train coming back from Herne Bay.
Well, it's a small world, and no error!
Mum, can I leave my bridge out while Shorty's home?
It was fate, wasn't it?
You drink your tea up, my lad, and don't talk so soft.
They're coming over again.
Get down. Keep your heads low.
Now, nice and still, everybody, please. Steady. A nice smile.
It seems only yesterday he was in his pram. Hold it!
Goodbye, Ma.
Goodbye, Shorty. - Goodbye.
Take care of yourself.
Goodbye, Shorty.
Goodbye, Kath.
Here's your little lot. Now, then.
Cheerio... Mrs Blake.
Oh, it does sound funny, doesn't it?
You'll get used to it.
There's one thing I shall never get used to, and that's you going away.
It's your own fault for marrying a sailor.
That's fairly asking for trouble, that is. Can't trust any of 'em an inch.
Wives in every port. Coming home unexpected and catching you having tea with the lodger.
I'm the one that will be the lodger if I'm going to live with Kath.
That isn't for a whole week yet. Think of it. Seven whole days of glorious life.
You'll like being with Kath, won't you? Of course I shall.
It's you being away and me wondering what's happening to you that I won't like.
Proceed with the following operations: - Give us a kiss.
Chuck us another of Mum's sandwiches. - Cheer up and remember this a honeymoon. - Give us another kiss.
Now, then, ship's company...'shun!
Oh, lay off, Shorty! You're crushing my blouse. - Someone will see us.
Who cares?
Hello, Blake. What are you doing here?
I'm on my honeymoon, sir.
That's splendid. Congratulations.
Thank you, sir. This is my wife, Mrs Blake. - How do you do?
Pleased to meet you, I'm sure.
Alix, come and meet my shipmate and his wife. They've just been married.
Ordinary Seaman Blake, Mrs Blake - my wife.
How do you do?
I hope you'll be very happy.
Thanks ever so.
But we're old friends. He practically saved my life when I came on board.
My foot slipped on the gangway, and I nearly fell overboard.
Do you remember?
Yes, ma'am.
Will you live in Plymouth?
Yes... that is, when he goes to sea again.
Chief Petty Officer Hardy's her uncle by marriage, sir. She's going to live at their place for the duration.
But we're spending the next few days in Torquay. Very nice, too.
You begin as you intend to go on, Mrs Blake. Keep him in order.
My wife rules me with a rod of iron. It's been quite successful so far.
Don't talk such nonsense. I'm never allowed to have my own way.
Well, we won't interrupt you any longer. Report him to me if he doesn't behave.
Goodbye. The very best of luck.
Thanks very much.
Goodbye.
Goodbye for the present, sir.
Have a good time. Enjoy your leave.
Thank you, sir.
Coincidence them going to Torquay for their honeymoon.
I thought that at the time, but I didn't want to go on about it.
That first quarrel we had, remember?
When you went stamping off to listen to the band and came back in tears.
It was only because they were playing The Blue Danube. That always makes me feel pent-up and emotional.
That wasn't why you were in tears. Don't pretend it was.
If I was in tears at all, which I hotly deny, it was because that was when I discovered what a disagreeable character you have.
Still, it was a good honeymoon, as honeymoons go. It went awfully quickly.
Stop it, Teddy. I refuse to be made sentimental in the middle of a Great Western lunch.
Eat up your delicious piece of railway fish and behave yourself.
Damn!
What's the matter?
That thing positively haunts me.
I'd have given my eyeteeth for a show like that. Never mind, darling.
There'll be lots of other shows and lots of other chances before the war's over.
Some damned poet at some time or other wrote a very appealing little piece about "the tiny feet of the rain".
There's a man I'd like to meet. I'd kill him.
Well, I'm going down to the wardroom. Keep a stiff upper lip, old boy.
Five on six, two on three, and ten - just what the doctor ordered.
The Doctor hasn't ordered a damn thing, apart from a few doses of Cascara and one splint since the ship commissioned.
That, I may say, is what's getting the Doctor down.
Years of expensive medical training resulting in complete atrophy.
The doctor wishes he was dead.
Someone give the Doctor a drink.
Mitchell, a glass of port for the Doctor.
Thank you.
There, just the girl I wanted.
You do have the damnedest luck.
Skill, old boy, sheer undiluted skill. The usual triumph of mind over matter.
It's a stinking awful night.
Hello, No.1.
Mitchell, a gin for the First Lieutenant.
Thanks, Torps.
The sea is getting up and I've got the middle watch.
Hey, stop.
You should put the ten on the nine.
I never noticed the damn thing!
Here's peace, peace, perfect peace, with loved ones far away.
Feeling all right, old man?
Sure you're not running a temperature?
No, of course not.
First time you haven't been late for a watch since we commissioned.
You're two minutes early.
I'm sorry, sir. It won't occur again, sir.
Bearing green 3-0, vessel on fire.
Yes?
Captain, vessel on fire, bearing green 3-0.
Press the alarm rattlers.
Come on.
I was dreaming I was in a Turkish harem and some fathead has to go and sound off action stations.
I wondered why you was pinching me.
Report to TS when closed up and cleared away.
Looks like a line of destroyers.
Number one gun cleared away.
Number two gun cleared away. Bore clear.
Number three gun cleared away.
All guns closed up and cleared away. Communications tested.
All quarters closed up to action stations. - Very good.
Open fire. - Open shutter.
Star shell commence. Open shutter.
Star shell commence, commence, commence.
Well done, guns. We've beaten them to it.
They've fired now.
Train right a little. Hold the leading destroyer.
Right, four stars. Go on!
They've gone over.
Go on. Stack'em up.
Don't go to sleep down there.
Come on.
Layer on!
Ready
We've hit.
Keep it up.
Stop star shell. - Stop star shell.
Star shell check, check, check.
We've hit again.
Torpedo tracks starboard, sir.
Stop, boys, midships.
Close all watertight doors.
Jettison top weight.
Keep those guns firing.
Flags, make to Tremoyne.
Take over.
Continue chase.
The power's off, sir.
Number one and number two mountings, carry on firing.
Number one and number two mountings, carry on firing
Number one and number two mountings, carry on firing
Number one mounting, carry on firing.
Let me know when you're ready.
Trainer on.
Look out.
Here she comes.
What's the damage, No.1?
Mess deck bulkheads are being shored up. It looks as if they're all right. But there's a good deal of damage aft.
We'll be a nice sitting target when it gets light.
Is Captain D alive?
Yes, old chap. You haven't succeeded to the command of this flotilla yet.
What did you do to Jerry?
Sunk one. The rest escaped in a smoke screen and one was badly damaged.
Not too bad. Tell Tancred to take me in tow.
Aye aye, sir.
How far are we from home, Pilot?
About 120 miles, sir.
Snotty, ask the First Lieutenant if he's all ready to tow for'ard.
We have all the guns working in hand, sir.
Good. We shall need'em, I expect.
Well, Blake. Don't move. How are you feeling?
Fine, sir, thank you.
Got concussed a bit, didn't you?
Yes, sir. I think I did, sir.
The First Lieutenant tells me that you stood by the gun even when most of the crew were knocked out.
Well, sir... somebody had to do it, sir.
You did damn well. I'm very proud of you.
Thank you, sir.
I want to see my captain.
It's all right, old man. I'm here.
Don't try to talk. Just rest.
Are the bulkheads holding all right?
Yes, sir, they're taking it very well.
How far have we made good the last two days?
We're about halfway there, sir.
The RAF ought to be here soon.
A nice nippy little fighter squadron, that's what we want.
I wish they'd get a move on.
Give'em time, old boy.
I'm sick of wallowing about here like a sitting duck.
Bravo!
Bravo! Hooray!
Make yourselves comfortable. We're all pretty tired.
There are one or two things I want to say.
First...
First, I'll hold a short memorial service next Sunday for our 36 shipmates who lost their lives, and return thanks that the old ship came through with so many of her complement.
I expect that Hitler is conferring the Iron Cross on the man who claims to have sunk us.
Secondly, I want to tell you that you all did pretty well in the trying time we've been through.
When a torpedo hits so small a ship as a destroyer, the result is bound to be fairly devastating, if not fatal.
And I can understand the tremendous temptation to think of your own skin first and the ship and your shipmates second.
I suppose, in a way, it's gratifying to feel that out of a ship's company of 244 men, 243 have behaved as I hoped and expected they would.
One man, however, did not.
That man has been charged with leaving his post without permission.
I needn't tell you how serious an offence of this nature is in time of war, nor how drastic is the punishment that normally follows.
You will be surprised, therefore, to learn that I have let him off with a caution.
Or perhaps I should say with two cautions - one to him, and one to me.
For in a way, I feel that what happened was my fault.
This man has only been in the Navy for six months. He has only been in this ship for two months.
Even so I feel that in that time I should have been able to make it clear to him that I did not expect and would not tolerate such behaviour.
I feel I should have been able to get at least that much of my creed across, but I failed.
I will not punish a man for an action for which I must hold myself largely to blame.
But I should like you all to know that after this, there will be no more cautions.
The next time we run into trouble - and as leader of a striking force, this ship's bound to be in more scraps -
I know that, come what may, no-one will fail to do his duty to the very end.
Thank you all for making my task so easy, and the Torrin a ship to be so very proud of.
Carry on, No.1.
Aye aye, sir.
Ship's company...'shun.
Turn for'ard Dismiss.
Look here, I've got to close up now. It's no use your staying on any longer.
You can't have any more to drink. It's after hours.
What's the matter with having some music?
If you've got a penny, you can have it. If not, you can't.
I have.
Well, put it in the slot, then. That's what it's there for.
I will.
Will you be requiring anything more before we close?
Look here, miss.
Judging by all I've had tonight, I ought to be drunk, see. I want to be drunk.
I want to be drunk more than I've ever wanted anything in my whole life.

Well... goodbye, Walter.
Goodbye, Freda. Don't go overexerting yourself, now.
Cheerio, Kath.
Be good.
Go on, Freda. Go on up to the gate with him.
You shouldn't have come. It's bad for you.
Don't be silly. It would be much worse sitting at home.
Besides, we've had an extra half-hour together.
It doesn't seem so bad this time, somehow. Perhaps I'm getting used to it.
Come on, give us a kiss and hop it. No sense hanging about.
All right.
Now, then. None of that.
Go on. Be a good boy. Don't get your feet wet.
I won't forget about having the mower mended.
That's right. And if things do get bad, you can always go to Dorothy's.
They'll have to be good and bad before I do that.
All right, obstinate.
Cheerio.
You know what you can do with all your Packards and all your Cadillacs. Give me a Rolls-Royce every time.
You're old-fashioned, that's what you are. Time marches on, you know.
What does the King have?
A Daimler.
I suppose you think that's old-fashioned.
Well, so it is, compared to a snappy 1940 Packard.
You couldn't have the King whizzing along the streets in a flash roadster.
Who said anything about roadsters?
I said before, and I'll say it again, there is nothing on land or sea to touch a good old conservative British make.
Give me a Daimler every time. You wanted a Rolls-Royce just now. You can't have both.
Looks like profiteering. - Look here, old man...
Oh, give it a rest.
I will.
How do you spell porpoise?
P-O-R-P-O-U-S, I suppose.
Why?
I've told my missus we've been escorting a convoy of 'em.
Anybody seen the Chief after the royal raspberry he got this morning?
Poor old Chiefy.
He hasn't been in to lunch yet.
Hello, Chief. We were just talking about you.
Damned nice of you.
Made any more filthy vapours?
Shut up, Guns. I've had enough of that.
I thought it looked very attractive, all that dense black smoke belching from the funnel.
I'll thank you all to lay off it.
Never mind, Chiefy.
Old Tremoyne went one better at about ten o'clock. - I thought she was on fire.
Bring me some food, Mitchell.
Have your sparkers picked up any titbits about the war?
Not since yesterday. Pretty bad show.
My young brother's in the BEF. He wasn't far from GHQ in Arras.
God knows where he is now.
The whole thing's been a lash-up.
You all know what we've got to do, don't you?
The whole British Expeditionary Force is falling back on Dunkirk.
Now, in peacetime, as you know, there's a lot of leg-pulling between the services.
But the soldiers are our brothers in arms and it's up to us to get'em off so they can live to fight again.
Let them see how much we admire the way they fought.
And don't forget, the success of our evacuation is measured by the smallness of the military casualties, not the naval ones.
The soldiers are our guests, and their lives will be in our hands.
Gangway, please
Gangway. Here we are.
Excuse me.
Mind your backs. Here you are, cock. Wet and warm.
Here you are, mate. Try dipping the biscuit in the cocoa. You can't hurt the cocoa and you can save your teeth.
The champagne will be along in a minute. That'll be hot, too.
Come on, Joey, up this way. Mind your backs, please.
A woman's work is never done. Here you are, mate. Coming up.
Here you are. Here, don't you want none?
Can't hold it, son. My hand's gone wonky.
Half a mo. Here, Joey, give us a couple of them biscuits.
Here, don't gulp it, now. You'll choke yourself.
Thanks, son.
Why did we never think of this for elevenses in the mess? It's damned good.
It's just Bovril rather heavily laced with sherry.
Port 20.
How's the old country looking now?
I feel as if I've been away for years.
We've been away quite a while, too. We put in up north every now and again to refuel.
The country's looking much the same as usual the last time I saw it.
Gentle, you know. Not exactly smug, but not exactly warlike, either.
There'll always be an England, eh? S u bboso t h at's as good a convv ct o n as a ny
A good deal better than most, sir.
What?
A good deal better than most...
Here you are, chum. Here's a nice cup of cocoa.
Want a biscuit?
Go on, leave it. He might fancy it later.
I never thought I'd be so glad to see a cup of cocoa.
That's right, chum, have another go.
Come on, it's better with your boots off.
What a swallow! Lovely. Have some more.
We're getting quite close. Good old white cliffs of Dover.
Look better with the sun on them. Still, can't have everything.
Damned lucky to see them at all.
Quite right.
Haven't had a chance to thank you, Kinross. The Navy's put up a fine show.
I hope you don't think we're not grateful. - Perhaps you'd care to dine one night.
Thanks. I'd love to.
We'd better get below, Jasper, and start lining up the troops. I expect you'll be wanting to push off as soon as possible.
You've struck rather a busy day.
Goodbye for the present.
Forgive me for not coming down.
Goodbye, sir. Thanks very much.
Goodbye. Good luck.
Just ordinary Bovril and sherry?
Just ordinary Bovril and sherry.
Good. Thanks.
Battalion... sling your arms.
Battalion... 'shun!
Turn to the left in threes.
Left... turn.
By the right, quick march.
Left, right, left, right.
If I wasn't so tired, I'd give them a cheer. And that's no error.
Ready to slip, No.1?
All ready, sir.
Let go aft.
Hold on to your spring, for'ard. Slow ahead, Starboard Pilot.
You'd never think there was a war on.
But there isn't. Not just for a minute, that is.
We've got five more whole days.
Flat calm. Looks like a piece of grey silk.
My auntie had a dress that colour, and she sent it to the cleaner's and it come back all spotty.
Funny to think this is such a little island, isn't it?
He's got France now, and France is only 20 miles from England.
Makes you think, don't it?
Mummy, Trafalgar won't eat sausage roll.
That's because you spoil him so dreadfully.
Look, Bobby. That one diving is a Hurricane.
No, it isn't, Dad.
It's an ME 109, like the one they brought down last Tuesday.
Don't speak with your mouth full.
What a perfectly lovely day it's been. Lovely for us, I mean.
I suppose that's very selfish of me, isn't it?
Extremely.
I can't believe it's so dreadfully wrong to forget the war now and again... when one can, just for a little.
I think it's very clever of you, with all hell breaking loose over our defenceless heads.
I made the most tremendous effort and pretended it wasn't real at all.
They were toys having a mock battle just to keep us amused.
That's the most shameful confession. Sheer escapism.
I don't care.
It has been a lovely day.
The sun's been shining and the country looks so green and sweet and peaceful.
And you are on leave, even if it's only till the day after tomorrow.
Teddy, I wonder where we shall all be this time next year.
A lot might happen between now and this time next year.
Take care of yourself, my darling.
It was a good honeymoon while it lasted.
Tweedledee smiled gently and began again.
The sun was shining on the sea, shining with all his might.
He did his very best to make the billows smooth and bright.
This cocoa gets thicker and thicker every night.
It's warming, anyhow, sir. Lines the stomach.
Well, it's practically porridge.
There goes another lot, sir.
Looks as if poor old Plymouth's going to get it again.
Well, I will say one thing for that bit of fish. There may not have been much of it, but it was tasty.
It's that Mr Morgan. He always favours us. It's Freda that gets round him.
The moment we got into the shop, up he comes with a chair as if we was royalty.
Oh, he's all right, if only he wasn't quite so nosy.
How are you feeling, dear?
Fine, thank you.
Did that letter from Shorty cheer you up?
I wish he was home, and I wish that ship would get a bit damaged, not so that anyone was hurt, mind you, but just so as he could get a little bit of leave.
Never mind, dear. Men must work and women must weep. That's what I always say.
That sink's stopped up again. It never rains but it pours.
We'd better get Mr Luton in.
He was blitzed out last week. Don't know where he's moved to.
Anybody seen my scissors?
Yes, I've got them.
Here they are.
Oh, here they are again!
Bit later than they were last night.
I wish you'd go down to the shelter, Freda.
Please don't start all that again, Auntie. You know I hate being shut up down there. It makes me feel sick.
I'd much rather stay up here, I would really.
But in your condition, I honestly think...
It's no use, Mother. Leave her alone.
It's all very fine you being calm and collected, but I'll tell you one thing here and now, my nerves won't stand much more of this.
You can go down to the shelter. Nobody's stopping you.
Try as I may, I can't understand why you won't shut up the house and evacuate.
I've told you why till I'm blue in the face.
When you could go away somewhere quiet, it seems just plain silly to sit here and ask for it.
Could go away! Where, I should like to know?
Well, there's Dorothy for a start. She's got a spare room.
Thank you for nothing. I've slept in it.
It may be a bit poky, but it's safe.
Once and for all, Mother, will you do me a favour and shut up about this?
I've told you how I feel and that's that. This is Walter's home, and he expects to find me in it when he comes back on leave.
What do you suppose he'd think if he turned up unexpected and found the house locked up and me hiding in the country?
He might only have a few hours. That'd be a nice thing.
You could let him know where we were, couldn't you?
Oh, it's "we" now, is it? I thought there was a catch in it.
Kathleen Hardy, how can you say such a thing to your own mother?
Well, I'm sorry, but you make me tired sometimes.
I'm sure I'm only trying to be sensible.
What about the garden and Walter's bulbs that he's so proud of? Who'd look after them?
Bulbs don't need any looking after. They just come up.
Come on, Freda. Under the stairs you go. Your chair's all ready for you.
Oh, I'm all right here, Kath.
Just do as you're told, there's a good girl.
We'll leave the door open like we did before so you won't feel lonely.
Oh, Kath! - Come on.
I'll bring your sewing.
The light's quite good in the hall.
That sounds like a land mine.
No, just an ordinary HE. Land mines make more of a rumble.
I don't like it, Kathleen. It's no use pretending I do.
I know you don't, Mother. Nobody does.
But there's no use in making a fuss, is there?
Cheer up, there's a dear. Are you all right, Freda?
Yes, thanks.
If you're cold, I can run up and get you an eiderdown
I'm quite warm.
We'll have some tea in a minute, anyway, just to keep us going.
Right you are. Back. Carefully, now.
Whoa. Back. Slow.
Tell Walter...
Tell him I didn't want to leave the house.
Nurse? Nurse!
Is it all over?
Yes, dear.
It's all over. Don't worry. Mother and child doing well.
This is the fourth time in three months we've put into this dead-and-alive hole.
Don't worry, cock. We'll be off again tonight.
I know. There's no need to rub it in. But I'm chock-a-block with this place.
Well, where could you go if you could get ashore? Look at it.
Nowt but sheep and seagulls. Not even a tree.
What do you expect in the north of Scotland? A blinkin' casino?
There must be one bottle of beer in Scotland. Just one wonderful bottle of beer.
Well, here comes Posty, anyway.
Edgecombe, Blake...
There you are, Shorty.
Hollett.
Stick it on the table, will you? My hands are wet. - I expect it's a bill from my tailor.
Mackeridge. - Only one? - That's right.
It's from my young sister. After months on the North ruddy Sea, all I get is a letter from my young sister.
Shut up grumbling for a bit, can't you?
Cheer up. It may be bad news.
Oh, dear, more trouble.
What's up?
Some fathead left the coal hole open. My old woman fell down it.
Joey!
Joey!
It's come. The baby's come. It weighs 7lb and it's a boy.
Here, listen to what she says. "It was born in the middle of a blitz..."
What's the matter?
Kath Hardy. Kath and her mother. - The whole house went and they got killed.
Mrs Hardy?
Yes. My missus was living with them, you know.
I wonder if anybody's told him.
They hadn't got any kids, had they?
No, they ain't got no kids.
Well... I suppose I'd better go and see if I can find him.
Hello, Shorty.
I er... just popped along to see if you had any news from home.
Not so much as a postcard, but that's Kath all over.
All the years we've been married, I've never known her get a post right yet.
Have you heard from Freda?
Yeah.
How's she doing?
She's all right.
Why, what's the matter?
It's Kath, Walter. She and Mrs Lemmon.
You see... They was all in the house together and...
it got blitzed.
What do you mean?
Kath got killed. Both of them did.
Freda was all right. She... She was under the stairs.
Oh, I see.
So, er...
I thought I'd better come along and tell you, seeing that...
Thanks, son. I'm much obliged. I'm much obliged.
I think I'll just go out on deck for a bit.
Righto.
I'm glad Freda's all right.
Yes, she's fine.
We er... We've got a son.
I'm glad. Congratulations.
She's going, sir.
Three cheers for the ship.
Hip, hip, hooray!
Hi hi hooray!
Look out.
They're coming again.
Dark object floating off starboard bow, sir. Looks like a raft.
You're right, Yeoman. Stand by to pick up survivors.
Aye aye, sir.
Keep up your spirits. I believe they've arrived at last.
Looks like one of the old flotilla.
Thank you.
I'm damned glad to see you, sir.
Thanks, No.1.
Captain sends his compliments, sir. Thank you.
Tell him from me, I warned him.
He won't get command of this flotilla yet.
It was an extraordinary bit of luck finding you. The Chief Yeoman spotted you.
We were about to give up.
How many of my men have you picked up?
90, sir. Some are badly knocked about.
Where are they?
Between decks.
Here we go again. Anybody got any Flit?
Anybody happen to know where we're going?
Alexandria, I expect.
Join the Navy and see the world. Looks to me as if it's going to be the next world.
It's all right. Don't move.
Glad you're OK, sir. - Thanks, Fisher.
We were getting a bit worried about you, sir.
Nothing like a good swim before breakfast.
Snotty, give me a piece of paper and a pencil.
It's... No.17.
Just as you turn out of... turn out of the high street.
All right. I've got the address straight. I'll let her know.
Thank you, sir.
All right, son.
Try it a little louder, son. I can't quite hear.
24... Gr... Greek Street.
All right. Don't worry. I'll write and tell them they can be proud of you.
Of all the persistent bastards! You'd think they'd get tired, wouldn't you?
I'll tell you something - strictly between you and I -
I'm scared stiff, and it's no good pretending I'm not.
If I could be at a gun, I shouldn't mind, but this sitting about and asking for it is beginning to get me down.
Brace up.
Remember Nelson.
Oh, all right!
Name of Blake?
Yes, name of Blake.
Here you are, then.
There's no answer.
Freda!
Dad!
Freda!
May! He's safe!
He's all right! He's safe!
He's safe, Freda!
He's safe! He's all right! He's safe!
What is it?
It's not... - It's from him.
He's sent a telegram. It's from him himself.
He's all right. My boy's all right.
But the ship went down. It said so in the papers.
Ook
OK... love.
There, there, dear. There isn't nothing to cry about no more.
Shall I wait for an answer? Oh...
Just a minute, I'll see.
Can we go down to the village after tea, Mummy?
I want to go on my bicycle.
I want to go on mine, too. - You can't.
You've got a flat tyre.
The girl's waiting for an answer, ma'am.
There's no answer.
Tell Mrs Bates and John it's from the Captain and everything's all right.
I'm so glad, ma'am.
Thank you, Emily.
Darlings, it's from Daddy. He was picked up and taken to Alexandria.
He's quite safe.
Oh, Mummy, Mummy, Mummy!
Ship's company...'shun!
Ship's company present, sir.
Thank you, Torps. Stand them easy, please.
Ship's company, stand at ease!
Stand easy.
Come a little closer.
I have come to say goodbye to the few of you who are left.
We've had so many talks, and this is our last.
I've always tried to crack a joke or two before, and you've all been friendly and laughed at them.
But today, I'm afraid I've run out of jokes, and I don't suppose any of us feels much like laughing.
The Torrin has been in one scrap after another, but even when we had men killed, the majority survived and brought the old ship back.
Now she lies in 1500 fathoms... and with her, more than half our shipmates.
If they had to die, what a grand way to go.
For now they lie all together with the ship we loved, and they're in very good company.
We've lost her, but they're still with her.
There may be less than half the Torrin left, but I feel that we'll all take up the battle with even stronger heart.
Each of us knows twice as much about fighting, and each of us has twice as good a reason to fight.
You will all be sent to replace men who have been killed in other ships.
And the next time you're in action, remember the Torrin.
I should like to add... that there isn't one of you that I wouldn't be proud and honoured to serve with again.
Goodbye. Good luck.
And thank you all from the bottom of my heart.
Goodbye, sir.

Goodbye, sir.
Goodbye, Hardy.
Here ends the story of a ship, but there will always be other ships, for we are an island race.
Through all our centuries, the sea has ruled our destiny.
There will always be other ships and men to sail in them
It is these men, in peace or war, to whom we owe so much.
Above all victories, beyond all loss, in spite of changing values in a changing world,
they give, to us, their countrymen, eternal and indomitable pride.
Open fire!
God bless our ships, and all who sail in them.
East Hill bus.
All right, lady, on or off, please.
Oh, yes.
That's all. Next bus!
Fares, please.
Beverly Crescent?
Who?
Beverly Crescent.
Get off next stop, take number 19.
Fares, please.
I'm sorry, conductor.
Would you mind stopping?
Leaving us already?
It's in the opposite direction.
That's about the only place we don't go, lady. Fares, please.
Why, Mrs. Miniver.
You know, I...
Don't tell me it's gone.
Just a minute.
Oh, I was so afraid you'd sold it.
No. We knew you'd come back.
I know it's foolish and extravagant but I've simply got to have it.
Yes, pack it up quickly, don't give me time to think.
Oh, careful, careful.
Why, vicar. This is nice.
For me. Let me put those on the rack.
Thank you.
Oh, no, not this one. I might leave it behind, and it's rather precious.
Yes, I know the feeling.
Guess what this is.
Port.
Worse than that.
Cigars.
Well, why not? My husband does.
He can afford it.
I'm not so sure.
He has a very extravagant wife.
Nonsense.
It's quite true. I can't help it. I'm afraid I do like nice things.
Things far beyond my means sometimes.
Oh, pretty clothes and good schools for the children, the car, the garden, you know.
Yes, I know.
Does it give you a lovely guilty feeling?
Lovely.
Oh, vicar!
Fellow sinners. What will the village say?
Oh, I think the village knows you're a very understanding person.
That's why you do so much good.
Well, I hope I do.
I hope I can when they need me.
You mean, you think there is trouble coming?
I think it's here.
Good evening, Lady Beldon.
Good evening, vicar.
Good evening.
Oh, shopping's impossible nowadays.
You can't get near the counter and when you do, they haven't got it and you pay twice as much for it.
What a wonderful description.
Sit down, Simpson. And don't sniff!
I spent the whole afternoon being pushed around by middle-class females buying things they can't afford.
Oh, dear, that means me.
Oh, no, much worse. You're Mrs. Mannering, aren't you?
Miniver. - Oh, yes.
The lawyer's wife.
No, my husband's an architect.
I knew he was something of that sort.
I don't know what the country's coming to.
Everyone trying to be better than their betters.
No wonder Germany's arming.
Good evening, your ladyship.
Good evening, Ballard.
Good evening, ma'am.
Good evening, Mr. Ballard.
Dear, this bag.
Vicar, do go on, please.
Well, goodbye, then.
Goodbye.
Thank you.
I was looking for you on the 5:00.
I missed it by two minutes.
Isn't that shameful?
Well, time and tide waits for no man.
And trains neither.
Are you too late, ma'am, to spare me a moment?
I got something to show you.
Well, I...
It's something very special.
Well, of course, Mr. Ballard. Do show me.
This way, ma'am.
Thank you.
Oh, Mr. Ballard.
It's my masterpiece.
How lovely.
You like it, ma'am?
I think it's the most beautiful rose I've ever seen.
The shape.
And the scent.
Divine. And the color...
I adore red roses.
'Tis said, as Cupid danced among the gods, he down the nectar flung which on the white rose being shed, made it forever after red.
Wherever did you find that?
Hutter's seed catalog, ma'am.
It's pretty, but it ain't true.
What goes to make a rose, ma'am, is breeding and budding and horse manure, if you'll pardon the expression.
And that's where you come in, ma'am.
I gotta have a name for it.
Oh, you want me to name it for you.
No, ma'am, I got a name for it if you'll give me your permission.
Why, of course. But I don't see...
I want to call it the "Mrs. Miniver".
If you'll pardon me, ma'am I've watched you go in and out of town for years now and you've always had time to stop and have a word with me and I've always waited for you to come home and you remind me of the flower.
And I figured it'd be a very good name for my rose.
It's a lovely compliment, Mr. Ballard.
I'd be very happy indeed to have you name your rose after me.
Well...
I really must go now. I'm terribly late already. Goodbye, Mr. Ballard and thank you.
Thank you very much.
No, no, no, thank you.
I think it's lovely having flowers named after you.
Goodbye.
Bye.
Thank you!
That's my wife.
Good as new?
Well, almost, sir.
It's a nice car, but afraid it's a little more than I can afford.
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.
We have some nice cars in a cheaper bracket.
But I like this one.
Well, I'm going to take it.
Perhaps you'd better think it over.
No, I'm going to take it.
Will you bring it tonight?
Very good, sir.
And don't let my wife know how much it cost.
Hello, Judy!
Daddy!
Good evening.
Mr. Miniver, you're just in time to hear Judy play her piece.
But I'm afraid...
It'd encourage her so much.
Encourage both of us, in fact.
I'm a little late. Next time.
See you later, Judy.
Bye, Daddy.
What's the hurry, Toby?
I can't stop, Daddy.
Napoleon wants to throw up.
Oh, does he?
I wouldn't dare tell you the price, though. I feel terribly guilty about it.
I was already on my way home and something seemed to come over me a sort of trance.
I got off the bus...
Hello, darling.
Oh, Clem.
How are you?
That's Clem, dear.
As I was saying, I got off the bus and I suddenly remembered that Vin was due down from Oxford tomorrow.
Yes, Vin, dear, tomorrow. Isn't that exciting?
And so we're all going down to the station to see him.
Isn't that wonderful?
Sophie, you idiot, Clem was standing right here beside me.
Of course I haven't told him.
You don't just throw things like that at a man.
Well, there wasn't any connection, I just had to say something.
Well, I'll probably tell him after dinner tonight.
He's usually most docile when having his coffee.
May we go to the station and meet Vin tomorrow?
Of course, darling, if you're good.
Is Vin still a vege...?
Vegetenarian", Mother?
I doubt it, darling. He'll have some new idea.
That was just a phase he was going through.
What's a phase?
Oh, it's just a thing people go through.
Do I go through it?
Yes, you're going through one now.
Am I?
I'm going through a phase!
I'm going through a phase!
Stop waving your arms and finish supper.
What phase will he be going through?
We'll have to wait and see.
Darling, I mustn't keep Daddy waiting.
Good night, sweetheart. Be a good girl.
Could I run down to the post, ma'am? Cook says she'll clear.
Well, of course, Gladys, but don't let Horace keep you out too late.
Rather a dashing fellow, young Horace Perkins, eh, Gladys?
Sir!
You know, Kay, I...
You know, Clem, I...
I'm sorry. Go ahead, dear.
No, what were you going to say?
Nothing important. I just wondered if you had a nice time in town, that was all.
Oh, wonderful. I shopped and shopped.
Just little things, you know.
Oh, I had a puncture in the car today.
Oh, no, what a shame.
Tires are getting pretty worn on that old bus.
Clem, you know what I think?
What?
I think you ought to buy yourself a new tire.
A new tire?
Yes, it might not be a bad idea, at that.
They aren't so frightfully expensive, are they?
Oh, I guess we can swing it all right.
A new tire shouldn't cost more than a new hat, should it?
A hat?
Well, I just said hat. I might have said shoes or trousers or anything.
Some more coffee, dear?
I have some, thank you, darling.
Yeah.
That old bus. Pretty sad.
Been giving a lot of trouble lately.
Has it?
I hadn't noticed it.
That's the danger with an old car.
You don't notice anything, then when you're doing 70 miles...
Not with our car, dear. - And that's another thing.
It's too slow.
That car is dangerously slow.
Clem, what have you been up to?
Come on. Get your coat and hat on. I've got something to show you.
Smooth, isn't she?
You all right, darling?
Yes.
I was afraid you'd think I'd been a bit too extravagant.
Oh, all of us are extravagant now and then, don't you think?
Of course. It's fun.
What's the use of having a little money if once in a while you can't be reckless with it on something you really want.
Where are you going?
After all, what is money?
It's the power to buy ourselves something that'll make us happier.
You shouldn't be a slave to it, though.
Say, what are you doing, anyway?
What on earth is that?
Do you like it?
Do you?
I bought it today.
Isn't it lovely?
Not bad.
I do think it does something for me, don't you?
Yes, it makes you look rather ridiculous.
Clem.
Maybe it's this gown. Doesn't quite go with it.
Yes, but just look at the hat itself. And if I've had my hair done it'd look different.
Yeah, it would be a difference.
Yes, it's very pretty.
Good! Then I think it was worth the money.
Much?
Not for people with a car like ours.
You're pretty clever, aren't you?
I hope you think so, darling.
Kay, sit down here a minute.
Let me look at you.
You're really quite beautiful, aren't you?
If you think so, darling.
I think you're even more beautiful than when I married you.
Could that be?
I don't see why not.
I've had more reason to be.
Put that silly thing away and get into bed, now.
Come on, don't stand looking at it all night.
In you go, there.
It's been a lovely day, hasn't it?
Yes.
Clem, I think we're very lucky people.
Because we've got a new car and a new hat?
Oh, much more than that.
Because of Vin and Toby and Judy and each other.
Yeah.
Clem.
Guess what.
I had a rose named after me today.
You left the light on in the dressing room tonight.
Good night, Clem.
Good night, dear.
There he is!
There he is!
Hello, Mother!
Hello, Vin!
Vin, darling!
Hello, Dad!
Fine to have you back.
Judy!
Hello, Toby!
Toby!
Vin! Vin's got a pipe!
What of it, young fellow?
Heavens, you've grown!
Only about half an inch, Mother.
I've grown a yard!
Have you, Toby?
Where's the mustache, son?
You used to be so proud of it.
I don't remember being so very proud.
I liked it.
Sorry. I found it took up too much of my time.
Oh, it did?
Keeping it trim and all that.
After all, one can't waste too much time over the vanities of life.
I see. Well, come along, children. We better get along.
Let's go. Here we go.
Oh, good heavens.
So your interest doesn't center on cars anymore, Vin?
Well, this last year at Oxford, I've rather changed my outlook on things.
You don't say.
Yes. I think I've grown a little.
Matured in my conception as to what life's about.
Do you know what Oxford taught me?
What, dear?
That I know nothing about anything.
Rather a waste of time and money.
Not at all, because it's shown me just what I want out of life.
And what's that, Vin?
To learn.
I want to encompass all the knowledge I can in my brief span.
What's "span", Vin?
It's a bridge.
A bridge?
I think of the amount of knowledge in the world:
Scientific knowledge, philosophical, sociological.
And when I realize the infinitesimal part of this I possess, it makes me shudder.
And apart from all that, Mother, I think I've developed a social consciousness.
What's that, Vin?
It's the recognition of my fellow man.
Where are there free men today any more than in the 9th to the 15th centuries?
Front door, Gladys.
Look, the 9th to 15th centuries, when the lords held all the land and parceled out what they wished to their vassals.
Look about. What have we?
As pure a feudalistic state as there ever was in the 9th through 15th centuries.
When I think about it, I'm appalled, genuinely appalled.
I tell you, Father... when I think of the class system that exists in this country to...
What is it, Gladys?
Oh, it's Miss Beldon to see you, ma'am.
Well, show her in, Gladys.
Miss Beldon. I wonder what that means.
Probably brought the latest ultimatum from her illustrious grandmother.
I scarcely know Lady Beldon.
The perfect example of what I've been saying.
Lady Beldon is the living proof of the survival of the feudal system today.
You can't escape the Beldon influence. It contaminates the entire village society.
Just as in the 9th to the 15th centuries.
Exactly.
How do you do, Mrs. Miniver? I'm Carol Beldon.
How do you do, Miss Beldon? This is my husband.
How do you do?
And my son Vincent.
How do you do?
Just in time for tea, Miss Beldon.
Thanks, but I've just had some.
Sit down anyway.
I can only stay a moment. Please, do sit down.
You really must excuse me for invading your house like this but frankly, I've come to make a request.
A personal request, and a great favor.
Well, please, sit down.
Thank you.
You see, my grandmother doesn't know I've come.
I'm afraid I'm not very good at breaking things gently so I'll get straight to the point.
The rose? - Yes.
The one Mr. Ballard grew.
The Mrs. Miniver.
I hear he's going to enter it in the flower show.
For the Beldon Challenge Cup?
Yes.
But no one ever has entered...
That is...
No no one has ever entered a rose in competition with my grandmother.
And that's just the point.
It's become a tradition for her to win the cup and her roses mean so much to her.
I know it seems an awful thing to ask but I thought you might, perhaps, as a favor persuade Mr. Ballard to withdraw his rose from the competition.
To be frank, it's such a beautiful rose it might easily win, and, well...
Miss Beldon may I ask whether this is an open competition?
Yes, technically...
Technically, yes, but actually, no.
Yes, I suppose that's it. You see...
I see only too well, Miss Beldon.
Because Mr. Ballard is not of the ruling class is a mere vassal, as it were...
Vin, please. Let Miss Beldon explain.
But, Mother, Miss Beldon doesn't have to explain, not to me.
I'm aware of the influence of the feudal system in this village.
These are orders from the manor. Her ladyship must have no competition.
You must excuse my son. He's just down from Oxford.
Don't apologize for me. I mean everything I say.
Well, I'm glad to hear it, but do you do anything about it?
Do?
Why, what do you mean?
If you feel something is wrong, what are you doing about it?
I've spent holidays the last few years doing settlement work in London slums.
You wallow in luxury all the year...
I don't wallow!
...and think a few weeks playing Lady Bountiful...
Come, Vin.
It's not much, perhaps but it's the only thing I know.
What have you been doing?
I?
Well...
I see. Just talk.
That's all right. It's easier.
Listen, I didn't say...
Oh, don't apologize.
I know how comfortable it is to curl up with a book full of big words and think you're going to solve the problems of the universe.
But you're not. A bit of action is required now and then.
Action?
If that's what you and your class are asking for maybe you'll get it one of these days.
Maybe.
But not from the talkers.
Vin!
Remember, Miss Beldon is a guest. If you have any manners at all...
Manners?
A humble working man is denied the reward of his artistry to gratify the vanity of an aristocrat...
Quiet.
This isn't your concern.
I beg to differ. I'm concerned for a fellow man's dignity.
And the indignity that's heaped upon him.
You'll excuse me, I'm sure, Miss Beldon.
Certainly.
I must apologize for Vin.
Oh, no, please, it's all right.
And besides, he's rather nice, isn't he?
What?
Well...
Really, you know, he's perfectly right.
I have not a leg to stand on in this business.
I shouldn't have asked you.
I realized that before the words were out of my mouth.
It's just that my grandmother's over 80 and takes such pride in winning year after year.
Of course.
But please forget I said anything about it.
Anyhow, I'm glad we met at last.
I hope we see more of each other.
I hope so too.
You'll be at the sailing club dance?
Oh, yes.
Good. I'll see you there, then.
Goodbye.
To hear people, you'd think Mr. Ballard committed a crime.
I don't hold with people getting ideas above their station.
Who's he to think he can enter his rose in the show?
And who's to say he can't?
Nobody's ever entered a rose against Lady Beldon since she started 30 years ago.
Keep a civil tongue or I'll be doing my shopping in Meekham after this!
My opinion has got nothing to do with the quality of my merchandise.
If you'd called your rose a "Lady Beldon", I'd have said right and proper.
But who's Mrs. Miniver?
The nicest lady in the neighborhood Mr. Huggins, that's who.
Yeah, maybe, but a newcomer.
No, Mr. Ballard, you stick to the railway and leave roses alone.
Why should I? Why should I?
They're my hobby, the roses are.
And the railway can go to...
Doesn't she look lovely?
And a sense of humor too.
I loved the way she handled Vin this afternoon.
I think she's coming over.
Hello.
Good evening, Miss Beldon.
Please, sit down. - Sit down, won't you?
Thank you.
Enjoying it?
Yes, such a wonderful band.
How about a cordial?
No, thanks.
Cigarette?
No, thanks.
I was rather looking for your son.
I'm sorry, Vin's not here.
No, he's suffering from an acute case of maturity.
Yes. But it'll pass. We give it a week or two, at the outside.
I wanted to tell him I was sorry about this afternoon.
I rather think he wanted to say the same thing himself. It's a pity...
I beg your pardon. For you, Miss Beldon.
Thank you.
May I? - Of course.
Secret?
Well, I suppose it is.
Do I scent romance?
Well, it is intriguing.
Will you excuse me? Please don't get up.
I'll see you later.
Is it that big Navy lad from Dartmouth?
You'd be surprised.
Hello.
Hello.
You got my note?
As you see.
Yes, of course.
Miss Beldon, I don't want you to think I'm going back on anything I said.
Of course not.
But I did express myself a bit emphatically.
I hope you'll excuse me. My mode of expression, I mean.
There's really nothing to excuse.
Everyone's entitled to his mode of expression.
Still, I had no right to lose my temper.
I'm usually quite detached.
I was pretty snippy myself, wasn't I?
And quite in the wrong, anyway. I'm sorry.
It's nice of you to say so.
Well...
I'd better be getting back. I promised this tango.
Oh, you couldn't. Well, I mean, just for a moment.
You see, I've got so much I want to say, to explain about myself.
Of course, you want to dance.
You don't dance?
Oh, yes. Yes, I do.
Matter of fact, I'm considered a pretty good dancer.
But I've rather given up that sort of thing.
Well...
I mean, frankly is this a time for frivolity?
Is this a time to lose one's sense of humor?
Did you say give him a week or two?
Maybe an hour or two will be enough.
And I used to see you go by and you used to ride in a little tub cart, then you had a pony.
Oh, yes. He was a dear.
He was very, very fat, and so were you.
I was not fat.
You were, very fat.
Why, you had legs like overstuffed sausages.
You see, I've really known you for years and years.
I used to think about you a lot.
Well, don't you believe me?
Well, you know, you are a good talker.
I'd like to tell you just how I feel.
You've told me a lot for one day.
One day. Why, one day's ridiculous.
What's one day out of all the vast...?
Do you have any conception...?
Can't we arrange to meet again sometime soon?
Tomorrow.
Tomorrow I'm leaving for Scotland.
For long?
Until the middle of September.
We always go, every year.
But that's months.
May I write to you?
Yes, Vin.
This has been a wonderful evening, hasn't it?
Yes, Vin.
It's been a wonderful evening, hasn't it?
Have I said that before?
It's been a wonderful evening.
For you too?
For me too, Vin.
Well, looks as though we've had all that quarreling for nothing.
Don't look as if there'll be a flower show after all.
What makes you say that?
Her ladyship's talking of postponing the show on account of conditions.
Very right and proper.
They've marched into Poland, haven't they?
That means war, if you ask me.
And if war comes it's "Goodbye, roses".
You might as well say, "Goodbye, England".
There will always be roses.
She's come back. She wasn't to have returned for another week.
Dearly beloved brethren, the scripture moveth us in sundry places to acknowledge and confess our manifold sins and wickedness.
And not dissemble nor cloak them before almighty God, our heavenly father.
But confess them with a humble, lowly...
Will everyone please be seated.
It has just been announced over the air by the prime minister that our country is at war.
In the circumstances I don't think you'll wish me to continue as you will probably, most of you, have some other duty to perform.
I will say simply this:
That the prayer for peace still lives in our hearts coupled now with the prayer for our beloved country.
We in this village have not failed in the past.
Our forefathers, for 1000 years, have fought for the freedom we now enjoy.
And that we must now defend again.
With God's help and their example we cannot and shall not fail.
Are we going to be bombed, Daddy?
Toby, don't shout, darling.
Are we going to be bombed?
Come on.
Carol.
I'll be right along, Granny.
Beg your pardon. Carol!
Hello.
You came back early.
Oh, I'm so glad. How are you fixed, in case of anything?
Quite all right, I think. I must go, Vin. Goodbye.
Yes?
Ma'am, I'm so glad you've come.
Gladys is carrying on...
Pardon me.
Carrying on something awful. I've had her on me hands all morning.
What's the matter?
It's on account of Horace.
Called up and asked to join his regiment tonight.
Yes, ma'am, and Gladys in floods of tears.
And that stove the man only come Friday to look at it, and what he done, I don't know.
But she's not fit to work. She's not, really.
Well, never mind, Ada.
I daresay we'll manage somehow.
Napoleon!
Toby, take him away.
I suppose they broadcast the news.
Yes, ma'am, what a dreadful thing.
And that laundry. Lost another of me best aprons.
But we've always got the navy.
That's right, Ada.
Oh, come on, now. Cheer up, Gladys.
Horace won't be anywhere near the frontline.
Oh, yes, he will. He's one to push himself forward.
He says, "You let me get me hands on Hitler. I'll give him sweatsticker".
Give him what?
Sweatsticker. You know, sir, the sign they have on their flags.
Well, that's the proper spirit, Gladys.
He's got too much spirit. He gives way to it.
I beg pardon, but would you tell Gladys Horace has got to catch his train and could he come in a minute and say goodbye?
Oh, of course he can.
Come in, Horace.
Thank you, sir. Morning, everybody.
Good morning, Horace.
Will you have a sherry?
Don't mind if I do.
And jolly good luck to you, Horace.
Yes, indeed.
Jolly good luck, Horace.
Thanks, Master Toby.
To your very good health. My best respects, ma'am.
The children are going to miss you terribly. And poor Gladys.
Oh, she'll be all right, won't you, Glad?
Here, here. That's not the way to behave.
How do you expect me to behave when you go off and get killed?
Well, cheer up. I ain't killed yet.
Here, have a drop of this.
You don't mind, sir?
Oh, certainly not.
There. That's better.
Have one for yourself now.
You'll want Gladys to see you to the station, won't you?
Go get your hat.
Very nice drop of stuff, this. Last I shall get for a bit, I expect.
Make a lot of difference to a lot of people, this war will.
Yes, a lot of difference.
We may all meet on the frontline yet.
Not me, Horace. The RAF for me.
Oh, boy!
I've always been keen on flying.
That's all right too.
Well, I got to get to me train. I'll say goodbye, ma'am.
Yes, of course, Horace. Goodbye, and the best of luck.
Goodbye, Horace.
Let us know how it's going.
I will. You'll excuse the spelling.
I'm better with a bayonet than with a pencil.
You can write it in blood.
Nice child you have.
Keep your chin up.
Thank you.
Hello!
Well, she's done you proud, Horace.
Not half, she ain't. Full dress inspection kit.
And very nice too, Gladys.
Thank you, ma'am.
Say goodbye to Napoleon.
Goodbye, all. And cat.
And many thanks, I'm sure.
Goodbye, Horace.
Bye, Horace.
Mind if I get on with the blackout?
All right, dear.
Thought I'd run up to the Beldon place later on.
Two women alone, you know, might be a good idea to look things over.
Yes, I think you should, dear.
One ought to be neighborly.
Oh, yes, indeed one should.
May I go with him, Mother?
If he'll have you.
No!
Isn't he very young, even for the air force?
Yes, he's young.
May I see Miss Carol?
Is she expecting you, sir?
No, but I think she would see me.
Vin!
Hello, Carol.
It's all right, Chandler. It's nice of you to come.
Well, I wanted to find out if everything's all right.
Do come in. Everything's fine.
After a terrific row with Mr. Foley my grandmother's agreed to obey the blackout regulations.
I was worried about you.
That's sweet of you, Vin.
It was sweet to write me letters while I was in Scotland.
So you did get them.
Yes, of course.
I wondered if you did when you didn't answer.
Vin, I didn't know how to answer.
You're such a crazy boy and I didn't think the craze would last.
Craze?
Well, it is rather sudden, isn't it?
This is only the third time we've met.
Does that matter?
No, but I'd like to be sure.
I don't really know you very well, do I?
We could do something about that. We could see a lot of each other.
Every day while I'm around.
Would that be all right?
Why, yes. Why not?
Gosh, I'm glad to see you again.
I'm glad too, Vin.
I say, is it an awful nerve?
Well, I mean, we have a sort of agreement, haven't we?
Would it be going too far?
It's all right, Vin.
I heard voices. May I ask whom you're entertaining?
This is Vincent Miniver. My grandmother.
How do you do, Lady Beldon?
Miniver?
Miniver.
I know that name.
A rose with that name has been entered in the show.
The Miniver rose.
That's something new.
The Marshall Neil, the flower called Drushke the Duchess of Argyle and now the Mrs. Miniver.
Please, Granny.
A tramp rose grown in a station yard.
It's nothing to do with Vin.
Then what's he doing here, if one may ask?
I came to offer my services.
I see.
You're in league with wretched Foley.
Oh, no, Lady Beldon.
Oh, Granny.
Never heard such rot.
We can take care of ourselves. We have for the last 800 years.
But...
We don't take orders, we give them.
Worst thing about this war is the chance it gives little persons to become important.
Air raids, indeed.
Those wretched Germans. They wouldn't dare...
What should we do?
Do? Nothing.
It's Foley giving a false alarm.
You can't take that attitude.
I beg your pardon, young man!
You must take precautions.
Ring for the butler and gather the servants in the cellar.
Then go down there yourself.
I must call my parents. The telephone?
In the hall.
Upon my word!
Sirens, milady.
I'm not deaf.
Get all the servants quickly to the cellar.
You too, Granny. He said so.
The cellar!
Hello? That you, Dad?
All right with you?
Yes, everything under control.
Right. I'll expect you when I see you, then.
Who is it?
Air raid warden.
Hello, Foley. What's up?
You're showing a light.
We are?
Bright horizontal beam plainly visible from the air.
Every window in the house is...
Ground level.
Oh, gosh. This way, Foley.
Thank you.
Good evening, Mrs. Miniver.
Good evening, Mr. Foley.
Yes.
How about this blanket, Mr. Foley?
I think I can use it, all right.
There. That fixes that.
It's those tiny cracks that do the damage.
One man lighting a cigarette stands out like a beacon from 5000 feet up.
One little crack of light might lead the whole German air force straight here.
Well, it was lucky it was just you.
Yes, indeed.
Strictly speaking, you're liable to a fine but as senior warden, you'll hear no more about it.
That's awfully nice.
You got a nice place here for storage.
Hear the Minister of Food the other day recommended stocking up a bit?
You want to put in some tin foods in case of emergency.
Sugar, now, sure to go out.
I've got some wonderful demerara. Will 50 pounds be enough?
Well, really, I...
Make it 20 pounds, best demerara.
Bismarck herring?
I hate them.
Kipper snacks?
Salmon?
Sardines?
I've got lovely Italian sardines.
Might not be able to get them later. You never know what Mussolini will do.
There you are. All clear.
They didn't get further than the coast.
Is the war over, Mommy?
No, darling.
This is just the first day.
Oh, good.
Oh, come on.
Attention, England.
This is your English friend in Germany again.
Now, listen carefully while there's yet time.
Time to avoid further useless bloodshed.
It's now eight months since your government declared war eight months of progressive disaster for the enemies of the German Reich.
France has been defeated as I told you she would be, if you remember and her invincible armies completely crushed.
I need hardly tell you that England comes next on the list.
Already the boasted British coolness has given place to blind panic.
Already there have been serious riots in your key industries and they didn't tell you that, did they?
Already the British lion is howling with terror.
Turn it off, George.
Had enough?
He's all wind and whitewash, like a blinking rook.
Can't we get some news?
Not till 9.
You work at the airfield. You see that German plane come down?
I heard it. I wonder where the pilot is.
With all that cover in them woods, he could lay there for days.
But he's got to get food, don't forget.
Be funny if he walked in here, wouldn't it?
He'd never do that.
I don't know so much.
They're clever. Some goes to Oxford and learns to speak English just as good as what you and me do.
Well, almost.
Did you get that Fritz?
Not yet. We will.
Whiskey. What are you having?
I'll have a beer, sir.
Pretty smart, these Jerries.
This chap was an ace too.
Got six of our fellows.
Cheerio!
Vin!
Hello, Dad.
Where did you spring from?
Belham Airfield.
You're practically on the doorstep.
Isn't it grand?
I was buzzing home when I saw you.
This is good news.
You don't know the half of it. See that? Pilot Officer Miniver.
So soon? I thought...
Things are moving pretty fast.
They cut short the course.
I got 85% on the test and a week's leave on the strength of it.
Great stuff. Congratulations. That calls for a drink.
What'll you have?
I don't think I will.
I phoned Mother I was coming. I called Carol too.
I'll bet you did.
I'll run up there later on.
How much do I owe you, George?
Five and sixpence.
There you are. Keep the change.
Thank you very much.
Bye, George.
Where is everybody?
Kay!
Well, what is this?
Vin!
Mother. Carol.
Oh, Vin. Vin, darling.
Carol, both of you, it's wonderful.
I didn't want to miss a minute. How are you?
Fine. Don't I look it?
He's brown.
Open-air life, Mother.
It's good to see you all again.
I sort of don't know which way to turn!
Seen these?
Makes a good-looking pilot, doesn't he?
Vin, already?
Two months before my regular time.
And what a bit of luck being transferred to an airfield so near.
A fellow I knew had his people living round about.
When he flew over, he'd cut his engine so they'd know who it was. Like this:
Well, I suppose now you're ready for real flying.
Not only for real flying but real...
Well, whatever they send me into.
Fighting.
Where are the kids?
Upstairs.
You wouldn't let them dine with us?
I might.
I'll run up and tell them.
No. I'm going.
Clem, coming?
Yeah. I've got to change.
Hello.
Hello.
Have you heard we're losing Gladys?
Is Horace on leave?
Oh, no, sir.
Gladys joined the WAAFs. She's off to Aldershot.
What's a WAAF?
Women's Auxiliary Air Force.
It's just a coincidence that Horace is stationed at Aldershot too.
Oh, sir!
You are a marvel.
Mother?
Yes, darling.
Is Vin going to marry Carol?
Now, Toby, just finish your dumpling, darling.
I only said, "Is Vin going to marry Carol?"
Isn't it nice having Vin at home and staying down here for dinner?
Yes. Are you going to marry Carol, Vin?
Well, since you bring it up, Toby, I haven't had the nerve to ask her.
Why not?
You're brave, aren't you?
Don't be so silly, Toby.
Gentlemen don't propose when they're eating.
Why not?
Well, it's not romantic.
Of course it isn't.
Toby.
What?
Why don't you ask me if I'm going to marry Vin?
Are you?
If he asks me.
He's afraid.
Why, say, I'm not going to stand for that.
Carol, I meant to wait for Judy's romantic moments and all that but will you marry me, Carol?
Oh, egads. This is the darnedest proposal I've...
Is it yes, Carol?
It's yes, Vin.
Oh, my dear, I'm so happy.
May I...?
Go ahead, Dad.
It's the telephone, ma'am. He wants to speak to Pilot Officer Vincent Miniver.
Hello. Yes. Yes, speaking.
Why, of course, sir.
Oh, I see.
About half an hour.
Yes, sir.
Immediately, sir.
Goodbye.
That was the airfield. I have to report.
It's a blow, isn't it?
Oh, but why?
Some job or other. You don't ask why in the air force.
I'm sorry, Mother.
I can't believe it, Vin.
They promised you a week.
You know how things are.
Good job I hadn't unpacked. I'll go get my bag.
I promised to be at the airport in half an hour.
I'll get the car and drive you over, Vin.
Well, it's a disappointment. No use pretending it isn't.
But now that we've got him so near...
Does that mean that he's going into action?
Not necessarily, Carol.
Well, I better get the car.
It certainly hasn't been much of a leave.
Goodbye, Mother.
Goodbye, darling.
Do take care of yourself.
Oh, I will.
Goodbye, you.
Be good. Remember, you're engaged.
Better not tell the old lady. Not until I get back.
Then we'll go hand in hand and beard the old lion in her own rose garden.
Goodbye, Judy.
Get me some souvenirs.
What do you want?
Messerschmitt.
Goodbye, Toby.
Bye, Vin.
Make me a dive bomber.
All right.
Bye.
So long.
Shoot down some Jerries and Fritzes.
I will.
Goodbye, and don't worry about me. 85% on the test, you know.
What a beautiful night.
Clear as day.
Happy about the engagement, Clem?
Oh, very.
Sweet child, young Carol.
Isn't she?
Wonder how the old lady's going to take it.
She'll be proud.
You couldn't be prejudiced, could you?
Certainly not.
Vin's a very unusual boy.
Yes.
Listen, Clem.
Engine trouble.
No, it's Vin.
Don't you remember what he told us about signaling?
About the boy who used to signal to his mother?
That was Vin.
By Job, I believe you're right.
Good old Vin.
Good luck, Vin.
Hello?
Clem!
Yes?
Who?
Oh, emergency.
I see. - What is it, Clem?
It's all right, dear.
Is it Vin?
Oh, no. It's only the river patrol.
All right, old man, I'll come right over.
You're not going out on the river?
I've got to. I'm on patrol.
I wonder what's up. 2:30.
What on earth can they want?
I can't imagine.
You've been out after that German flyer all day, and I'll not let you go.
Now I am confused.
Are those orders?
Where are you off to?
Sandwiches and a Thermos.
If you're going on duty, you'll need them.
Thank you.
Hello, Miniver.
Hello, Halliday.
Nobby, what's on?
I don't know.
He's your crew. How much petrol have you got?
About half full.
Why? What's up?
Fill her up, Dixon.
Hi, Mr. Miniver.
What's up?
Wish I knew.
What do you think?
Don't know.
Do you know?
All I know is I've been dragged out of bed to open up the bar.
Awfully glad you were.
A couple of points to starboard there.
Scots, wae hae wi' Wallace bled.
Hello, chaps.
Why the glad rags?
Well, I was in London at the Savoy and I got old Halliday's call and I come straight down.
Any idea what we're up to?
Who cares? "Theirs is not to reason why. Theirs is but to do or die".
Gallant 600.
Give me a drink.
Miniver, what you make of it?
I'll do anything for our country, but digging us out at 2 in the morning...
That carries the war too far.
Where are we going?
Orders are to collect all petrol boats of 30 feet and over I can lay my hands on shove crews in, fill them and send them to Ramsgate.
Ramsgate?
Why Ramsgate?
I don't know. Your guess is as good as mine.
The sooner we get off the better.
Hooray for Ramsgate!
Sign that for me, will you, Joe?
Sure thing.
Come on, Mac.
Sign that for me.
What on earth?
There must be close to 1000.
Look. Look, sir.
Attention, please.
Attention, everyone.
Attention, please.
Switch off your engines.
As you know, the British Expeditionary Force is trapped between the enemy and the sea.
Four hundred thousand men are crowded on the beaches under bombardment from artillery and planes.
Their only chance to escape annihilation rests with you.
Your destination is Dunkirk.
It's my duty to tell you that the effort is not without risk.
You are asked to cross 40 miles of open sea many of you in small boats that are far from seaworthy.
Shore guns and enemy aircraft are going to make it tough for you.
Any of you who wish to withdraw may do so now.
Very good.
We'll put to sea at once.
Smaller boats without compasses will follow in the wake of larger ships at the head of the line.
Every moment counts.
Good luck to you.
All right with you? - Aye, sir.
Turn her over.
Good morning, ma'am.
Good morning, Mr. Ballard.
You're up early.
Yes. I haven't been sleeping very well.
Listen.
Guns.
Funny how the sound carries with this east wind.
Mr. Miniver's not back from Dunkirk, I suppose?
No, he's not back. Neither is my son.
They've been gone five days now.
Oh, they'll be back, ma'am. You'll see.
Yes.
I'll be very glad to see.
You will.
Them that goes down to the sea in ships and has business in the great waters these men see the works of the Lord and his wonders in the great deep.
You can't beat the Bible, can you, when it comes to deep feelings?
And no one that's thrown that over for a set of Goebbels and Görings is going to win this war.
That's my comfort, ma'am.
Mine too, Mr. Ballard.
There's to be a flower show this year, you know, up at Beldon Hall.
It takes more than a war to stop her old ladyship.
Oh, I am so sorry. What were you saying?
I was telling you about my rose, ma'am. I've entered it for the show and I...
Well, I should know better than to be bothering you.
Oh, but you're not. I'm so glad.
It's a beautiful rose. It deserves a prize.
Thank you, ma'am. Well...
I'll be getting along.
Good day, Mr. Ballard.
Move or make noise, I shoot.
Alone?
My children are upstairs, and the maid.
All asleep.
Food. Drink.
All right.
Food, quick.
I'm getting it.
Stop pointing that gun at me! You're frightening me!
Milk. Milk.
Hurry.
Give me.
You got meat?
Yes, I think so.
Hurry.
I am hurrying.
Go back.
It's the milkman.
Coat. Give me coat.
Wait.
I'll get you the coat.
Keep door open.
Go.
The police. Urgent, please.
Police?
This is Mrs. Miniver.
Miniver.
Starlings. I've got that German flyer, the one who escaped.
In the kitchen.
Yes, I'm all right. Will you come to the back door?
He's wounded. Bring a doctor.
Thank you.
I took your gun.
You call police?
Yes. It's much better.
Let me help you.
There, now. It's much better this way. Really, it is.
You'll be wonderfully looked after in a hospital.
You'll be safe there.
The war won't last forever.
No.
Soon we finish it.
I'm finish but others come like me.
Thousands, many thousands.
Better.
All of this you will see.
You will see.
We will bomb your cities like Barcelona Warsaw Narvik, Rotterdam. We will come.
Rotterdam we destroy in two hours.
And thousands killed. Innocent people.
Not innocent!
They were against us!
Women and children!
Thirty thousand in two hours.
And we will do the same thing here!
It's his arm, doctor.
All right, sir.
Come along, young fellow.
Thank you, ma'am. Move along now.
You all right, Mrs. Miniver?
Yes, thank you, doctor.
Mommy?
Who was that, Mommy?
Who was here, Mommy?
Who was here?
Clem!
It's Daddy, darling!
It's Daddy!
Run and tell Judy.
Judy!
Judy!
Clem, darling!
Darling, are you all right?
Hello, darling.
Oh, I'm so glad to see you.
Daddy!
Daddy!
Hello, darling.
Daddy!
Daddy!
How are you?
You're awful dirty.
And I'm awful tired. Gosh, I'm tired.
Come. You're going straight to bed.
Are you sure you're all right?
Yes, I'm fine. Just the boat.
Come on, children.
Go on, Toby.
Any word of Vin?
No, but he'll be back soon. I'm sure of it.
Darling, it's so lovely to have you home. Come on, Toby.
I want to sleep for a week.
There, darling.
Oh, that's good.
Can I get you some breakfast, darling?
It's Vin, Clem!
It's Vin!
He's back.
Did I hear you offer me some breakfast?
Ten hours ago.
Ten hours?
But Vin ate it.
Vin, home?
Home.
Both of you.
Where is he now?
He went up to Beldon Hall to break the news of the engagement.
I don't envy him that trip.
Serves him right, though, for eating my breakfast. Anything left?
What do you want?
Well, I should...
What have you got?
I'll find out.
Ada!
I didn't know when you'd wake up, so I couldn't order anything for dinner.
Breakfast. No matter what time it is when I wake up, it's breakfast.
Come in.
Hello, Ada.
Well, I am glad to see you, sir!
After what it said in the papers, I was quite worried about you.
I was.
That's nice of you, but I'm all right.
All I need now is a good large plate of ham and eggs.
All right, sir.
Then it is in the papers?
About Dunkirk?
Yes.
Yes, dear.
Thank heavens. I shan't have to tell you about it.
Clem, I'm so proud of you.
Are you, darling?
Well, that's nice.
And come to think of it, I'm a bit proud of myself.
What you might call a real bit of navigation.
I wouldn't have missed it for the world.
Oh, darling, I'm almost sorry for you, having a nice, quiet, peaceful time when things were happening.
But that's what men are for, isn't it?
To do things while women look after the house.
Yes, dear. Come in.
I'm sorry, ma'am, but I just remembered we ain't got any ham.
What?
You gave it all to that German pilot.
Oh, well, never mind.
We've got some bacon. Mr. Miniver likes that just as well.
All right, ma'am.
What's that about a German pilot?
Nothing at all.
What do you mean, "nothing at all"?
Well, I just had a German pilot in for ham and eggs this morning.
Wait!
What's going on here?
Now, Clem, don't get excited.
I'm going to draw your bath.
I've had a bath. I'm not excited!
A cigarette?
No, I don't want one.
Was it the fellow we were looking for?
Yes.
But what did you do?
Woman, you're driving me crazy. Didn't he have a gun?
Well, yeah, he had a gun.
Well?
I took it from him and called the police.
Oh, you just took it to the police...
Just like that.
And then I suppose you gave him tea.
Milk.
Milk.
Clem!
Come in.
What is it, Ada?
It's the old lady, ma'am. And me with the eggs on the stove.
It's Lady Beldon.
Beldon, here?
No, ma'am. Downstairs.
All right. Tell her I'll be down in a minute.
Very well, ma'am.
Lady Beldon.
If I hadn't known you'd taken that pilot single-handed, I'd say you were scared.
I am scared, just as I was when I took that German pilot single-handed.
Know why she's come in such haste?
To object to the marriage, I suppose.
It's really insufferable snobbery.
A boy like Vin, she ought to be proud and happy.
And honored.
I wish I had a better dress on.
Oh, well.
Clement Miniver, don't you dare smile.
Why, Lady Beldon, this is nice.
Won't you sit down here?
I think I can guess why you came.
Vin's told you his news, hasn't he?
Yes, Mrs. Miniver.
I do hope you're as pleased as we are.
I'm afraid not.
Why, they're infants.
Carol's 18 and that boy's not 20.
Yes, they are young.
I think I should tell you frankly: I hope to persuade Carol to wait.
You think she may change her mind?
Frankly, yes.
Perhaps make a better match.
There's always that possibility.
Of course, it may be just maternal vanity but I don't think Carol will find anyone nicer than Vin.
I don't believe she'll change her mind.
It's a matter of opinion.
Her age is a matter of fact.
Isn't that Beldon tradition to marry young?
I don't know what you mean.
My daughter Judy...
You've not met Judy.
She had to write a composition on the Crusades.
She brought a small book home from the library called A Friend of King Richard the Lion
It was a life of an ancestor of yours.
Really, I fail to see...
It was a fascinating book. I got quite interested in it myself.
It was full of stories of the Beldon family.
I trust you satisfied yourself we were worthy of the alliance.
Well, there were one or two things that rather surprised me.
Did you know that the 12th Lord Beldon was hanged?
He was beheaded.
Such things happen in the best families.
Usually in the best families.
In fact, what interested me most was the extreme youth of the Beldon brides.
This Gilbert Beldon who went on the Crusades, married an Isabelle Du Something-or-other, age 12.
I did not come here to chatter pedigrees.
I'm old-fashioned. I believe in breeding.
That's neither here nor there.
Your point is, they're too young.
I've said so, haven't I?
We're at war, Lady Beldon. And Vin's a flyer.
It's no excuse for rushing into an ill-considered marriage.
But in war, time is so precious to the young people.
How old were you when you married?
It's no use telling fibs because I looked you up.
Oh, well, if you've looked me up I suppose you know that I was 16.
Sixteen. And did your parents approve?
That's beside the point.
Oh, forgive me. Is it?
You married very young, without your parents' consent and yet when Carol...
Oh, but perhaps you regretted it.
I did nothing of the kind.
Then why...?
My marriage lasted a few weeks.
My husband was in the army. He was killed in action.
Oh, I'm so sorry. Forgive me. I didn't know.
I never regretted it. Not for one moment.
We married because we knew that might happen.
But I don't want Carol to suffer as I suffered.
Don't you want her to be happy, even for a little while the way you were?
I was afraid you'd say that.
Not that it matters what you say. Or what I say, either.
You know that, don't you?
You mean, Carol will go her own way?
She's my granddaughter.
Well, then why?
Goodness knows.
I was beaten before I started.
You don't mind terribly, do you?
He is a nice boy.
Yes.
I see now where he gets it.
You're pretty too.
No wonder that wretched Ballard named his rose after you.
Not that he's got a chance of getting the cup from me.
Well, so long as we're going to be relatives the least you can do is to offer me some tea.
Well? - Oh, yes.
Yes, of course.
So Alice sat on with closed eyes and half believed herself again in Wonderland.
With the grass rustling in the wind and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds the tinkling sheep bells, the voice of the shepherd boy and the lowing of the cattle in the distance.
She pictured to herself how she would keep through all her riper years the simple and loving heart of her childhood and how she would gather about her other little children and make their eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale.
Perhaps even with a dream of Wonderland".
They're asleep.
Good.
What time is it, darling?
Going to have your coffee now?
No. I think I'll have a little smoke first.
Anything you want from the house?
No, I don't think so.
I'm not going to risk my life for your knitting needles again.
No. I've got them with me.
Fine barrage tonight, isn't it?
It gets better each time.
I can't hear any bombs, can you?
No.
I suppose they're saving them for the aerodrome again.
Yes.
And the county hospital.
Well.
My laundry come back?
Tomorrow.
Tomorrow.
Oh, no, you don't.
You ought to patent that, Clem.
It saves us from suffocating.
See this new idea?
No. What is it?
The latest in gas detectors. If there's any gas, the gauze turns green.
Does it stop the gas from coming in?
If you see this gauze change color grab this, shut it with a bang like that, see?
Then what happens?
Then we suffocate.
Biscuit?
Thank you.
Mrs. Miniver's best.
Ada wasn't much good at coffee.
She was awful.
Still, she was a good cook, as good cooks go.
And as good cooks go, she went.
Still, Ada will be a tower of strength in the tank corps canteen.
Closer.
I wonder what Toby would do if he lost that cat.
I daren't think.
I suppose that's the way to be really happy.
Be with something that you just can't live without.
Or someone.
Isn't that getting a little long?
Vin says they like them long in the air force.
Isn't it nice they're getting back for the flower show?
Yes, isn't it?
Find out when their train arrives?
11:45, I think they said.
Good.
I am glad they went to Scotland for the honeymoon. It's so beautiful.
Yeah.
That's a bomb.
They are going for the aerodrome again.
Have you finished with this, darling?
Yes.
It's a lovely story.
I wonder if Lewis Carroll ever dreamed it would live forever.
You know, it's the first story I read.
Mine too.
Really?
How she would keep through all her riper years the simple and loving heart of her childhood and how she would gather about her little children and make their eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale".
Perhaps even with the dream of Wonderland of long ago.
And how she would feel with all her simple sorrows and find a pleasure in all her simple joys remembering her own child life and the happy summer days".
The happy summer days.
Napoleon's all right, darling. He's gone under there.
Mommy?
Yes, dear?
They nearly killed us this time, didn't they?
It's all over, darling. It's all over now.
Hello, Mother. Hello, Dad.
Hello, darling.
How have you been?
We had a wonderful time.
Good-looking bride you've got, boy.
Hello, Mother!
Oh, my God.
Good to see you again.
Wonderful.
Carol, sweet.
Don't I get a kiss?
Certainly do.
Did you enjoy yourselves?
We had a lovely time.
We fished and rowed and sailed.
We had a lovely little cottage and a Mrs. McLorry to cook for us.
How she cooked, and how we ate.
Can I help you, Dad?
No.
Hello, Mr. Ballard.
How do you do?
Morning, Ballard. I see you've entered your rose in the flower show.
It's a good rose.
I haven't seen it yet.
I wager the best thing about it is its name.
The Mrs. Miniver. That's you, my dear.
You're coming to the flower show?
All except Clem.
I'm afraid I can't. I'm on patrol duty.
You're missing a lot. Local talent.
Old Snope is playing his flute solo.
I'll be there early. - All right.
Goodbye, dear.
Careful.
How's it going, George?
Fine, Mr. Miniver. Just fine.
Let's go, Vin.
Well, here we are.
Welcome home, such as it is.
It's quite a mess.
It must've been dreadful.
Oh, it's not as bad as it looks. We just didn't have time to clear it all up.
The dining room there got the worst of it.
But I always did want to do that room over.
The upstairs is quite all right.
Yeah.
Darling, we'll have to get some blankets up there and black that place out.
Toby, old boy.
Vin!
Vin.
Hello, Toby.
Carol.
That was wonderful.
Did you have a nice trip?
It was fine.
I've had the mumps.
Oh, this was a lovely surprise.
All right, children, let Carol go now. Come on, Vin.
I'll take you up to your room.
It's your old room, of course, Vin, but we made a few changes.
Yeah, the Jerries made a few more.
Thank your father too, darling.
I'll do that right away and bring up the rest of the luggage.
Thanks for the lovely room.
And thanks for Vin.
He is nice, isn't he?
I wonder if you know how much I love him.
I only have to look at you. And him.
Have you seen the view here?
It's really beautiful.
Oh, it is.
You're happy?
Of course.
I've had a lifetime of happiness in these last two weeks.
But, Carol, that's only the beginning.
Kay, I'm not afraid to face the truth.
Are you?
No.
I love him, but I know...
Carol.
I know that I may lose him.
He's young and he loves life, but he may die.
Let me say it.
He may be killed any day, any hour.
You must have faced that in your mind.
Yes, I've faced it.
Then you know that every moment is precious.
We mustn't waste time in fear.
You won't hate me for saying this, will you?
No, Carol.
I will be very happy.
Every moment that I have him. Every moment.
If I must lose him, there'll be time enough for tears.
There'll be a lifetime for tears.
That's right, isn't it?
Well, that's the lot. All my wife's.
Say, have you noticed her crested dressing case? Swank, eh?
Have we time to unpack?
Yes. We won't lunch till 1.
I promised we'd be at the flower show by 3. Can't miss the entertainment.
The glee club has a new number.
There will now be an interlude by the Belham band.
Hello, Ballard. How are you?
All right, thanks.
Good luck. The best of luck to you.
Thank you.
I hope you get it, Ballard.
Thanks.
Bickles.
Yes, milady.
Hurry that paper from the judges. We want to get through with it.
The judges are still debating, milady.
What?
Whatever for?
Ridiculous creatures.
Go and tell them I want that decision at once.
Yes, milady.
Have you seen old Ballard's rose?
No, I haven't.
That's a lie.
I looked it over the moment it arrived.
Well?
It's a good rose.
Is it better than yours?
That, young man, the judges will decide.
You should worry. You'll get the cup.
You insinuating the judges are corrupt?
They're scared of you.
Oh, rubbish. Scared.
The decision on the rose award, milady.
Well, Mr. Vincent Miniver, take a look at that.
Congratulations. I'm not a bit surprised.
Set yourself up to know more than the judges, eh?
Misguided young man.
Can't think what you see in him, Carol.
This is really important to you, isn't it?
It's stupid of me, but there it is. I've won that cup for as long as I can remember.
Mr. Ballard's terribly keen too.
Well, he's had his chance. Hasn't he?
You have such a way of looking at people.
What do you expect me to do?
Reverse the judges' decision?
I wouldn't put it past you.
If you happened to disagree with it.
But I don't!
Will your ladyship make the awards now?
Certainly.
This rose award, it's your unprejudiced decision?
Why, certainly, milady.
Of course, milady.
Won't you sit down?
Sit down.
My friends of Belham, it is once again my pleasure to present the annual awards for the best flowers grown in our community.
The first-prize chrysanthemums.
First prize, Miss Alice Lovedean.
Second prize, Miss Sarah Pillbury.
Congratulations.
Thank you, milady.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, I come to the final award.
The Challenge Cup, given for the best rose...
The best rose grown in the village during the past year.
The first prize, the Silver Cup, goes to...
Goes to Mr. James Ballard, our popular stationmaster.
The second prize, the Certificate of Merit goes to me.
All right. All right.
All right. All right.
This is the first time a rose other than the Beldon rose has won the cup since the show's began.
I won't say I'm not disappointed.
We Beldons are not used to competitors.
In the old days, we just lopped off their heads.
Can't do that nowadays, more's the pity.
But if I had to lose there's no man I'd sooner lose to than James Ballard because he's a man of spirit, and I like a man of spirit.
Where are you?
Ballard!
Where's that man?
Here he is, milady!
Here he is!
Oh, Mr. Ballard, I'm so happy for you.
It's your rose, ma'am.
Excuse me, milady.
Not now, Foley.
Well, take it.
Thank you, milady.
Congratulations.
Pardon the liberty.
Milady, enemy planes over the coast, hundreds of them.
Like as not, they'll go after the airfield again.
Order. Order.
Silence!
I'm sorry to disturb the harmony of this occasion but our enemies are no respecters of flower shows.
Foley here says there's a chance of air raiders passing this way.
In the circumstances, it might be better if you would return to your homes.
Those who prefer are welcome to the use of my cellars.
It'll be lively. My young visitors will see to that.
And you won't starve. Foley's seen to that.
I believe we have 300 tins of Italian sardines.
Granny, you'll be all right?
Of course.
You're not leaving me alone.
You were wonderful. They loved you.
Vin needs to get back to the airfield.
Yes, of course.
Give them a blast for me, will you?
I shall certainly try.
Wait. I still like to be kissed, you know.
Of course.
I say, you were wonderful.
Yes, I was wonderful.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Goodbye, Carol.
Jerries over London in hundreds.
I'll have to run. Goodbye, darling.
Goodbye, Mother.
Vin.
He'll be all right, Carol.
We must get on, Carol. I'm anxious to get back to the children.
Do you think the Foley girl will take the children into the shelter?
Of course. Don't worry, Kay.
They seem to be fighting right over our heads.
I want so much to get home.
I hate to stop, but I suppose I'd better.
It could be Vin. It could!
No, Carol, no. It's not possible.
There hasn't been time.
Oh, no.
How horrible.
Those were bullets.
And I was sure they hit the car. I really was frightened.
Of all the...
Oh, Carol.
The village.
Oh, how awful.
Oh, we must get back there. They need help.
Carol. Carol, what is it?
Carol.
Carol, are you hurt?
Oh, darling.
Carol.
God, I think I've been hit.
Oh, no, darling.
Where?
I don't know. It doesn't hurt.
I just can't move.
Don't be frightened, we're nearly home. I'll get you in and get help. Now, lie still.
Yes, Kay.
Emergency.
Emergency?
Ambulance, at once.
All out?
But this is terribly urgent.
So is this, an air raid casualty that's terribly...
Well, the moment you get one in, the first possible moment send it to Starlings.
No, Starlings.
Yes, the last house in Norton Lane.
Yes, and hurry, please. Hurry.
They're coming as soon as they can.
I'll get a coat, darling.
They'll be here any moment now.
You won't tell Vin?
Of course not, darling.
Darling.
You're going to be all right, Carol. I know you are.
Don't be frightened, sweet.
I'm going to be all right.
I don't feel any pain.
What is it?
Can I get you something?
Glass of water.
Of course, darling.
I'll be right back.
Carol.
Carol.
Oh, God.
God.
God.
Vin, dear.
It's all right, Mother. I know.
Where is she?
Vin, dear, won't you try and get a little rest?
Where is she?
In your room.
I will read to you from Psalm 91.
I will say of the Lord, He is my refuge and my fortress.
My God, in him will I trust.
Surely, he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler and from the noisome pestilence.
Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night.
Nor for the arrow that flieth by day.
Nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness.
Nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday.
He shall cover thee with his feathers and under his wings shalt thou trust.
His truth shall be thy shield and buckler".
We in this quiet corner of England have suffered the loss of friends very dear to us.
Some close to this church.
George West, choirboy.
James Ballard, stationmaster and bell - ringer and the proud winner, only an hour before his death of the Beldon Cup for his beautiful Miniver rose.
And our hearts go out in sympathy for the two families who share the cruel loss of a young girl who was married at this altar only two weeks ago.
The homes of many of us have been destroyed and the lives of young and old have been taken.
There's scarcely a household that hasn't been struck to the heart.
And why?
Surely you must have asked yourselves this question.
Why, in all conscience should these be the ones to suffer?
Children, old people a young girl at the height of her loveliness.
Why these?
Are these our soldiers?
Are these our fighters?
Why should they be sacrificed?
I shall tell you why.
Because this is not only a war of soldiers in uniform it is a war of the people.
Of all the people.
And it must be fought not only on the battlefield but in the cities and in the villages.
In the factories and on the farms.
In the home and in the heart of every man, woman and child who loves freedom.
Well, we have buried our dead but we shall not forget them.
Instead, they will inspire us with an unbreakable determination to free ourselves and those who come after us from the tyranny and terror that threaten to strike us down.
This is the people's war.
It is our war.
We are the fighters.
Fight it, then.
Fight it with all that is in us.
And may God defend the right.
Here come the wolves.
Mr. Roosevelt should hear of this.
I'm sorry. Hope you didn't hurt yourself.
My friend says he's sorry.
Okay.
That just goes to show you what a little blonde can do to hold up national defense.
Nice, pleasant guy.
Gee, 100 bucks.
So that's what they look like.
Where'd he go?
I don't know.
I wonder what his name is. Wait a minute.
I saw it on the envelope.
That's it. Fry.
Fry.
How do you know my name?
What do you care how I know your name?
I saw it on one of the envelopes you dropped.
Here's something that belongs to you.
The paint shop! Lt'll go up like dynamite!
Here, take this one.
What about me? Don't I get to play, too? You get another one.
All right.
So, I see these two kids, see. And I yell at them, "The sprinklers are busted,
the whole shooting match will go up."
And they run right in, the both of them.
And the last thing I saw when I looked back was one kid give the extinguisher to the other kid, and then it was just like all hell comes up.
That's all I see.
Was there anybody else around?
Just the two kids.
The poor kid with the extinguisher, and the one who gave it to him.
Thank you, Rogers. We appreciate all you've done.
We needn't keep you any longer now.
You'd better go and take care of those hands.
Who've you got next?
We have a fellow, Barry Kane, waiting.
Send Barry Kane in!
Barry Kane!
All right. Just take it easy.
We only want to ask you a couple of questions, a matter of a routine check-up.
Well, I want to do anything I can to help.
Sure.
Now, suppose you tell us where you were when the fire started.
Well, I was one of the first to rush in.
The sprinkler systems weren't working.
Who else was with you?
There were just myself, a fellow named Fry, and my friend Ken Mason.
Go on.
Fry handed me an extinguisher, and I started running toward the fire.
I gave it to Ken.
And then he...
Okay. Take it easy.
That's all.
Just stick around for a while. We may need you.
Send for Fry.
Get hold of a fellow called Fry.
What'd they do?
Ask you a lot of questions? No.
Hardly any.
Gee, it's awful tough going, seeing it happen in front of you.
Yeah, it is tough.
Ken Mason was your pal, too, wasn't he?
Yeah.
Was he married? No.
He was living with his mother.
Must be pretty tough on her.
Sorry, fellows. I'll see you later.
Hello, Mrs. Mason.
They...
They wouldn't let me see him.
It's awful hard to believe. It happened so quick.
Why, only this morning...
Please...
Please don't talk about it now.
Anything I can do? Could I get you something?
No.
No, thank you. Not now.
Maybe some brandy.
How is the poor, dear soul?
If you mean Mrs. Mason, she's feeling bad.
Oh, well, she has every reason to.
Do you know what? They wouldn't even let her see him.
Her only son. Yes, I know.
I told her she'd every right to insist on seeing him.
I told her I would, and she as good as told me to get out.
Me that was only trying to help the poor, dear soul.
I think you can help, if you'd tell me where I could get some brandy. It doesn't seem to be in here.
You come with me, young man. It just happens that I have a little in the house.
Sorry to bother you, Mrs. Mason, but we're looking for a guy named Barry Kane.
He isn't here right now, is he?
They told us at the plant we might be able to find him here.
Well, what do you want to see him about?
He's in pretty bad trouble, lady.
What is it? I'd like to know.
He was mixed up with that fire at the factory.
I don't understand.
There are a lot of things we don't understand, either.
But how is Barry involved in it?
That fire extinguisher.
It seems it wasn't just an accident.
It turns out that the extinguisher Barry Kane handed your son was filled with gasoline.
You ought to be able to help us. Give us a lead on this guy Kane. Yeah.
That's why we want to look around.
I can't talk about it now.
Sorry, but, you see, there was a...
I wouldn't give her too much of that if I were you, because it very often makes people weepy.
I know it affected me like that... Yes, Mrs. Moore, I've got to hurry back.
Thank you very much.
Try some of this, Mrs. Mason. It'll make you feel better.
There were two detectives just here.
They were looking for you.
For me?
I guess they want to ask me some more questions. I said that I'd do anything I could to help. Here.
Try, please. No.
That wasn't it.
They wanted to arrest you.
They said that the fire extinguisher that you handed to Kenneth was filled with gasoline, that you killed him.
That I killed...
Why, are they crazy?
Why would I want to do a thing...
Why, Ken was my best friend! Haven't they talked to Fry?
Haven't they asked him about the extinguisher?
They said that there was no such man employed at the plant as Fry.
Why, I saw him! I saw him twice!
Ken saw him, too! He was right there with us at the fire.
He handed me the extinguisher. Ken said, "Don't I get to play, too?"
He was kidding.
Fry was right there with us.
Why, he must have known there was gasoline in it.
He must have known!
He stood right there with us and watched, the...
Please go.
Don't you believe me?
Do you think I had something to do with this?
I didn't tell the police anything.
Oh, I don't know!
It's all so confused and so terrible.
I don't know what they're talking about! Why don't they get this fellow Fry?
You'd better go.
All right, I'll go.
I've got to get Fry.
I've got to find him, or Ken won't be the last one to die.
He must be in there. I saw him go in the back way.
Catchy.
What?
That tune you're whistling.
Oh, I didn't even know I was whistling.
That's a sign you must be pretty happy.
Easy to see there's nothing on your mind.
That must have been Junior. It felt like him. Junior?
Yeah, that rock we just got.
I know every one on the road from Los Angeles to Reno.
Tough job, driving a truck.
Got any other hot news tonight?
I guess I never realized how tough it was before.
The tough part, you can take that.
It's the monotony that gets you.
I've been thinking for a long time I'm gonna get out of this trucking game.
Why don't you?
One of the neighbors told my wife it's stylish to eat three meals a day.
You married?
Nope.
Go ahead and whistle.
That thing bother you?
What's doing it?
Here, stick this wad of paper in there, will you?
It's a pretty good thing to have around one of these extinguishers.
I wouldn't be without one.
Now, take the other day. A big lettuce truck turns over right down the road here.
The gasoline catches and she goes up like a matchbox.
A fellow riding, a friend of the driver's, gets caught in it.
If the driver hadn't had an extinguisher, his pal would've been fried alive right in front of his eyes.
I didn't see it happen. I never see anything happen.
I don't even hear about anything, except what my wife tells me what she sees in the moving pictures.
That's the way she spends the money, moving pictures and new hats.
Buys a new hat so she can put it on to go to the picture shows, so she can take it off.
No, sir. I haven't got anything to whistle about.
Where're you from, bud?
Los Angeles. Tough.
You work down there? Yeah.
Well, I did.
What doing?
I was working in an airplane factory.
They say that's pretty good. I was wondering why you weren't in the army.
Yeah.
I understand that they all go particular about the fellows they hire in those big defense plants.
Well, that's no more than right.
They got to be careful they don't get blown up.
Yeah.
I understand if a fellow would've had any kind of police record, no job. Is that right?
Oh, I don't know.
Hey, buddy, hold the wheel a while, will you?
While I animate this thing. I'm a nicotine addict.
Hey, watch it, bud, will you?
Stay on this side of the white line.
Where do you wanna get off when we get to Springville?
It doesn't matter. Just drop me in the middle of town, anywhere, when we get there.
Listen, the minute you get to Springville, you're in the middle of the town.
And the next minute, the place is just a memory.
Whole town isn't a city block long.
You going to one of those big ranches, outside, aren't you? Yeah.
I'd be glad to drop you off at whatever one you want.
That's it!
Deep Springs Ranch. Hey!
Say, that's a whale of a big place. Got a chance of a job there?
Yeah.
I think so.
You ought to like it. Nice climate.
The police!
Maybe something's happened!
I'd like to have a little talk with you out here.
Yeah, sure, sure, Officer.
Stay here a minute, buddy. I'll be right back.
Hey, bud! Come on.
Everything's fixed.
Good night, Officer.
Can you imagine a thing like that?
Cop chasing, the sirens, the whole works!
And what it's all about is one of my taillights went out.
That's the trucking game for you in a nutshell.
Calling all highway patrolmen. Calling all highway patrolmen.
Be on lookout for a man named Barry Kane.
Last seen on Highway 99.
He has dark brown hair, blue eyes, height about 6'2", no hat, around 25 years old.
Calling all highway patrolmen. Calling all highway patrolmen.
How do you do? Is Mr. Frank Fry here?
No, this is Mr. Tobin's ranch.
Could I speak to Mr. Tobin?
Well, I'll see.
Just a minute.
You wait here, please.
We've got the ball.
A young man to see you, sir.
Throw it to me. Where is Daddy's girl?
What did you say, Adele? Who wants to see me?
A young man, sir.
He came to ask for a Mr. Fry.
Well, have him come out here, will you?
Yes, sir. Throw me the ball. Throw me the ball.
Here comes your granddaddy.
Mr. Tobin will see you. Follow me, please. Hi.
How do you do?
I'm Charles Tobin. This is my daughter, Mrs. Brown.
How do you do?
How do you do?
Well, I'm not gonna ask you to excuse the informality of this costume.
We're all informal out here at Deep Springs Ranch.
That's one of the rules of the place.
I see.
Do you want me to take Susie with me so you won't be disturbed?
No, Susie isn't gonna disturb us at all.
You just let her play right here, and I'll see she doesn't fall in the pool.
All right.
Well, shall we sit out here?
Yes, sir.
It seems a shame to go indoors on such a beautiful day.
Yes, it does.
You wanted to see me about something, huh?
Yes, sir.
I'm looking for a man named Fry, Frank Fry.
I met him up in Los Angeles. I understand he lives here.
Oh, no, no.
Fry, huh? Frank Fry?
I'm afraid I don't know anybody by that name.
Wait a minute.
No, no. I've heard that name somewhere.
I just don't seem to be able to place it. Uh-huh.
There used to be a fellow with a name something like that, worked around here.
No. No.
It wasn't Fry.
Well, I'm afraid you found the wrong address.
It couldn't be one of the cowhands, or maybe somebody who is working... No.
No. I know the names of all my men.
Wait a minute.
My next door neighbor...
Well, next door neighbor, he lives 20 miles from here.
But he may know your friend. I'll telephone him.
Oh, no, please don't. No! Not at all.
You look as though you've had a hard journey.
It's just too bad you had to come all this way for nothing.
Now, if you'll just wait a minute, at least we can find out.
Will you see that Susie doesn't fall into the pool?
Hey.
Come here. Come over here.
Oh, so you're a ballplayer, are you?
Wanna throw me the ball?
Let me have it. Come on. Throw me the ball.
That's right. Throw me the other one. Come on.
Give me the ball.
That's fine. Fine! Now, I'll throw it back.
Where are you going?
Uh-oh. Don't do that.
Leave those where they are.
You wanna be a good girl?
Put these back where you found them.
No, no, Susie. The gentleman says put them back where you found them.
The gentleman knows that you must be very careful with letters that don't belong to you.
Probably I'm prejudiced, but it seems to me that Susie is a pretty cute young lady.
Yeah, she's great.
Where's Frank Fry?
Well, really, you must do something about that memory of yours.
You know that it wasn't a minute ago that you read a telegram that Fry sent me.
And it said that he was on his way to Soda City.
Don't you remember that?
Where's Soda City?
Well, I haven't given it much thought, but I wouldn't imagine there'd be an overabundance of Soda Citys on the map.
I suppose there's some way of finding out bringing you last-minute headlines.
Los Angeles.
The fire in the Stewart Aircraft Works, in which one man was killed, many injured, and half a million dollars worth of damage caused, has been definitely set down to sabotage.
Police have traced the incendiary origin of the blaze to Barry Kane, former aircraft...
Don't want any more of that.
You'd think you'd be rather bored with descriptions of yourself.
Or maybe you'll never get tired of them.
Well, I am, by this time. I've been listening to those radio reports all morning.
All right, you knew me. What about it?
Oh, quite a lot about it, Mr. Kane. You ought to know that.
You've become too famous to remain so modest.
Tell me one thing.
Why are you covering up Frank Fry?
What's a man like you in this for?
Well, young man, I don't know what you're talking about.
I think maybe you do!
Frank Fry is a saboteur who doesn't mind killing Americans for money.
You must watch yourself, Mr. Kane.
I'm telling you this for your own benefit, but you have the makings of an outstanding bore.
You can't get away with this, Tobin! Even if I don't stop you, there'll be others who will.
A man like you can't last in a country like this.
Very pretty speech.
Youthful, passionate, idealistic.
You see, I've already sent for the police.
You can't bluff me. You're hooked, and you know it.
Must I remind you that you are the fugitive from justice, and not I?
I'm a prominent citizen, widely respected.
You are an obscure young workman, wanted for the committing of an extremely unpopular crime.
Now, which of us do you think the police will believe, hmm?
Oh, you must think me a very poor host, Mr. Kane.
Now, don't you feel that a long cold drink is indicated?
Well, I guess I've found out everything you're gonna tell me.
I'll have to go on now and do the rest by myself.
You mean you wish to leave us?
Adele, Adele! Mr. Kane is going!
I'm sorry. You'll stop, please.
What does that shoot? Water?
Bullets, I'm afraid.
You shouldn't be so anxious to leave us, Mr. Kane.
You'll hurt our feelings.
You make it very hard for me to refuse your invitations.
Susie, come on.
No, no, Susie! Come here.
Hello, Susie.
You know where we're going?
We're going for a piggyback ride. That's right.
You like piggyback rides?
Dick, Joe!
Get after him!
Hurry up! Get him! Get after him!
Come on. Get going.
Wait a minute. You can't take me away like this!
Don't tell us what we can't do, chum. Go on, get started.
I tell you, you've got to get him!
Just because he's got a big ranch and a fancy pool and a lovely house doesn't mean he's a nice guy.
Why don't you find out the kind of things he's been doing?
Sure, sure. We know all about that.
Just come on along.
The baby had the letters, I tell you.
Oh, of course, Susie would be only too glad to cooperate, but, you see, it'll be quite a few months before she'll be of any assistance.
No, no, Susie.
Those are not for Susie.
Those are for the gentleman.
All right, let's go.
Where're we going?
We're gonna let you get a little idea of the county jail.
You won't find it the best in the West.
But it won't hurt you to rough it for a couple of days till they come up from Los Angeles for you.
You can't hold me without a warrant.
Chum, do I have to keep asking you not to tell us what we can't do?
I'm trying to explain! You give me a break. There isn't time!
Time's the one thing you don't need to worry about.
You'll have it to burn.
You'll have 20 years, nice and quiet, if you get the right lawyer.
And if you don't, you'll have all the time there is.
What's wrong, Mac?
What's holding us up?
Truck ahead, blocking the whole road.
Looks like they're changing a tire.
Got a cigarette?
Sure. All you want.
Hiya, bud!
Hey, what's the matter?
He went behind those rocks!
Not over here.
There he goes!
Hello there.
Hello.
I'm pretty wet, I'm afraid.
Maybe you'd like to come inside and get dry.
Did you leave your car down on the road?
Why don't you bring it up and put it in the shed?
I'm afraid it won't do it any good standing in the rain.
I don't have any car.
You might say I'm traveling by thumb.
By thumb?
Yeah, I'm a hitchhiker.
Oh, I see.
I've always thought that, that was the best way to learn about this country and the surest test of the American heart.
Yes, I guess it is.
Will you go to the fire and dry your clothes? Thanks.
Thanks.
I think that they'd dry more quickly if you hung them up and put on something of mine.
Oh, no, thanks! This is fine.
We could do with another log on the fire. Would you?
Why, sure.
You must stay until this blows over.
It won't detain you long.
These autumn storms are short.
They yield to none in wetness, but they are short.
Yes, I...
I'm sorry, I should have warned you.
Those logs are heavier than you'd think.
I drop them constantly.
Yes, they are heavy.
I guess I was too smart trying to pick it up with one hand.
Good job it didn't land on your foot.
That often happens to me.
You're lucky.
Yeah.
I'm lucky.
Oh, I was forgetting. My name is Phillip Martin.
Oh, I'm Barry...
Mason.
I'm glad you found yourself near here, Mr. Mason, when the storm came.
It's a pleasant thing to have a guest sharing the fire when the rain is beating on the roof.
You live here alone, do you, sir? Yes.
Except I really don't think of it in that way.
You see, sounds are my light and my colors.
My music, for example. I compose a little.
And there's nobody to tell me that the results are anything but brilliant, so I live in a comfortable glow of self-appreciation.
I'm afraid I prefer playing the works of other composers. Undoubtedly, you'd prefer listening to them.
I used to play the triangle in our high school band.
Of course that was a long time ago.
Oh, that's too bad.
It's unfortunate when you let yourself get out of practice on the triangle.
The piano is a boon to me.
The piano can't know that you're blind, so it doesn't embarrass you by trying to make things easier for you.
It does you the compliment to trust you.
Delius, the British composer, was blind too.
That's our only resemblance.
This is his Summer Night on the River.
A very interesting effect, obligato on an apple.
Oh, I apologize, Mr. Mason.
I forgot how hungry you must be after your long walk.
Just a moment. I'll get something. Oh, no.
Thanks. This is fine.
I like apples.
So do I. We'll save them for dessert.
It was all ready, you see.
All I needed was a reminder that I was hungry, too.
Are you dry enough?
Just about, sir.
It stopped raining.
Is that a car coming?
Two cars, I think.
Excuse me.
One car is my niece's. I'd know the sound of that motor anywhere.
The other is a stranger to me. There's a couple of men in it.
The girl's standing beside it, pointing down the road.
They must've asked her where to go.
This is an easy country to lose your way in. That's one of its charms.
The car is moving. It's starting off down the road now.
The girl's coming up the path.
That's my niece. She's been staying with me.
She comes from New York to spend a month with me every year.
It's one of my greatest pleasures.
Unhappily for me, she can't stay longer.
After a month she finds the quiet deafening.
Oh, Uncle Phillip.
Uncle Phillip, what do you think happened?
You didn't know we had a guest.
You turned your back and see what happens.
My niece, Patricia Martin, Mr. Mason.
How do you do?
Uncle Phillip, there was a car full of detectives down the road. They wanted to know the way to town.
They're searching for a man that got away from them.
It was on all the radios and everything. They said he's a really dangerous criminal. He...
My dear, the police are always on the alarmist side.
But they said this man is really dangerous.
I'm sure they did.
How could they be heroes if he were harmless?
Pat, dear, would you mind not having any further quotations from the police?
Their remarks are always so expected. They kill conversation.
You've probably seen the face of my niece before, Mr. Mason.
Why, yes. I was wondering where I'd seen...
As a matter of fact, you've seen her practically everywhere.
I'm told that billboards she adorns would reach across the continent, if placed end to end.
But I can't imagine who's going to place them end to end, nor why they should consider it the thing to do.
Uncle Phillip never has really been enthusiastic over my career as a model.
Oh, well, relatives are like that.
My, aren't you two mean, going ahead and eating without me.
I'm starving.
Would you pass me one of those plates, please, Mr. Mason?
What's the matter, Pat?
Have you just seen his handcuffs?
I heard them as soon as he came in.
Uncle Phillip, he must be the man they're looking for!
Yes, very probably.
But you should have given him to the police.
Are you frightened, Pat? Is that what makes you so cruel?
But you've got to! He's a dangerous man.
Mr. Mason may be many things, but he's certainly not dangerous.
In fact, I'm not at all convinced that he's guilty.
Uncle Phillip, it's your duty as an American citizen.
It is my duty as an American citizen to believe a man innocent until he's been proved guilty.
Pat, don't tell me about my duty.
It makes you sound so stuffy.
Besides, I have my own ideas about my duties as a citizen.
They sometimes involve disregarding the law.
But what are you going to do? What are you going to do with him?
I'm going to turn him over to you, my dear.
And you're going to drive him down to Tim, the blacksmith, and have those preposterous contraptions removed from his wrists.
Oh, Uncle Phillip, how could I do a thing like that?
Because, you know, I can see a great deal farther than you can.
I can see intangible things. For example, innocence.
Will you go with my niece, Mr. Mason?
Oh, yes, sir!
If you don't mind?
But what'll I tell the blacksmith?
Tell him Mr. Mason is my friend and my guest.
He won't ask any other questions.
Go ahead, Pat.
Go with her, Barry.
Barry, I know, is your name.
Your voice explained to me that Mason isn't.
But as I told you before, names are of such little importance.
I don't know how to thank you, Mr. Martin.
Go ahead, Barry.
Go ahead. And do the things I wish I could do.
Good luck, Barry, and for heaven's sake, get back in practice on that triangle!
Is the blacksmith's shop very far?
Not very, right along here.
And is he... Is he really all right?
He and my uncle are great friends.
I guess he's all right, then.
You needn't worry. He's all right. He's a darling blacksmith.
Only I'm not quite sure how much experience he's had with handcuffs.
Do you mind if I see them?
I wonder what he'll have to do to get them off.
I can't quite see. Could you hold them a little nearer?
Now I feel better.
I'll bet you do.
I'll bet this just makes you feel great, doesn't it?
In case you're interested, the blacksmith's shop is two miles back. We're on our way to the police.
Your uncle's certainly gonna be proud of you!
The world isn't full of kind old gentlemen, like my uncle.
You're gonna find that out. Even my uncle wouldn't have been so kind if he'd known more about you.
All right, go ahead. What did I do? I'd be kind of happy to know.
If it had been any other sort of crime, if a man had stolen because he was starving, even if a man committed murder to defend himself, maybe I wouldn't tell the police.
But there's only one reason why a man commits sabotage. That's worse than murder.
Surprise for you, Miss Martin, I agree with every word you say.
Please don't talk to me anymore.
That will be my pleasure.
Well!
I'll see that she doesn't!
Never try driving this way. It hurts.
I'm stopping the first car I see.
Help!
I can't get along without you.
Let go of me!
Help!
Get the police!
Help!
My, they must be terribly in love.
Looks as though this car has been overheated. Fan's broken.
I'm cold.
Yeah, I know. And you're hungry.
Now mostly I'm cold.
Look, if you'd stop trying to be a hero and decide to be on my side, maybe we could do something about your being cold.
Build a fire?
No, I wasn't exactly thinking of that.
Well, I didn't want to insult you by not even trying.
What do you want to turn me in for? Haven't you got your picture stuck up in enough places now?
I just want to do my duty. That's hard for you to understand.
Why won't you believe I'm all right?
'Cause you still don't make sense.
If you really hadn't done it, you would've gone to the police.
I've told you it's a question of time! If I go to the police, it'd take me weeks to convince them.
If they're as dumb as you are, it'll take me months.
Do you think we're very far from Soda City?
I don't know.
We'll ask at the next town, if there's a next town.
Well, anyway, I don't believe that part about Tobin.
You don't believe it because he's got a big ranch and a beautiful pool and...
It's just hard to believe that about any American.
Well, you believe it about me!
Well, you're different. You look like a saboteur.
You have a saboteur's disposition.
Don't tell me you've decided to be on my side.
No, I'm cold.
Say, aren't you wasting your very valuable time, sitting up here admiring the scenery?
Hey, look at that.
Looks like we've got company.
What do you suppose all that's doing way up here?
They aren't moving very fast, are they?
You know what we can do?
Oh, no, you won't.
Sorry, honey, I can't take a chance.
You're right. I'd turn you in at the first opportunity I get.
Let go of me!
Help! Help!
Won't you give me one break?
Won't you wait till we get to Soda City?
All right. I'm sorry I've got to leave you here alone.
But I told you what I've got to do, and I'm gonna do it.
There's only one thing I want to warn you about, snakes.
There're a lot of them out here.
Of course, there's only five or six poisonous kinds, but there are a lot of the long, squirmy, slippery, slimy ones.
Barry!
I'm coming up in the world. Now I'm better than the snakes.
Barry, please!
Are you with me?
Yes, yes!
Now, what made you change your mind?
I can't turn you in if I'm stuck out there.
Oh, so that's it. Go back with the reptiles.
Let me go!
Who's there?
You've got no right here!
Stop it and get off!
Now, now, Major.
Ah, stowaways.
In the middle of this desert sea, we acquire two more vagabonds.
Bedouins like ourselves, eh, Esmeralda?
Why, they're just a couple of kids.
Our car broke down a way back, and we walked for miles.
We saw your bus and hopped on. We didn't want to wake you at this hour.
Broke down, eh?
We didn't pass no wrecks on the highway.
The whole thing sounds like a pack of lies.
You see, we were off on a side road.
I know. A moonlight night and a parked car. That's nice.
Oh, no, really, we were just...
Esmeralda!
Everywhere you search for sex.
Get your eyes out of the mud and look up at the stars.
Oh, I beg your pardon.
My name is Bones.
I am also known as the human skeleton.
How do you do?
And this is Esmeralda, our bearded lady.
Naturally, we're very proud to have her as a member of our group.
You poor kids must be tired. Come on in and sit down, have a little rest.
We're trying to get to a place called Soda City, a couple of hundred miles north, I think.
Well, then, you won't get there till morning, so make yourselves comfortable.
You must meet our other co-worker,
Tatania, our little human mountain.
A very great lady, indeed. How do you do?
What goes on there?
Oh, did we wake you, honey? That's too bad.
Oh, I was awake.
I wish you'd tell Mignonette to do something about that insomnia of hers.
I've been tossing and turning all night.
I wish you'd tell Marigold to shut her silly old face.
Are you girls not speaking to each other again? Dear, dear.
Marigold's mad because I got her beau away from her back in the last town we played.
Kindly tell Mignonette I heard that last remark, that I wouldn't have the gentleman in question as a gift.
Nothing but a common novelty-seeker.
Girls, girls! What will our guests think?
Hey, he's cute!
You hear that?
There she goes again.
Stop your squabbling.
They are tired. They've been walking for miles!
Nobody gave you a lift?
I know.
The normal are normally cold-hearted.
Stop gabbing and get these tramps off!
A cold heart, partly reduced in size.
I won't take no insults.
Get them off.
Aw, Major, honey...
Don't "honey" me!
I've got a contract. It provides for safe transportation, and it don't say nothing about picking up hobos.
That's the police, all right.
They must be looking for somebody.
Who could they want?
Me, I guess.
The carefree youth, and he has handcuffs on.
What do they want you for?
For something somebody else did.
I don't believe he's done anything wrong!
I'll go to bat for him anytime.
I've always told Mignonette she'd get mixed up with the police if she wasn't careful.
They're starting to search at the front.
Well, what are you waiting for?
Hand him over to the police.
He's perfectly right.
He's a little stinker.
Seems like a terrible thing to do, but it'd be terrible, too, if we got into trouble...
All right, Bones, call the cops!
Just a minute, Major.
In this situation, I find a parallel for the present world predicament.
We stand defeated at the outset.
You, Esmeralda, have sympathy, and yet you're willing to remain passive and let the inevitable happen.
I have a belief, and yet I'm tempted to let myself be over-ridden by force.
The rest of you, with the exception of this malignant jerk, are ignorant of the facts, and, therefore, confused.
Thank heaven we're still members of a democracy.
We'll put the matter to a vote.
No vote. I'm against voting!
Fascist!
You know how we stand so far.
The twins, as usual, are on opposite sides, and so their votes pair.
Tatania's on both sides at once and therefore neutral.
The Major is for delivering these young people to the police, and I, frankly, am against it.
Esmeralda, the decision is up to you.
Well, I don't want any trouble any more than anybody else, but while you've been talking, I've been looking at something, something pretty fine, too.
I've been looking at that little girl there standing right beside that poor young man.
Never a word. Never a question.
Taking everything he's had to take, stringing along with him, whatever happens.
And I've been thinking, it's the good people that stick when anybody's in trouble, and there aren't many good people in the world.
I think that we, all of us, know that better than most.
And, well, it isn't something you see every day of the week, so I vote...
We don't give them up.
Good girl, Esmeralda.
This is subversive! I won't stand for it!
Oh, no, you don't, cuddles!
You'll abide by the will of the majority.
Back into your places and pretend to be asleep. That's all you have to do.
Here, honey, you sit right down here.
Come on, young man, we've got to hide you.
Turn all the lights off. Here.
Take off your coat and put this on.
Come on. Wake up in there!
Hey, what is this?
Halloween?
Police.
Oh, is that so? Haven't you got anything better to do than waking up law-abiding citizens in the middle of the night?
We're looking for a young man and his woman companion.
He's got dark hair, between the age of 20 and 25.
The dame's supposed to be good-looking. Have you seen them?
Now, where would I see anybody as normal as that?
Who's this?
Doesn't look like one of your troop.
Sure, she's one of us.
She's our little snake charmer.
Right now she's sitting on a box of snakes so they don't get lonesome.
Can you imagine that?
And a good-looking gal, too.
Well, I guess you can all go back to sleep now.
A snake charmer! Well, well.
You never can tell about women.
It's all right. You can come out now.
Wait, justice, come back!
Sit down here!
We're on our way.
I don't know how I can thank you, sir.
It's all right, my boy.
It gives you a good feeling when you can help somebody.
You people have a right to know what this is all about.
It's all right, son. If that little girl of yours can trust you, I guess we can.
The baby! She's had a tough time.
Poor little girl. She's worn out.
I'll take care of her.
Come on. Let's go.
Better let the snakes get some sleep.
They have to look good tomorrow.
I'm sorry.
What for?
For being such a dope. I was scared.
You'd have been a dope if you hadn't been scared.
You're tired, that's all that's the matter with you.
Get some sleep. You'll be fine.
I can go to sleep, all right.
I'm so tired.
I want to tell you something.
I believe you.
Do you, Pat?
You didn't, you know.
It's a free country. A girl can change her mind, can't she?
Sure, she can.
Thank you, Pat.
They made me so ashamed.
They're so nice and trusting.
They're wonderful people, all except that nasty little Major and the mean twin.
I don't suppose you can really blame the fat lady though, when a woman has lost her figure that way.
Welcome to Soda City.
The heart of the bicarbonate belt.
Well, we might as well do the town.
There's nothing here.
I suppose we are a little late.
I'm sorry, darling.
I knew I shouldn't have brought you here.
I'm not complaining.
This is great, isn't it?
Solution to all my problems.
I was counting on this place.
A dump like this, 5,000 miles from nowhere.
Look at this.
It's been in use.
Let's go around to the window.
Careful! Don't cut yourself.
Hello? Hello?
Hung up.
What sort of phone is that?
It's a field telephone.
Well, a room with a view.
What do you suppose they cut that for?
I don't know.
Say, look.
Tripod.
Looks like it's the right height.
Something else goes with this.
There!
That's it.
See anything?
Not yet.
Let me see!
Why, that's a...
Why, Barry!
Yeah.
We better put this away.
Say!
The wood.
What about it?
They wouldn't burn that in a stove.
Why not?
The smoke would show.
That's a car.
You better hide.
No, not here.
What do you think you're doing around here?
I was wondering when you'd get here.
Where are you from?
What are you sniffing around here for?
Excuse me.
Funny, you knowing about this place.
You might have thought it over more carefully.
Your coming here doesn't help us a bit.
The heat's on this guy and he shows up here.
Tobin sent me.
The old man must be off his nut sending him up here.
Be a little more careful, Neilson. Your criticisms in front of other people.
Yeah.
Don't talk that way about the old guy.
I'll watch out for myself, Doc.
Me, too. Don't forget about me. That's why Tobin sent me up here.
He said you'd know how to take care of me.
I guess that makes it pretty clear, Neilson.
I don't know. A guy walks in out of the desert, and right away I get orders.
It ain't so clear to me.
I'm a little better than a stranger, friend, if you'll remember my press clippings.
Yes.
Mr. Kane has done pretty well down South.
His accomplishments can't be disregarded, at least I hope not.
A man that has served as well as he has is entitled at least to recognition.
I'm entitled to more than that. Protection, too.
You guys have got to take care of me.
I'm sure the firm will do its best.
They're known to be quite loyal to their employees.
Neilson will see to it that the firm's record is maintained.
You got it easy, you guys from back East.
You give orders. You do that, all right.
The big boys with the desk jobs.
All you got to do is reach for a telephone, sit back in a big leather chair, and us guys out here have got to take the rap.
You know, I think I'll go back East and work for a while.
You're not a very good example of loyalty to the firm.
Yeah? Well, I'm getting just a little bit tired, see.
So am I! I'm getting tired of all this talk. Let's get going!
The trip up here was no pushover. I had to hoof it most of the way.
I got no place to hide you out. That ain't my line.
That ain't your line, huh?
What about you?
You don't seem so interested, either!
Or I suppose you're just the big brains! Or maybe you take a chance now and then just for laughs.
Or maybe it doesn't work that way.
Maybe I'm the only guy that sticks his neck out. Well, get this, both of you!
I pulled a big job and they're after me.
And you guys are gonna take care of me and do it right, or you're gonna have trouble on your hands.
I've got to get out of this part of the country!
The ground's burning up under my feet!
I've got to get back East!
It's a little more crowded back there. A guy doesn't stand out like he does here.
Hey, take it easy. Hang on to your nerve.
I've been hanging on to my nerves! I've been hanging on long enough!
I understand your difficulties.
I'm sorry about all the talk. But in this business, we always have to make sure.
I think I know him now.
I'm driving back East, you know. You'd better come with me.
All right, let's get going.
Get all the things together.
After we leave, I want this place cleaned up. You won't be coming back here. Why not?
You think they got the place spotted?
I'm making sure. You'll have to find another place and store all this stuff.
Well, it's not gonna be easy.
It's your job. If you can't handle it, I'll have to get someone else.
All right. I'll handle it.
You'll need some clothes.
Size 42.
What'll we do about these?
Hmm. How did you manage to break them?
On an automobile fan.
That's very bright of you.
I think we can even take care of that, but let's get started now.
Did you hear something?
Where does that lead to?
Just another room.
The way out.
You see, we figure that Kane and the other fellows are probably heading for New York.
If there's anything I can do...
We sure appreciate that.
Why, anyone would have done the same thing.
That's right, this war sure makes a difference.
Everybody wants to get in and pitch.
Now, if you'll just give me your address in New York, Miss Martin, we can contact you back there.
Or maybe you could wire me about which plane you're taking.
We may want to get a hold of you fast.
Well, I can do that when I get back to my uncle.
Okay, Miss Martin, just keep in touch.
I'm glad we came this way.
It adds a few miles to our trip, but somehow I've become a little sentimental.
I want to take a last look at it.
Beautiful, isn't it?
A great monument to man's unceasing industry and his stubborn faith in the future.
You'll be moving along soon.
Are you carrying any cameras or firearms at all?
Nothing at all, Officer.
You, sir?
No, sir.
They must get a lot of power from this dam.
I think it supplies about 75% for the Los Angeles district, naturally including most of the power for the defense plants there.
Well, do you think there's any...
Do you know Tobin very well?
No, not very well. I met him just that once at his ranch.
Did he have the child with him?
His grandchild? Yes.
He seemed to be very fond of her.
That's one of the things I like about old Tobin, his love for that little girl.
Evidence of a good heart.
I have children, too, you know. Oh?
Two boys. Nice little fellows. Aged two and four.
The four-year-old is naughty at times. He's quite a problem.
We get him a new toy and within half an hour it's smashed to bits.
And then, sometimes, after it's all over, he seems almost sorry.
Sometimes I wish my younger child had been a girl.
In fact, my wife and I often argue over a little idiosyncrasy I have.
I don't want his hair cut short until he's much older.
Do you think it'd be bad for him?
Well, I don't know, it might be.
When I was a child, I had long golden curls.
People used to stop on the street to admire me.
Things are different nowadays.
If you gave the kid a haircut, it might save him a lot of grief.
Ah, we're on our way.

Drive to 401 instead of the office.
Anything wrong?
Plenty. I've just called the office. They've disconnected the phone.
Same old phone company. Should have paid the bill.
This is no time for jokes.
The police. They're watching the office.
The disconnected phone, it's our signal.
You think they're watching for me?
I don't know.
Who'd know you were in New York?
Oh, yeah. I guess you're right.
How about Brooklyn tomorrow? Do you want me on the job?
When are you going to learn to keep your mouth shut?
Sorry. I thought he was in on it.
Shut up!
It's all right. I'm good at keeping secrets.
Let's go.
Good evening, Mr. Freeman.
Hi, Mr. Freeman.
Hello.
Ah, pleased to see you, Mr. Freeman. Have a good trip? Yes.
Thank you, Robert.
Madam is upstairs. She's waiting anxiously for you.
Oh, thank you, Robert. We'll go right up.
This way.
Who's that?
Hey, is this a hotel?
What's the festivity?
It's for a very worthy cause.
Mrs. Sutton often gives her house over to charity affairs.
She's a very generous woman.
I have an idea she isn't going to be really pleased to see us on a night like this.
Idiots, all of you.
Stupid, inefficient idiots.
Everything is left to me.
I have to hover over all of you like an old hen.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Sutton.
The guests downstairs expect me to put in an appearance.
After all, as you say, they want something for their $25!
I will not have my benevolence abused.
My life, my position, they're important to me.
I'll do my best, Mrs. Sutton.
I only wish your best were a little better.
Oh. Mr. Freeman, I'm glad you've come at this time.
I was just telling Edward...
Is this the young man?
Must you bring him here, as well?
I certainly can't furnish him with sanctuary.
This house is full of guests, important people!
Don't you understand my position, Mr. Freeman, with this young man here?
The police are already watching your office.
Thank goodness they'll never come here.
But a little more of your stupid behavior and even the respectability of my house won't shield you.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Sutton. We can't leave any loose ends.
All right! All right!
But for heaven's sake, stop playing the conspirator.
Now tell me all you know about the girl or ask him.
Why didn't you tell me about the young lady back in Soda City?
Well, I didn't think it was important. She was just a girl, like anybody else.
She picked me up, she was pretty.
I guess it was kind of risky.
Well, there you are.
I'm so sorry to have exposed you to any risk.
What's she doing here?
You're surprised to see me again.
How did you get here?
It doesn't matter how she got here.
The point is there was no reason to bring her here at all!
You see, Mr. Kane,
I just learned on the telephone at the gas station that she was most indiscreet after she left you at Soda City.
She went straight to the local sheriff, who, fortunately, happened to be a particularly good friend of ours.
Oh, don't waste time in explanations, Mr. Freeman.
You've got to get the girl out of this house, all of you. I will not have my benevolence abused!
So you played smart.
That's great. That's a big help to all of us.
No, I wasn't smart at all.
I haven't been smart for four days.
Even when I went to the sheriff I hesitated.
I hated to do anything that might get you into trouble.
Yeah, I sympathize.
The mistake I made was not leaving you back there with the snakes!
You might have at least learned to rattle.
I was right about you in the first place.
Good evening, Mr. Kane.
I didn't know you were a bookworm.
You must let me choose something appropriate for you. Something not too difficult for you to understand.
Let me see.
Here we are.
This will do admirably. Remarkable work.
Somehow prophetic.
Why are you here, Charles?
And what's all this nonsense about books?
I am a refugee.
I have at last joined that revolting group of world travelers.
One ultimately turns into the thing one despises most.
And whom have I to thank for it?
You, Mr. Freeman.
The girl was allowed to escape unobserved. She left Mr. Kane, went straight to her uncle.
And that charming old man went to the police.
As a result, a whole hoard of officers came to my house.
Luckily, I was leaving when they arrived.
And the others, the very loyal ones, well, they're paying for their loyalty.
How appalling!
Your charming house. I'm so sorry, Charles.
It's rather lucky.
You might have been sorrier.
And you might have been a little more efficient in this whole matter, Mr. Freeman!
What good is it going to do you to insult me? We're in trouble now.
And so the most important thing is to make sure of everyone around us.
Of Mr. Kane?
I'm just not sure.
I want to know that he's all right.
All right?
What an understatement.
He's much more than that!
He's noble and fine and pure.
And so he pays the penalty that the noble and the fine and the pure must pay in this world.
He's misjudged by everyone.
Why, even the police have a completely erroneous impression of him.
I can assure you that contrary to what is supposed and to what he may himself have told you, that young man is certainly not one of his country's enemies.
Charles, you're joking!
I mean exactly what I say.
Mr. Kane is definitely no part of our little organization.
Your protégé. Well, you've done splendidly. You bring him here, you idiot.
Now what in heaven's name are we going to do with him?
That's a very appropriate question.
Not much we can do with him.
I made the mistake once of turning him over to the police.
That's even more impossible at the moment.
I'm afraid there's only one thing we can do.
You see, the new law threatens all of us with the death penalty.
So, I'm afraid we'll have to apply the ancient axiom.
Tooth for a tooth.
Kane for a Tobin.
Please don't discuss things of that sort here.
It's rather nauseating and quite out of place.
Oh, Charles, I'm frightened.
We must take all precaution.
Of course. We must also continue with our work.
It's too risky now.
We're already abandoning the dam. We must remain inactive for a while.
Inactive?
You are utterly mistaken.
Once we do that, our organization is finished.
We must carry on at all costs.
What about tomorrow's work?
Tomorrow's work? You can't abandon that after all your preparations.
But, Charles, the risk...
Is great. I know that.
Unfortunately, we will have to carry out our orders.
I am leaving for the Caribbean now.
My position here is more impossible than all of yours.
Of course I'm rather looking forward to Central America.
Havana will be very gay this season.
You know, somehow I've suddenly had enough of this country.
The war has made it grim.
You're leaving us here to face everything, and you'll be on a boat sailing along.
It all sounds idyllic.
Oh, Charles, Charles, this whole thing, it's impossible.
It's panicky.
I'm deeply sorry.
There you are, darling! How unbecoming for a hostess to hide herself away.
Am I intruding?
I am so sorry, but I just must kidnap Henrietta. She'll be back.
I've had some trouble with these people. They're doing the catering and making rather a horrid mess of it.
Our boy will appear any minute with the caviar! I assure you. I'll stake my reputation on it.
Don't be a fool!
Get to the house phone. How'd you get here?
They met me at the airport.
I thought they were the police, then they brought me here.
Wait a minute.
No use trying the way I came in.
Let's walk right out through the front door!
Yes, sir. We'll watch the back exit. They won't get out.
No good.
See the one on the other side? I met him on the way in.
He's one of them. We'll never get out that way.
What can they do to us?
They'd grab us. We wouldn't have a chance.
But these people would see them do it.
Of course. And if anyone had a question, we're a couple of gatecrashers.
Barry, this is awful. It's like a bad dream.
All these people here. Isn't there anyone we can trust?
Sure there is. All of them. Only which one?
Excuse me.
This may sound sort of crazy.
In fact, I don't even know how to start.
But this whole house is a hotbed of spies and saboteurs.
I'm not being silly. I assure you. Even our hostess, Mrs. Sutton.
What's the matter with you, sir?
You're drunk!
You're not even dressed.
What'd he say?
Oh, he thinks I'm drunk.
When I read in the papers what those Japs are doing...
Yeah, man.
Stay in that pitch.
Pardon me. Did you pay $25 to get in here tonight?
No, not exactly. My boss gave me a ticket. Why?
I need your help very badly.
We're in the middle of the biggest bunch of fifth columnists in the country.
Are you kidding? What's the gag?
No, I'm on the level. This is it.
Aw, you're kidding. We got a wag on the joint. The guy's trying to rib me.
Aw, sling him your curve.
Beat it out, son. Beat it out.
Excuse me, sir.
I'd like to talk to you about something very important.
What is it, Mr. Kane?
You know it's hopeless.
Why don't you join Mr. Tobin upstairs for a little supper?
I'll show you the way.
Barry, before they get to us, go out and stop the music and tell them! Tell them all!
Honey, this is the Sutton mansion. I'm just a guy from Glendale, California, wanted by the police.
They'll grab me as soon as I open my mouth.
What are you gonna do? We can't just stand here.
I know where we'll be safe.
Barry, I'm scared.
It's so unreal, all these people dancing and having a good time.
Yeah. And when you try to warn them, they laugh at you. They think you're drunk.
That gray-haired man you spoke to, he seemed like such an honest citizen.
Just a friend of the family.
I guess the room's well sprinkled with them.
They're so smart. That's what frightens me.
Yeah, they're smart, that's because they're ruthless.
It's easy to win when you forget about the rules.
A man named Fry drops a wallet in California and we wind up here, you and me.
That's the only good part of it, I'm with you.
I wish it were somewhere else.
The North Pole, I wouldn't care.
We might wind up there yet, too, chasing Fry over the old glacier!
Fry. He seems so small now. I'd forgotten about him.
So had I.
Well, we can't just go on dancing like it's Saturday night at The Palladium.
We can't just wait till they come and get us.
What do you think they'll really do?
Oh, right now they're probably haggling over the price with Murder Incorporated.
Oh, Barry, please!
Sorry, Pat.
I hate to be out of it now there's still so much to do.
If ever there was a time when staying alive was important, you heard what they said.
Something about a job they are going to do tomorrow in Brooklyn.
The Navy Yard.
One of us has got to get out of here.
Maybe if I start something, you can make a break for it.
Well, what about you?
You can't worry about me. We got to take a chance.
Oh, Barry, why couldn't I have met you 100 years ago on a beach somewhere?
Bathing suits looked awfully funny 100 years ago.
I'll bet you'd look beautiful, though.
Afraid we're not behaving very well.
What's the difference?
We weren't invited anyway.
Pat, this moment belongs to me.
No matter what happens, they can never take it away from me.
Oh, pardon me. Do you mind?
Oh, excuse me.
Would you care to dance?
Why, yes. Certainly.
Oh, you're really a much better dancer.
Thanks.
Who was the man you were dancing with?
I have no idea. I never saw him before.
No, I mean the man that just left you.
I know. That's who I'm talking about.
I never saw him before in my life.
Oh, what a pity. That was lovely.
I hope you will ask me again.
Oh, thanks. Thanks a lot.
Well, young man, you seem to be enjoying yourself.
Charming party, isn't it?
Where is she?
You mean your young lady?
I thought you were taking care of her.
Perhaps she has a headache and lying down somewhere.
Would you like to come with me and look for her?
Hold on.
Ladies and gentlemen. Ladies and gentlemen!
Your attention, please.
I have something to tell you.
Something you ought to know about this house and about your hostess.
I beg your pardon, sir, but before you go on, I think you might like to take a look at the curtain on the balcony.
I'm not much of a public speaker, ladies and gentlemen, and some of you are probably wondering how I can tell you anything about your hostess that you don't already know.
Her graciousness, her kindness, her many charities.
Well, I want to tell you that you have a big surprise coming, ladies and gentlemen.
Tonight, in this house, for the benefit of this great cause for which she's already done so much, our hostess, Mrs. Sutton, is putting up for auction one of her most treasured possessions, one of the famous Sutton jewels.
Mrs. Sutton, would you kindly step forward?
Mr. Kane, the young lady is asking to see you.
Are you sure?
I wouldn't keep her waiting if I were you, sir.
Will someone please...
Admiral, how about you? Would you take over for me, please?
Excuse me, please.
I'm wanted on the phone.
Delighted, sir.
Thank you.
Ladies and gentlemen, I will entertain your bids for this beautiful bracelet, which has been donated by our hostess, Mrs. Sutton.
What am I bid?
$1,000.
$1,000 has been bid. Do I hear any more?
$1,500.
$1,500 has been bid. Do I hear?
$1,750.
$2,000.
$2,000 has been bid for this beautiful bracelet.
Where is she?
You seem to have a soft spot for that young lady.
You can't afford to make yourself that vulnerable, not when you're out trying to save your country.
Why is it that you sneer every time you refer to this country?
You've done pretty well here. I don't get it.
No, you wouldn't. You're one of the ardent believers, the good American.
Oh, there are millions like you. People that plod along without asking questions.
I hate to use the word stupid, but it seems to be the only one that applies.
The great masses, the moron millions.
Well, there are a few of us who are unwilling to just troop along.
A few of us who are clever enough to see that there's much more to be done than just live small, complacent lives.
A few of us in America who desire a more profitable type of government.
When you think about it, Mr. Kane, the competence of totalitarian nations is much higher than ours.
They get things done.
They get things done.
They bomb cities, sink ships, torture and murder, so you and your friends can eat off a gold plate.
It's a great philosophy.
I neither intend to be bombed nor sunk, Mr. Kane.
That's why I'm leaving now.
And if things don't go right for you, if we should win, then I'll come back.
Perhaps I can get what I want then, power.
I want that as much as you want your comfort, or your job, or that girl.
We all have different tastes, as you can see.
Only I'm willing to back my tastes with the necessary force.
You certainly make it sound smooth and easy.
Well, that's a trick.
I know the results of that power you believe in.
It killed my friend, and it's killing thousands like him. That's what you're aiming at.
But it doesn't bother you, I can see that.
Because you really hate all people.
Let me tell you something.
The last four, five days I've learned a lot.
I've met guys like you and I've met others, people that are helpful and eager to do the right thing, people that get a kick out of helping each other fight the bad guys.
Love and hate.
The world's choosing up sides. I know who I'm with.
And there are a lot of people on my side, millions of us in every country.
And we're not soft. We're plenty strong.
And we'll fight standing up on our two feet, and we'll win. Remember that, Mr. Tobin.
We'll win, no matter what you guys do.
We'll win if it takes from now until the cows come home.
Mr. Kane, I think we've discussed the rights of man sufficiently.
I'm feeling a little tired.
You must be, too.
Robert, do you think you can arrange for Mr. Kane to sleep somewhere tonight?
Yes, sir. Certainly, sir.
That's enough, Robert.
Very good, sir.
Think you can take care of this?
Yes, sir.
Will that be all, sir?
Yes, thank you.
It doesn't matter what arrangements we've made, to what trouble we've gone.
This whole job hangs on one thing, timing.
If the section of the slipway goes up before the actual moment of launching, then all our efforts have been wasted.
If you blow her too late, well, then you just scare the crowd.
Timing, timing, timing.
That button must not be pressed until the ship starts to move.
What arrangements have been made for getting out of there?
As soon as the camera cables are unhooked, this truck goes.
We got a fix at the gate to get through without failing.
Who's handling the camera near the slipway?
I am.
The wires to the explosives were laid last night.
All I have to do is hook them up to the camera.
Too bad we have to lose a good camera.
Well, everything seems to be taken care of.
I'll be waiting for you at the newsreel office.
Have they gone?
How is she?
Okay.
She's having her breakfast.
Any trouble keeping her quiet? No.
I made a deal with her.
You see, she got tired of having that adhesive tape over her eyes and mouth.
Well, I hope we get rid of her soon.
I promised to take my kid sister to the Philharmonic.
Give me the key.
There it is.
I'm sorry we couldn't keep you at the house last night, but Mrs. Sutton has a limited number of guest rooms, and I suppose Mr. Kane was first in line.
Where am I?
Oh, that's a trade secret.
I only hope it isn't too high for you here.
Mr. Kane's quarters are nearer the ground, but he's being well looked after, and, like you, is probably enjoying a hearty breakfast.
Whose place is that?
That's Mrs. Sutton's house.
Oh, who's she?
Some rich dame.
Saw something in the paper about her doing things for charity.
Right here somewhere. Here.
What about tomorrow's work?
Tomorrow's work? You can't abandon that after all your preparations.
But, Charles, the risk...
Is great. I know that.
Unfortunately, we will have to carry out our orders.
What's the time?
10:50.
Thanks.
Brooklyn Navy Yard, quick!
How much?
15.
Got change?
Courtesy of the Navy Department, we are now able to take you to the Brooklyn Navy Yard, where over a national hook-up we will endeavor to bring you a description of the actual launching ceremony of the Navy's capital ship, the USS Alaska.
And so without further ado, we switch you now to the Brooklyn Navy Yard.
Here we are at the Brooklyn Navy Yard.
It's rather a windy autumn day, but still it's a pretty good day for a launching.
I guess any day is a good day for a launching in these times.
Our microphones are located in several key spots, so we'll be able to bring you...
What's holding us up?
Traffic, buddy. What do you think?
Here. I'll walk.
Okay.
Ladies and gentlemen, I am now turning you over to Bill Donnan, who is located on the actual platform.
Go ahead, Bill.
This is Bill Donnan, ladies and gentlemen. We're located up here on the platform, right below the bow of the great ship.
It towers over us like some enormous monster. This platform on which we have...
Take me to the guy in charge!
Okay. I'll take care of this. What do you want?
Something's gonna happen at the launching, sabotage.
Where'd you get your information?
I can't say now. There isn't time.
What can I do? We got to have a little more than that to go on.
Better come in the office and talk to the chief.
I tell you there isn't time!
What do you expect me to do?
Take me to the guy in charge of the launching.
No, you got to go through the office first.
Very crowded at the moment with all kinds of Navy officers...
Wait here.
I can see in the group to my left Rear Admiral Pierce and Mrs. Pierce.
It is Mrs. Pierce who will perform the actual bottle breaking today.
She is shaking hands with a great many people down there right now.
Just a second, ladies and gentlemen. I see Rear Admiral Pierce moving toward the microphone. Yes.
We'll switch you over to the speaker's microphone.
The launching of a ship in a time of war is always a solemn occasion.
Today, when our fleet is fighting on all the seven seas, this ceremony gains magnitude for it represents, for the American people, a victory.
I don't know. He just stepped outside.
...by the strong, diligent of hands of American workmen.
Let us rejoice, then, at this moment.
Let us be confident working for this great country to show the world what America can do. Our American soldiers, who are freely giving their lives, so that we in this country can live in decency, security and peace.
This is Bill Donnan again, ladies and gentlemen.
You've just heard Rear Admiral Pierce speaking from the Brooklyn Navy Yard.
His speech is being received with great applause...
Lock the back doors, quick!
I can handle this!
Be ready to pull out as soon as she goes.
The naval officer is handing her a bottle of champagne that is tied somewhere above it.
The crowd is tense. It is indeed a solemn occasion.
I switch you over to our microphone near the bow of the ship so that you may hear the actual launching.
Now I can see that Mrs. Pierce is moving towards the bow of the ship.
I'll switch you over now to Mrs. Pierce.
In the name of the people of the United States, I christen thee Alaska.
What's the trouble?
Don't know. An explosion somewhere.
George!
Everything okay?
No, give us a hand.
We got a guy.
Better scatter. Go down the corridor and through the iron door.
It will take you to the music hall.
We'll go this way.
You must go, go at once, before Henry catches you here.
See here, I thought you wanted to make the old boy jealous.
Not anymore. He's threatened to kill you on sight.
Oh, I say, you don't think he'd go that far, do you?
Of course he will. Oh, will you go before it's too late, before he shoots you to death?
See here, are you trying to tell me Old Henry's got a gun, a real gun?
What do you think this is?
I've caught you at last, you rat in the grass!
Stop that!
Run, Wilbur, run! Before he gets your range!
I think I got it now. Get out before I shoot again!
Run, Wilbur, run!
It never touched me!
My husband! He's shot!
I'll kill the rat if it's the last thing I do!
He was only kidding. I swear!
And I'm only kidding, too!
Get out of here!
He's gone mad! Mad!
Go on. Get out! Get out!
Not that way! He'll kill you!
Murder! Help!
Run, for heaven's sake! Run for your life!
There he goes!
He's the one you're after.
You're the one we're after. Come on!
I tell you, he's the one. He'll get away! Come on!
Pat, grab a cab and go after him and don't lose him.
Taxi!
Downtown.
Whereabouts?
Anywhere. Just keep going downtown.
May I have change for the telephone, please?
Yes, ma'am.
There you are.
Operator?
Give me the FBI headquarters, please.
Federal Bureau of Investigation.
Hold on, I'll put you through.
Make sure he doesn't leave by the next boat. Talk to him, follow him.
Do your best to keep him there until our men come along.
A girl says she thinks she's traced Fry to Bedloe Island.
She's crazy. He'd never go there.
Where did you pick up Schultz last month?
In that museum, that modern art place. And Renaldo?
You caught him looking at the fish in the aquarium, didn't you?
Yeah, but the statue's a dead end.
That's why he's smart. You better get going.
Let me take him along in any case, just to make sure the girl hasn't made a mistake.
Burke, you're one of the most obstinate men I've ever met! Get going.
Come on.
Pardon me. Could you tell me which is Brooklyn?
I've seen you before, haven't I?
Sure.
On that boat coming over.
What'd you ask me?
About Brooklyn, I was wondering where it was. I've heard so much about it.
Over there.
Where are you from?
New York.
What are you handing me?
Oh, no.
You see, I work in a store downtown.
Now, I never get a chance to get out.
I just sit around all day, and I never see anything.
So I said to myself, the first vacation I get, I'm going to see the Statue of Liberty.
This must be a big moment for you, huh?
Oh, it is.
And it means so much to us now.
Why, I was just reading here in this booklet.
Did you know this statue was given to us by the French?
Do you know what they had written on it?
Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses,
yearning to breathe free, "the wretched refuse of your teeming shore.
Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed to me."
And just look at the French. Isn't it sad?
Yeah. Very sad.
Oh, it's such a beautiful statue.
I could just sit up here all day thinking about it. Couldn't you?
Some other day, maybe. Not right now.
Right now I got to catch that boat back.
You coming?
Well, there's another boat in 15 minutes.
Couldn't we wait?
All the people have gone, and we'd be alone, just you and me.
Sounds cozy.
But I... I haven't got the time.
Oh, on a nice autumn day like this, you couldn't spare 15 minutes for me?
I don't like autumn.
You're not being very nice to a lonely girl.
You look as though you might be lonely, too.
Yeah.
I got to catch that boat.
Fifteen minutes shouldn't make such a big difference, Mr. Fry.
Who are you?
Come on. Quit stalling. Who are you?
I think I told you. A working girl on her day off.
Don't kid me!
What are you doing here?
It's rather a long story, Mr. Fry.
It all started with an unknown blonde, an aircraft worker at a factory in Glendale, California.
I get it.
Little Miss Liberty, carrying the torch.
Why'd you follow me?
Why do you think?
Take a look down there.
If you can't figure it out for yourself, they're coming for you.
Do you see him in this bunch?
No.
Barnes, you stay here and watch this end.
The rest of you fellows, come with me.
You two, watch that side.
I'm going up.
Pat, where is he?
He started down!
Are you sure?
He's up here! Come on!
Come on, Fry!
I'll get your sleeve.
Don't you go over. If you slip, that will be three gone.
Quick! Get a rope.
Can you get a grip with your feet?
I can't.
Kane, I'm getting a rope!
They're getting a rope. Hold on, Fry.
I'll clear you.
I swear I will.
I'll clear you.
Hurry up with the rope!
Tell them quick.
The sleeve.
Sleeve!
Kane!
A fond greeting to you
A warm handshake or two
Good friends always
A new thing is waiting to start
You must meet it Wake up and greet it
With a gay song in your heart
Here is an unusual expedition:
artists, musicians and writers setting out for a trip through Latin America to find new personalities, music and dances for their cartoon films.
So adiós Hollywood and saludos amigos.
Three days later they glided in to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil... then down to the Argentine, Buenos Aires... and out across the pampas.
At Cordoba, the party divided.
Some flew over the Andes into Chile.
The others went north to the Inca country;
Bolivia, Peru and Lake Titicaca... turning away from the modern cities to find the descendants of ancient Inca civilization.
Eight thousand square miles of water over two miles above sea level,
Lake Titicaca has been prominent in Inca history and folklore for generations.
Wood is scarce at this altitude, so the fishermen's boats are woven of balsa reeds.
There is always plenty of color and excitement here on market day.
These folks come from miles around to trade their goods and swap some of the local gossip.
The styles run to bright-colored clothes and conservative hats, and a rumble seat for the baby.
Just the kind of material the artists were after.
Their music is strange and exotic;
melodies handed down from their Inca ancestors.
And walking haystacks are right in tempo.
These little syncopated burros bear the heavy burdens here because the more dignified llama will carry us too much and no more.
When his quota is exceeded, that haughty aristocrat of the Andes calmly sits down and refuses to budge.
Yes, a llama can make you feel awfully unimportant.
All these impressions, together with the local color that had been absorbed, resulted in a little travelogue... seeing the land of the Incas through the eyes of a celebrated North American tourist.
Lake Titicaca is approximately 13,000 feet above sea level.
13,000 feet. Approximately.
At this great height, many visitors are subject to altitude fever or soroche.
Is that so?
The most common symptom is dizziness.
Often followed by palpitation of the heart.
The ears have a tendency to pop.
And a peculiar ringing sound is heard.
Fascinating, isn't it?
The balsa or basket boat is constructed entirely of reeds tightly bound together.
It's built to withstand the fury of the elements.
In fact, it seems to be impervious to practically everything... except the inquisitive tourist.
Crossing the lake is often filled with adventure.
A strong wind may arise very suddenly
and then stop suddenly.
In the village, we find this quaint old bakery, where the tourist may loaf around to his heart's content.
For the artist in search of local color, the marketplace presents an excellent picture of village life as shoppers and merchants bustle about the public square.
The precipitous terrain in this region offers no problem to these hearty folk.
And we find the people here divided into two classes;
those who walk against the wind and those who walk with the wind.
Yes, wherever the visitor points his camera, he finds a picture fit for framing.
The llama or "yama", is an odd-looking individual with considerable personality.
His master here exercises complete control over him with a home-made flute.
Let's see how he responds to a few notes up scale.
And down scale.
Up.
Down.
Now to a circular pattern.
Or reverse.
It's amazing.
Note how the crude sign language is being used by our tourist here is quickly interpreted by this wide-awake youngster.
The visitor never seems to be satisfied until he tries on the native costume.
The llama is obviously not a jitterbug... but if you want to explore this precipitous country, he'll solve all your transportation problems.
One soon becomes accustomed to the low, fleecy clouds that steal like silent ghosts across one's path.
The gentle undulating gait of the llama adapts itself very nicely to the swaying motion of the suspension bridge.
Suspension bridge?
Far below us, we see the village.
The flute.
Give me that flute, ya big palooka!
Hey!
The traveler should be cautioned against any reckless behavior at this high altitude.
Overexertion is dangerous.
And above all, one should never lose one's temper.
Shut up, ya big windbag!
Get off of me!
Go off!
Doggone you.
And finally, the pottery market... where the visitor always drops in... seldom failing to accumulate a large collection of the native handiwork, as he bids a fond farewell to the land of the Incas, Lake Titicaca.
The flight across the Andes into Chile over the highest mountains in America.
Plenty to see and remember on this spectacular trip.
Since no cameras are allowed here, the boys have to cover this from memory and sketches.
Impressions of Uspallata Pass from 16,000 feet.
These sketches and the stories told of the pioneer mail planes that first flew this route started everyone thinking.
First a little plane began to take shape with a personality all his own.
All agreed that he had good screen possibilities and before the plane set down at Santiago, his life story had begun.
Once upon a time in a little airport near Santiago, Chile, there lived three airplanes:
the papa plane, the mama plane and the baby plane.
The papa plane was a big, powerful male plane.
Mama plane was a middle-sized female plane.
And the baby plane was a little boy plane named Pedro.
Where is Pedro?
There he is.
Maybe someday... he'll grow up to be a big plane like his father who carries the mail between Chile and Argentina.
Like all fledglings, Pedro went to ground school to learn the ABC's of flying.
He studied reading, skywriting and arithmetic.
He was taught anatomy.
He also studied history...
Pedro!
And geography.
And in geography, he learned the mail route between Santiago and Mendoza.
Over the mighty Andes, past Aconcagua... highest mountain in the Western Hemisphere.
One day the papa plane was laid up with a cold in his cylinder head.
So he couldn't fly the mail.
And the mama plane couldn't stand the altitude because she had high oil pressure.
So she couldn't fly the mail.
But the mail must go through...
I hope.
Calling Pedro. Ready for Flight 2 to Mendoza.
Now, remember, Pedro", the mama plane said...
stay out of downdraft and keep your muffler on tight."
And don't go near Aconca. Aconca. Aconcagua!
Flight 2 leaving for Mendoza.
All clear, Pedro. Let her go.
Give her the gun, boy!
Gun her!
Gun her!
Don't lose you plane speed!
Look out!
And so, after a masterly takeoff,
Pedro started on his first assignment to pick up the mail at Mendoza.
Each and every trip through this pass is an adventure in itself.
At this altitude, you never can tell what...
Downdraft!
Pulled out of that one all right.
Handles himself like a veteran.
His course carried him over the Pass of Uspallata... where stands the statue of the Christ of the Andes... marking the boundary between Chile and Argentina.
So far, so good. Not a cylinder missing.
Pedro was flying on top of the world when suddenly... his first view of that towering monarch, Aconcagua!
So this was the big bully they'd warned him about.
But he didn't scare Pedro though.
Well, the worst is over.
And from now on, it's clear sailing to Mendoza.
Come in against the wind, Pedro.
There is your mail. Easy now. Attaboy!
He picked up his mail like a veteran.
That cargo is precious.
Pedro was homeward-bound and ahead of schedule.
I'll bet his mother and dad will be proud of him.
Maybe I shouldn't have mentioned it.
Look out!
Hope he got that out of his system.
Now with good luck and a...
I was afraid of that.
Hey, Pedro, come back! The little fellow had completely forgotten his responsibilities. Pedro!
Then suddenly... Aconcagua!
Its rocky, snow-filled crags formed the face of a leering monster.
The oil froze in little Pedro's cylinders... and his motor knocked with fright.
All those warnings came back to him now:
the treacherous crosscurrents, the sudden storms.
Climb above the storm, Pedro!
Never mind the mail!
Let it go!
Let it go! Forget the mail!
Climb, Pedro!
Look out!
Climb, Pedro!
Climb!
Get above the storm.
I know you can make it.
Drop the mail!
You've got to save yourself.
More altitude!
25,000 is all you need.
Up!
Up!
Gun your motor! Now just a little more and you'll be in the clear.
Climb, Pedro!
Climb! Good boy!
Good boy!
I knew you could make it.
You're all right now.
Just level off and head straight for home.
He is out of gas.
Pedro! Pedro!
He is gone.
Back at the home field...
Pedro's parents searched the skies in vain.
They knew that he couldn't have held out this long.
Their brave little son was gone... another martyr to the mail service.
Poor little fella. His first flight.
It's too bad it had to end this way.
What was that?
I wonder if it...
Wait!
It is!
Pedro!
Petey boy! Are you all right?
Well, don't ask me how he did it.
It wasn't exactly a three-point landing, but he did fulfill his mission.
He brought the mail through.
The mail, that all-important cargo.
Having wonderful time.
Wish you were... Well, it might have been important.
And he did bring in the mail.
And so, the papa plane, the mama plane and little Pedro flew happily ever after.
Sailing eastward from Chile, we cross the Argentine pampas... just millions of acres of rich grazing land... stretching from the mountains to Buenos Aires, the third largest city in the Western Hemisphere.
Buenos Aires is a beautiful city.
This is the plaza de Mayo, one of its delightful parks;
the Teatro Colon, home of the opera;
and the stately Congress building, center of Argentina's government.
The tallest building in South America... the Edificio Cavanaugh.
Yes, they were really impressed with the big city, but impressive too, was the lure of the pampas, and the Argentine gaucho as painted by F. Molina Campos.
The party were guests at his ranch studio where Senor Campos paints the gaucho with amazing detail and humor.
Seeing these pictures made them more anxious than ever to meet these caballeros in person.
And they lived up to their pictures.
A real Wild West show... but just part of the day's work for a gaucho.
Sketching these paisanos in action was no easy job.
But they did manage to get a good look at the gaucho's equipment.
Silver coins decorate his belt, or tirador.
The sheepskin saddle.
Soft horsehide boots.
This garment is called a chiripa.
Here the visitors were treated to an asado.
choice cuts of meat; mate, the Argentine tea;
and wine from their own vineyards.
True Argentine hospitality.
A group of skilled dancers entertained the guests.
Not the modern tango of Buenos Aires... but the country dances of the Argentine.
The same tunes to which their grandparents had danced.
Notice how closely these steps resemble the old-time square dances of North America.
Gathering picture material here was a pleasure.
Another story was under way.
And after seeing Senor Campos' paintings and all this colorful exhibition, we couldn't help but compare the life of the Argentine gaucho with that of our own cowboy.
And they reached way back into Texas to find a leading man.
From the windswept plains of Montana to the sunbaked banks of the Rio Grande over countless miles of mountain and prairie untouched and unsullied by the mercenary hand of civilization... roams a tough, hardy and heroic breed of man:
the North American cowboy.
Strong, silent and weather-beaten.
Howdy, strangers.
This colorful cowhand of the great West has his counterpart in the South American gaucho.
So let's call upon the magic of our motion picture camera and whisk our hardy heros outward.
Over land and sea, over rugged mountains and dense jungles... down across the equator to the lush, grassy pampas of the Argentine, the home of the gaucho.
Now, the cowboys of both Americas have much in common... although their costume differs in a few minor details.
We substitute bombachas for chaps; the sombrero.
Then there is the saco, the tirador... the chiripa and the panuelo.
Then, finally, we have the poncho... which just about covers everything.
The gaucho's closest friend and inseparable companion is his horse or pingo.
Quickly the gaucho reaches for his lasso.
Twirling the rawhide above his head, he deftly tosses the noose about the horse's neck and easily subdues the spirited animal with the help of the snubbing post... or palenque.
Thanks to the palenque, or snubbing post, the horse is soon brought under control and is ready for the saddle.
While it appears complex at first glance... the recado or saddle is really simplicity itself.
In saddling the horse or pingo, the gaucho simply lays a foundation of sudaderos and rosaderos, adding the cinchas, bastos, sheepskin, pigskin... bridle, bit and, finally... the gaucho.
When riding the range at night, the saddle may be quickly converted into a bed or catre.
Bed?
One of the gaucho's favorite sports is the asado... or Argentine barbecue.
Over an open charcoal fire... thick, juicy, tender steaks are prepared.
And amigos, it fairly melts in your mouth.
What a noodle!
The gaucho's method of eating looks quite simple, yet requires a certain amount of practice.
The bread and meat are held in one hand, the knife in the other.
Note the action of wrist and elbow as knife and food synchronize in deft, graceful rhythm.
One, two, bite, cut, chew.
One, a-two, a-bite, cut, chew.
Yes, it is this wholesome diet that builds the gaucho's nerves of steel and muscles of iron.
And now the boleadoras or bolas.
The bolas consists of three lead weights covered with rawhide and is often used for sport, such as capturing that swift-moving bird of the pampas, the Argentine ostrich or avestruz..
Unlike most members of the ostrich family, the avestruz is not equipped with ornamental tail plumage.
Its slender legs make excellent targets for the bolas.
Did he say bolas?
Dashing at breakneck speed, the gaucho whirls the bolas, round and round... faster and faster, and then the throw!
Straight and sure it flies, until it finds its mark.
And the swift bird is captured and tied all in one operation.
And now to fully appreciate this remarkable feat, let us study the action through the eye of the slow-motion camera.
Note the grace and beauty of this light-footed creature in startled flight.
With delicate balance and clocklike precision of timing, man and beast moving as one display a minimum of waste motion... as the whirling bolas are unleashed.
Faster and faster!
On and on they spin, closer and closer!
Here they come!
Be careful!
Get out of the way!
Heads up!
Watch it!
Look out, look out!
Here it comes!
Duck, duck!
Too late!
Too late!
And when night...
When night falls... the lone gaucho oft-times finds himself far, far out on the pampas.
Listen to the melancholy strains of the triste, a sad, romantic ballad.
But the gaucho is not always sad.
Come, let us dance to the lively beat of the chacarera, the dance of the farmer's daughter.
Combining the minuet, the bunny hug and a dash of jumping jive.
The pampas version of cutting a rug.
And El Malambo... a solo number in which the dancer swings out with utter abandon, often described as perpetual motion below the equator.
Traditional dance of the rooster and the hen.
And now, as he sways to the gentle undulations of El Malambo... we gently waft our transplanted cowboy
back to his prairie homeland.
Here we leave him with warm and tender memories of his visit to the gay, romantic land of the gaucho.
And now from the pampas to Brazil and Rio de Janeiro, a city of amazing beauty and a perfect setting.
One of the best views of the city is from the top of Sugarloaf... overlooking Copacabana Beach, the playground of Rio.
From Corcovado, the Statue of the Saviour looks out upon these scenes of active city life.
This is the kind of atmosphere the artists were after:
the outdoor cafes... the mosaic sidewalks that are found all over Rio.
These designs are a tribute to patience and artistry... preserving a Brazilian tradition.
Here are some of the first impressions.
This is what can happen to a big city when a crowd of cartoonists are turned loose.
Among the sketches was a promising actor,
Old Papagaio, the parrot featured in most of Brazil's funny stories.
With the help of the wardrobe department, he becomes Joe Carioca.
The music of Brazil, a samba.
Rhythm instruments like the reco reco... and the cabaca... all help to beat out that intricate samba rhythm... a lively two-step with a bounce.
It's the same rhythm that captivates the whole city when carnival time comes around.
Carnival in Rio... three hilarious days and nights.
Singing, dancing and celebrating.
The spirit of the Mardi Gras and New Year's Eve rolled into one.
Each year hundreds of songs are written especially for this occasion, and the dream of every composer is to have his song chosen as a carnival hit.
One number stood out as a perfect background for the first Brazilian film.
Its author, Ary Barroso, has made use of the samba rhythm to paint a musical picture of his native land.
A watercolor of Brazil.
What happened?
Where am I?
What's going on around here?
Boy, this is fun.
What's this?
A parrot?
My card?
I know I brought one from the States.
There you are.
Donald Duck"?
Or, as you Americans say...
let's go see the town."
Okay, Joe!
Where do we go?
Donald, I will show you the land of the samba.
Samba?
What's samba?
Donald, now you have the spirit of the samba!
Oh, boy! Oh, boy!
Samba!
I need gas!
Signor Bragana, I need gas!
My truck engine is broken and nobody wants to stop and take a look.
Everyone's in a hurry to drive on.
I wake up in the morning and here we are.
They give me no peace, even when I've gone to bed.
And this one?
Who is he?
Hey, you, get down!
That's an uncomfortable way to travel.
I should carry a mattress for tramps.
Let's go.
Hurry up. Watch them, they'll steal a whole hen-house.
What do you want?
Fill it up.
Hey, Bragana.
No, not here yet.
Stay! Sit!
Do you serve food here?
I'm asking if you serve food here.
Look, I can pay.
All right, but you eat in the other room.
Wait, I'll bring it to you.
It's good.
Do you know the fat man?
He's my husband.
He's lucky to have such a wife,
...one that cooks so well.
Save your breath.
Anyway, I'm not a cook.
Wait for me there.
It's hot in here by the stove.
You have fine shoulders.
What's a little heat to you?
Giovanna, keep an eye on the chickens.
We've caught a chicken thief hiding on a truck.
He must still be around here.
You never know what those guys are up to.
Why don't you eat?
He may try something.
You hear so many things these days.
Here it's even in the paper.
Mops...
Just the one I was looking for.
Who gave you permission to let him in here?
Are you crazy?
He could even steal the dishes.
Get going-
My name's Bragana, I know your sort.
You think you're a lady, painting your nails all day and let my house go.
Don't get mad at me.
You're really smart.
You talk and talk and let him go without paying.
Without paying?
Yes.
Without paying. - Why didn't you say so before?
I'll fix him.
Hey! You! Wait a minute!
You can't fool Bragana.
You can't eat without paying.
What are you saying?
Don't play dumb.
My wife says you didn't pay.
Your wife told you that?
That's a good one.
Empty your pockets.
So?
I'm broke.
I'm no fool, you must settle up somehow.
Take my trousers.
What would I do with it?
Well, then...
we'll find something else.
What do you want to find?
You said your truck engine is broken.
So, what's that to you?
I'm a mechanic.
So? So, let's go take a look.
You think you can cheat me? If so, you'll pay for it.
It's written on your face that you're a good man.
What were you doing on that truck?
I'm unemployed.
You're not a tramp?
I like travelling.
Trains cost money.
I get by.
You get by?
These hens!
Always here, pecking at the tyres.
You also like working in the dark, don't you? Come on.
Let's see what you can do.
We need to run it to hear how it sounds.
Did the distributor drop out on the road?
You need a spare.
What is the nearest town?
Codigoro.
I could go and get it.
I'll phone.
It's one hour away by bicycle.
Meanwhile, you could mend the water pump outside.
You know, it's hard getting a mechanic just for that. - Since you're already here...
It'll take me half a day.
Yes?
Then take the tools and let's go.
You were a bersagliere?
Sure.
In the Sixth Regiment.
Me, too. I spent 18 months as bersagliere.
You too?
What a coincidence.
The great Sixth Regiment.
Actually, Laregola the Marshal used to say the Fourth was the best.
You mean Sergeant Laregola? You met him too?
Study war tactics and you'll reap the reward".
Hello, Father Remigio.
Good morning, Bragana.
Do you want to arm wrestle again?
No, another time.
I've just seen a lot of ducks;
I'd like to shoot half a dozen.
Giovanna, I'm going to Codigoro.
Yes. Something urgent.
Hello...
Codigoro garage?
I need a distributor for my truck.
Could you sent it right away?
To Bragana at the Dogana.
Still hungry?
Then it's impossible for tonight.
Can't you find someone to bring it?
Yes, but this time I can't pay.
I understand.
Ferruccio, can you bring me a spare for my truck?
I'm sorry, I can't.
Why not cycle with me?
Good idea.
I'll get ready.
Giovanna, my hat and coat.
It was good of you to drop by.
I've something special to tell you on the way.
I'll be back in an hour.
Bring me the bicycle.
What about him?
He's the mechanic, mending the truck.
Mechanic?
Yes, what's funny about that?
He sized up everything at a glance.
Do as you please.
It's my house. I'm the boss.
Understand?
Good bye. - Let's go, Father. - Where are you from?
Senigallia.
Senigallia!
Half saints, half rascals".
In the meantime, work at that pump. I'll expect you to be done.
Don't worry.
Let's go, Father.
♪ Love is beautiful with you. ♪
♪ It makes me dream, it makes me sing. ♪ ♪ Who knows why?
♪ ♪ It's love that makes our hearts beat fast. ♪
♪ It comes like the breeze for a moment and then it goes. ♪
♪ But when you're with me, ♪ ♪ I'm happy because... ♪
♪ love is beautiful with you. ♪
Let's find him now.
There are some good places in the marshes.
What about the spare for the truck?
I'll pick it up on the way back.
First I want to find out.
Here comes the ferry!
Really 5 kilo?
I can guess where they caught it.
When did you realize I liked you?
Right away.
When I asked for food... and you didn't answer.
Now you'll never leave me, will you?
Not even to go back on the road?
No.
Perhaps I was wrong about you.
You'll go boasting to everybody.
I keep some things to myself.
You're the first woman I've met for a long time.
These past few months,
I've been a docker in Trieste, a mechanic sometimes...
Who could I tell around here?
Then we'll get along.
Why hasn't he come back?
He always says he'll be back soon.
He's with the priest.
How did you come to marry that old man?
I don't know.
I was out of work when I met him, with his gold watch-chain.
I was down to asking men to buy me a meal.
Do you know what it is to be penniless?
Not knowing where to go.
And then...?
Do you know... what it means when men buy you a meal?
I thought I could be safe with him... but this is even worse. - Yes, I know.
It's impossible to live with him;
so dirty, so false.
What do I care about his money, if I have to work in the kitchen?
Do I look like a cook?
You deserve to be a lady.
You understand me.
With you I don't need to lie.
You are young.
Each time he touches me with those hands...
I would like to scream.
I'm not a lady.
I'm just an unlucky woman.
I can't stand it anymore.
Suppose we go away...
you and me together...
Where?
Who cares where? Wherever we want.
No.
For me it would mean going back to the old life.
For you it's different, but for me...
Unless I had a place to live.
No.
I'll stay here.
I'll put up with it.
Until...
Until?
Until I don't know when.
Tell me, could you love me for ever?
Yes, Giovanna, I think so.
Enough...
not to want anything else?
Yes, Giovanna.
Then something must happen for us.
But you must love me very much, Gino.
Gino.
Hey, Gino.
That was a long time.
Here's the spare.
Did you fix the pump?
Yes. It works.
Now you can fix it?
Here, it's done.
It runs real well!
You did a good job!
Now, where are you going?
Signor Bragana...
What is it?
I did the job, now we're even.
But now I would like to ask for something.
If there's some more work for me here...
If you could put me up for a few more days.
Tired of tramping?
I won't give you any trouble.
I don't really need anyone but we were both bersaglieri.
I'll feed you and you'll do odd jobs.
All right?
Okay.
Now I'll lend you my razor, you need it.
Giovanna?
Here you are.
Why didn't you answer?
Give me a kiss.
Can't you see someone's looking?
Don't act like this in front of strangers.
He's not a child, he knows what goes on between a man and his wife.
And he's not a stranger.
It's Gino. Didn't I tell you?
Gino's going to spend a few days with us.
With us?
Yes, with us.
A mechanic like him shouldn't be tramping the roads.
Here, Gino.
Go shave yourself.
Come, help me dry out.
There will be a storm, it's so sultry.
It would be good if it rained.
Did you get the chickens inside?
How hot it is.
Harder, much harder.
Good.
See Gino?
These are the pleasures of being married.
Yes, one should get married.
You left it late.
A little late. But I don't regret it.
You only think of yourself as if I didn't exist.
Don't worry.
I've not forgotten you.
I have a piece of paper in here.
When the time comes, you'll appreciate it. That's all.
I know what I'm doing.
A piece of paper?
Who knows what kind of mess you've gotten into.
A "mess", she calls it.
What's the saying?
The wise person makes the relatives happy".
Meanwhile, let's make sure everything is ready.
I'm going fishing early tomorrow.
I'd rather stay here, I hate fishing.
Please yourself.
I can't stand those cats.
They sense the storm, it will break soon.
I hope so, it's stifling here.
Why don't you take off your blouse?
Because he's here?
Where is he?
I don't know.
You're still mad at him?
It's just the heat.
The heat.
Here I am.
What are you doing?
It's going to rain.
What have you done here?
There's a ton of pepper in it.
Just what we need with this heat.
You did it on purpose, didn't you?
Idiot!
You're lucky we're not alone.
Here!
I'm coming!
Look, if I give you this, will you keep it?
We can't stay three together.
You don't have to tell me.
Listen Giovanna, come away with me.
It was a truck from Rovigo.
The driver was telling me they killed poor Saffi.
They say it was one of his workers.
Because of his wife.
Did they catch him?
No, but they'll get him.
How was he killed?
The body was found shot in the back.
Sometimes you lose control.
Those damned cats!
We must close the shutters... or the wind will smash them.
Can't you hear them?
All right, I'll deal with the cats.
Gino.
Wait a moment.
Wait.
I can't go any further.
I can't continue.
You're tired.
We'll wait for a truck that can take us to the train station.
I'm not tired, but I can't go on.
You agreed last night.
It's too late to go back.
Why too late?
He is fishing, he didn't notice anything.
You're out of your mind.
We must get to the station.
And then?
We'll catch a train.
No.
It's impossible. It won't work.
I wasn't made to tramp about like you.
We'll sleep in a hotel and tomorrow we'll look for work.
You said that anything was better than living with him.
I made a mistake.
Giovanna...
Come back with me, Gino.
And have him always between us?
Come back with me, Gino.
Gino, think about it.
Tickets!
Your tickets, please.
Tickets please, gentlemen.
I haven't a ticket.
Where are you going?
I haven't a ticket...
or any money.
What do you mean?
I don't have a ticket or money to buy one with.
I'll get off at the next station, if you like.
Don't worry, at the next station I'll get you off this train.
What's this? Pushing a gentleman off a train?
Mind your own business.
Stop acting important.
How much is it?
I'll pay for his ticket.
To Ancona, more than 100 lire, including the fine.
So?
Can't I be twisted out of 100 lire to help a friend?
Please yourself.
It's 120, plus 50.
I don't get paid to make distinctions.
Forget it.
We have to help each other.
How far is Ancona?
Another four or five stops.
Ancona has a Harbour, doesn't it?
I don't know.
I'll look around.
And you? What will you do there?
I'm an artist.
Here today, gone tomorrow.
I always find work.
I'm coming from Trieste.
I'm called "Lo Spagnolo"
because I worked in Spain a long time.
I you want you can stick with me.
Two are better than one.
Why not?
What now?
Find a place to sleep.
We'll look for work tomorrow.
Heads.
We'll go left, near the Harbour.
The room usually costs eight.
With two of you it will be twelve.
We'll pay tomorrow morning.
Tomorrow? No way.
Pay now or no room.
Let's not worry about this.
You look honest, but him...
Here's your money.
You see Gino, money has legs and should always be on the move otherwise in your pockets it gets moldy.
Instead, you get a bite, then pass it on to someone else.
Money made in Rome helps people in Torino, Palermo...
Don't wear shoes in bed.
Only the dead do that.
Don't worry, we aren't going to ruin your sheets.
ORGY -.
Are you hungry?
I don't feel hungry when I travel and then,
these last few days I've been eating regularly.
Selling women's clothes?
Hands off!
Keep out of my business.
Your face has changed.
I didn't know you were so involved.
You're making too much noise about this.
I'm not.
Why did you want to hit me?
You're right.
I'm sorry.
Never before...
have I met such a woman.
If you stay with me, I'll teach you that streets aren't
only for girl-chasing.
That would be useless.
I understand you, you have so many ideas, but your thoughts are beyond me, things I can't understand.
You say "we need to help each other", you pay the train fare for someone without any money.
I know one thing only...
I'll never be happy without her.
Why didn't you bring her with you?
She didn't want to come.
That means she doesn't love you.
Yes, she did... but she's not like us.
What do you mean?
She's brave enough to do some things, but not to leave her house and her husband.
She fears poverty.
You must go away.
As far as you can.
Go away?
First I need to forget her.
Now I know I want her...
no matter what it costs.
If I went back I could never resist her... just as before.
Listen to me.
Get away to sea.
The sea breeze will clear your mind of these ideas.
You'll feel free again.
Free?
Free.
An umbrella turned around like this, jumps up and down, flies like a plane.
50 cents, and I'll tell your future.
Green. The color of strength, the color of hope.
50 cents.
Only 50 cents.
Excuse me.
Watch closely, this is the water test.
There is no trickery, just hold this, sir.
It's better than any you can buy in a shop.
Tip the water in, sir.
You see?
My umbrella lets not a drop of water through.
The handle is genuine horn, the ribs are made of steel, and it's yours, not for 50 or even 40, but only 20 lire!
I'll be dammed!
Excuse me.
Look who's here!
Where have you been hiding?
Why didn't you say you weren't happy with us?
What are you up to?
You know, the truck broke down again.
I had to take it apart and call a mechanic from Ferrara. If you had been there...
Tell him, Giovanna, all the trouble I had.
How are you, signora Bragana?
A fine job you've found in town.
It's tied at the back.
It's well tied, crossed double.
I'll help you get it off.
It's almost as if you'd got it on for life.
You had a job, food and a bed with us;
now you're a sandwich-man.
Wait a minute. I'll take care of it by myself.
Even the old proverbs says so...
Please, look after this for me, I want to talk to a friend.
A friend?
Yes, a friend.
There's no point in saying anything now.
Hey, wait a minute.
Take this.
Fifty cents! It's no trick!
It's the hand of fate.
How's the business?
We've closed for two days.
For Giovanna's sake, too; she was getting sick.
Here we are. "Amici's Bar".
This is where I will sing.
The Best Voice Contest.
I'll win.
Where are you going?
I'm a contestant.
Hurry up, you're late.
I'm Giuseppe Bragana.
I'm singing a piece from "La Traviata".
You didn't get far.
If I scared you so much... why did you stop halfway?
Let's not talk about it.
Tell me, did you think about me sometimes?
What difference would it make?
Giovanna...
I tried to forget you, but I couldn't.
I can't live without you.
Before, the world seemed a big place.
Now, there is only your store.
You've been in my mind... since you sent me away, alone.
I never knew people could depend on each other so.
If that's what's bothering you, you'll soon be free again.
I'll go back home with him.
You'll soon forget about me.
Giovanna!
You must come with me.
You know that's impossible.
Then I'll come back to the store.
Is that what you want?
Have you seen Gino?
No, I haven't see him.
Hey Peppone, have you seen Gino?
He's probably gone with some girl.
I sang well, didn't I?
Be careful, you'll get sick, you're sweating.
We must celebrate your victory. We too are from Ferrara.
Yes, but I'm with my wife and friend.
Have a drink with us too. The champagne is very good.
Okay, let's go, let's go.
Cheers!
Gino's always game for free food and drink.
Remember when he first came and tried to diddle us?
Everyone invited us to have a drink, but who paid in the end?
Me, Bragana.
Sooner or later they'll come to the store and I'll get my money back.
Work is what matters and knowing how to earn money, and having someone to leave it to.
Am I right?
Well, when do we make this son?
We mustn't waste any more time. Tell her, Gino.
But women are frightened of losing their figure.
It would be too bad to lose a voice like mine.
Let's go.
Know what I think?
I bet you can't guess.
Beniamino.
We'll name him after Gigli, then he'll be famous, too.
That's a good one, isn't it?
Tonin. Hurry up.
We have a long way to go.
Now!
You understand?
Now!
Be careful.
What are you doing? - Don't worry. I have a good grip.
Why not let him drive?
Why?
Get out, get some air.
Get behind the wheel.
Are we close to the river?
I feel better now.
What's this?
Let him drive. You rest.
Let's go.
Signor Bragana had drunk too much.
He got sick.
You should have been driving.
You're a mechanic, aren't you?
Yes, but he said I didn't know the road.
You'd been drinking, too?
We were all together, but he drank the most.
All right, go on.
He stopped for a breather.
He got back behind the wheel, then he drove for about a kilometre.
Why did you leave the main road to get on the country road?
He wanted to take a short cut:
he knew the area so well... maybe not so well and missed the curve.
Suddenly I felt us beginning to skid.
The next moment it was all over.
When I came to, I saw blood everywhere.
How was it your boss was killed instantly?
Maybe he was pinned between the steering wheel and the car.
The impact crushed his head.
Why do you think his wife was unhurt?
I told you already, I had no time to look.
She was sitting on the offside.
Maybe she jumped.
She jumped with her purse and hat?
Purse and hat?
What do you mean?
A truck driver said she had them when she asked for help.
She didn't look as if she'd been in a accident.
I found them on the ground afterwards.
I took them to clean off the blood.
So you jumped from the car before it rolled over?
Yes, I was sure it would happen.
I held the door handle.
I asked my husband to let him drive, but he didn't want him to.
And he was going faster than usual.
What did you do immediately afterwards?
I came back to the truck.
I opened the door... and my husband wasn't breathing.
Then he came out.
Didn't he faint?
Yes, that's why I ran to stop the first vehicle.
He was getting up when we got back.
Have you been with Bragana for a long time?
Once, for a few days.
I didn't fancy staying too long, so I left.
We met again in Ancona, he insisted I came back.
You're a drifter, but you decided to settle down?
Yes, just like that.
Nothing to add?
No.
Let's go sign the report.
Inspector, "Accidental Death"?
Accidental?
Let's write it that way.
Come along, please.
This is everything he had on him.
This is the permit to take the body... from the morgue.
Thank you.
Goodbye, signora Bragana.
We may need further information before closing the investigation.
We'll let you know.
It's hot.
Do you want a drink?
What is it?
Aren't you pleased to be back?
I imagined the return so differently.
We must get used to it.
When we open again and people come... everything will be easier.
We're reopening the store?
Of course.
What are you thinking?
Nothing.
|'m happy-
I can hardly believe it...
I can be here alone with you.
Gino, isn't it what we wanted?
Yes, it's what we wanted.
When I think of all the days spent behind this counter... crying... alone.
I don't want that again.
Who's talking about going back?
What's done is done.
We must love each other very much, Gino.
Otherwise... it was all for nothing.
Listen Giovanna, we must leave this place.
Why?
Because, as long as we stay here,
I'll always see him.
I won't be able to forget him.
I see him behind the bar.
I still hear his voice.
Giovanna, let's sell the store and get away from here!
Away from here.
You're being ridiculous, shouting out like that in the store.
They'll hear you.
Don't drink so much.
Someone's out there.
Let them go.
We can't. They saw us arrive.
You'll have to serve.
No, look how I'm dressed.
I'll go upstairs.
You know what to do.
The drinks are all there.
Open the windows.
Are you closed?
No.
What do you want?
I knocked, but didn't see anybody.
I'd like something to drink.
It's tough working with only one arm.
Are you the owner?
There's a manageress.
I'm sorry.
Sometimes I feel like chatting.
I'm a stranger here. I don't know anyone here.
I've come to work.
How much?
One lira.
Is that all?
It's two and a half in Ferrara.
Give as you please.
You must be new to the job, it's a good thing I'm honest.
Who was it?
Someone asking questions, a workman.
Why don't people mind their own business?
I don't like nosey people.
Why are you so frightened, even of the first customer?
What were you doing there?
Nothing.
Let me see!
What do you care?
I want to see!
Give it to me, Giovanna.
Bragana wouldn't have spent so much money on a servant.
Of course, he wants to be comfortable.
Say what you like, they don't look happy.
You know what?
I'd like to tell them what really happened, to put an end to it once and for all.
Are you so scared of marrying me?
You've stopped loving me, it seems.
It's only a month since we met in Ancona, you said you couldn't live without me.
That's true, but... each day I hate this house more.
We'll be broke if we leave here now.
Nobody would ever forgive us.
We must stay.
Do you understand?
I know...
You've always feared uncertainty.
I thought we could sell this place.
Then we could truly start all over.
We'll see about it later, not now, I told you.
We can't leave just like that.
But I can't handle it.
I can't get used to using his plates, sleeping in his bed.
That's nonsense.
We mustn't be afraid to face people.
That's why you want the band, to attract people from Ferrara.
Be reasonable. Business must go on.
Carry on, then, if you like it so much.
You've done many jobs;
you could learn this trade.
It's no job to be the keeper... of a dead man's house.
Signora Giovanna?
I'm coming.
Signora Giovanna?
Signora Giovanna?
I'm coming.
Good morning.
What can I get you?
How did you find me?
It wasn't difficult.
Everyone talks about you.
No. Let's go this way.
What have you done with the budgerigars?
I didn't bring them.
You want to try your luck again?
What do you need with them?
You've made your choice.
You've settled down nicely.
You've given up travelling.
You can't go on for ever;
you'll settle down one day.
You know that my sort never settle down.
Why talk like that?
You've been a coward.
By loving a woman?
Not that.
What, then?
I'm going away now.
It's a good season.
I thought you might come with me.
You'd come if you were the old Gino.
I wanted to go to Sicily.
Sicily is a lovely place.
Everywhere is beautiful: Naples, Genoa...
Have you been to Genoa?
I don't like moving any more.
What's become of you?
I don't like travelling any more!
Stop preaching at me, just because I don't want to tramp any more.
Tramp?
Why say it like that?
I should have known you're not one of us now;
one pays for one's actions.
Shut up.
I'll shut up.
I won't split on you, don't worry.
Shut up.
Stay with that woman you won so nicely.
Shut up!
Once you only threatened me.
You're braver now.
Can I help you?
But you hurt yourself.
You're too quick with your hands.
It's our business.
I'll come with you.
No, I'll go alone.
I don't need anyone.
Spagnolo...
Spagnolo?
Spagnolo!
I'd said that someone who flares up like that could be dangerous.
Signora Giovanna!
I'm coming.
Hello?
How do you do?
Signor Giuseppe, they call you "Lo Spagnolo"?
Yes, Sir.
Let's go in.
We made 780 lire today.
The band was a good idea.
Why don't they leave us alone?
It's as if they all knew the truth.
What are you saying?
This time last year I was up in the mountains.
I worked in the mines.
You talk as if I'm not here.
Won't you eat something?
I'm not hungry.
What are you doing? Give me my ball of wood.
Thanks.
Are the kids bothering you?
I like them.
Would you like an ice, too?
Another one.
Just right for this weather.
Why are you smiling?
No reason, I just feel happy.
Then you've got no worries.
Maybe because I've met you.
Or because of the ice-cream.
You're a bit of a flirt.
It depends who I'm with.
So you like me?
Why do you want to know?
Do you live here?
No, I'm leaving soon.
You're not from Ferrara?
No.
Then you'll be going back home?
I can't go home.
Where are you going?
Now I'm going to the theatre.
I'm a dancer. Next we'll go to Como.
You can see me in the chorus, second from left, at "Cinema Teatro Verdi".
You're a nice girl.
I'm glad I met you.
Will you walk with me?
I'm waiting for someone.
Thanks for the ice, you're kind.
There aren't many like me.
Do you like her?
Those girls live in Via Saraceno, number 15.
She's not the prettiest.
Gino?
Gino.
Know what's happened?
Bragana had a life insurance policy.
They'll pay me, but they asked lots of questions, worse than the police.
But it's all right.
I get 50,000 lire.
We can expand the business.
A life insurance policy?
You'd only get it if he died.
Of course, that's the idea of life insurance.
A nice arrangement.
But it's your money, too.
You think I want it?
I don't want to look at it.
Why didn't you tell me?
I didn't know about it before.
I got their letter.
Don't be a hypocrite.
I was a fool not to guess.
Now I understand it all.
Now I know why you wouldn't leave:
because of this money.
You're unreasonable.
Unreasonable?
You simply used me, because you needed a helper.
It would have been easy to have found someone braver.
It doesn't take much.
I'm sick of it!
I can't bear the sight of you.
Watch your tongue.
Are you going to blackmail me now?
I'll show you I can go.
Gino!
Enjoy the money with someone else.
Does the girl Anita live here?
Yes, but she's out.
You can wait in her room.
Thank you.
First you say yes, then no.
What do I do now?
Go back to Rosina.
I never thought you'd come.
I was passing, so I came up.
You like me, then?
I'm glad you came.
You're so different from the other men.
I don't know why, but you appeal to me.
Then... what did you come for?
I'm going to eat.
Do you want some?
Are you hungry?
Let's eat together.
I'll buy something.
Wait.
I'll come with you.
Where are you going?
Now I know why the insurance upset
your delicate heart.
Come.
Think I'd let you go... After all I've done for you?
For me?
Yes.
We did what we did because we love each other.
Shut up!
She doesn't know me.
Are you squeamish?
Gino!
Stop all that talk.
Listen to me...
forget what I said.
I've been unfair, but I'm desperate.
You loved me.
You haven't finished with me.
Come back with me.
You'll calm down.
Don't treat me so badly.
No.
Leave me alone.
Watch out, Gino!
Why should I?
You know.
One word from me and they'll arrest you.
Choose: come with me, or...
Or... what?
I'm sorry about what happened.
I've eaten.
You can help yourself.
Shall I tell you?
I'm not inquisitive.
Why have you changed?
What do you care?
You realize that you should have come to us before?
Yes, but we have to work, we're always on the road.
Now you called us and we came.
We told you all we knew.
You'll swear you saw them both climbing up the bank... as the truck was rolling down?
I'll swear to it, inspector. I remarked on it to my mate.
We were the first to help but we had to go.
Other people came and we left, we couldn't do much more.
Yes, they already told me they were in a hurry because they had to be in Milan before noon.
All right.
Sign the statement.
What about the man, Costa?
Don't worry, I've got my eye on him.
He's in town today but he has a two-way ticket.
Arrest him before he leaves.
I want to question him.
Sure, I'll take care of it.
There was this noise in my ears...
He was trying to get up again.
Then I saw him fall back.
She looked at me, looked at me.
Then I acted.
I didn't really know what I was doing.
She had been so unhappy.
Tell me...
do you despise me now?
No, you are the same for me.
I'll never be my old self.
From now on I'm tied to her.
I'm a police officer.
Coffe.
Now I know why that man has been following me for a month.
It's the police.
She's reported me.
I've got to get out of here.
What can you do?
Think carefully.
You'll be lost if you go back to her.
You can help me.
Go downstairs.
There's a man down there.
Come, I'll show you.
Can you see him?
Would you be able to recognize him?
Yes.
Keep him until I escape.
Tell him... you saw him looking up here.
Say I left an hour ago.
Yes, tell him that.
He was here but left an hour ago."
He might not believe me.
What else can you say?
I'll say I'm angry with you...
because you didn't pay me.
I'll go now.
Giovanna, open the door.
Open up.
Giovanna, open up!
Here I am.
Kill me, if you like.
You kept your threat.
I don't care now.
I know what you're capable of.
I'm not afraid.
Not afraid?
I don't care about anything.
You're not afraid?
Then why did you report me?
It was only a threat... to try to keep you.
Go, if you like.
I'm not afraid of loneliness now.
Me, or another man...
it's all the same to you.
No, Gino.
Don't you understand?
Stop lying.
You're glad you reported me.
They'll catch me and you'll have your revenge, isn't that so?
I didn't report you.
I wanted to when
I saw you with that girl, that's all.
I got over it.
I should've known that sooner or later you'd go.
These last few days I was afraid you'd go.
I know you can't stay in one place.
I remember... the day you came here for the first time.
You didn't even have socks.
I know why I loved you so much right away... and why I hated him so much.
I can't hurt you, even if I wanted to, even if you left me because I'm going to have your child, Gino.
What did you say?
Yes. I suspected.
Now I'm sure.
I had to talk to you about it.
Everything was mixed up before... but now it's clear.
I've thought a lot about it, about us, the baby.
You see, we stole one life... but we're giving one back.
That's why I'm not afraid.
I'm not bitter towards you.
I know I love you, Gino... and I'll never hurt you.
But how can you overcome the temptation to vent your hate on me?
If you want to, do it now.
I've told you everything.
Here I am.
Do you think I'm wicked?
No.
Gino!
I looked for you all night.
You're all wet.
Did you run?
Yes, but it doesn't matter.
Forgive me, Giovanna.
It would have been terrible if I'd hurt you.
This night has set me free, as if I've become someone else.
Before, something was keeping me away from you.
I had no peace.
Now I'm sure I love you.
But we have to leave... for ever, immediately.
Yes, we'll go.
We couldn't help going wrong with all we've been through.
From now on, don't listen to me.
You were right.
Don't say anything more.
Didn't I say everything has changed now?
Gino?
Gino.
Last night, why did you say I had reported you?
I don't know.
That man...
What man?
They were at the station...
they must still be after me!
Giovanna?
Put your head on my shoulder.
Comfortable?
Yes, I'm fine.
You don't know what it's like, with a baby inside you.
Soon I'll be getting fatter.
I don't care if I look ugly.
Just the opposite.
I want everybody to see.
This is life, Gino.
Yes, this is life at last.
Away from that house.
Maybe they've already got there, at this moment. They'll search every room.
If they catch us?
You couldn't be with me any more, Gino.
Don't worry about it.
You'll see. Everything will be all right.
Good luck will be with us.
It won't fail people who expect a child.
Don't worry.
From now on, I'll deal with everything.
Where are they?
To Scatovari.
Scatovari?
Did they take the car?
Let's go.
Let's not waste any time.
We must be patient behind this truck.
Try to pass, the fumes are making me sick.
Close the window.
You know, from now on you must take special care of me.
I've heard of women that had problems because they exerted themselves.
But nothing will happen to me, will it?
Or else why is it so nice to feel my breasts getting bigger?
Right, Gino?
Bring the car.
Gino Costa?
Let's go.
Roberto!
You promised.
Adios, Kashkin. - Adios, Roberto.
Hola, Americano.
Hola.
Hola.
Help yourself, Jordan.
General Golz?
What an accent!
He even knows me in the dark!
That's all we have in Spain now ... accents.
Eh, Jordan?
I was looking for you.
I saw you. How did it go with the train?
Alright.
And Kashkin?
He caught one.
He didn't want to be taken alive.
so it was like that?
Yes. Murder.
Orders are orders.
I still say it was a murder.
Well ... in this business, Jordan, remember nothing.
Nothing except the next job.
What's next? - A bridge.
Oh, a bridge.
Right.
To blow the bridge is nothing.
But to blow it at the time of the attack,
that's a horse of another color, as you Americans say.
Attack? Yes.
At last we take the offensive.
Oh, it will be a beautiful attack.
On paper it looks wonderful, and if it succeeds ...
No, I will not say "if." This time it must succeed and it will.
What I've told you, Jordan, is known only to the general staff.
Our only chance to succeed is by a surprise attack.
Now, here is the bridge, over a deep gorge.
It's the only way the enemy can bring up reinforcements.
Tanks, artillery, troops, all must come over this bridge.
I must know it is gone.
Not before the attack, they'd rebuild it.
It must go the minute the attack starts, no sooner, no later.
So the bridge is nothing.
But suppose their soldiers are sitting on it.
You know, sentries on both ends.
What do you do then?
In my country, they say, "Never blow a bridge till you come to it."
That's good, you joke.
In this business, one should joke a little.
I am so serious.
It's why I can joke.
You think you can get through enemy lines tomorrow night?
Sure. Good.
That will give you 3 days to prepare for the dynamiting.
Wait for the attack at dawn, after the third night.
How will I know the exact time?
Well, use these. Listen.
First we attack from the air.
When you hear the explosions, that's your time.
I've got a good guide for you, an old man named Anselmo.
Knows the country like a fox, and the people to help you.
Now, go and find yourself a pretty girl.
But first get a haircut.
Is that an order, General? - Why not?
I don't like your barber.
Up the gorge to the left is the bridge.
Sentry boxes, huh?
At each end, Roberto.
Always two sentries on guard.
Where do the sentries live?
At the road-mender's hut, across the bridge.
You can't see it from here.
The other post is on this side, in that old sawmill.
How many men in the sawmill?
Eight, and a corporal.
The other post, how many men?
Maybe more. We'll find out.
Look!
They always spit in the gorge.
It brings luck.
I wish I could spit that far.
Roberto!
That sentry, he looks like a man from my village.
He's very young.
He must die?
You couldn't do it, Anselmo?
I would kill the sentry, considering the necessity of the bridge.
But if I live later, I'll try to live in such a way, doing no harm to anyone, that it will be forgiven.
Come on, let's get this dynamite somewhere safe.
You wait here, Roberto.
Oh, I can make it, Anselmo.
You want to be shot at, carrying these?
No, not even in a joke.
Go ahead.
Roberto!
He's the boss here, Roberto.
Very strong man.
I can see.
Foreigner?
And a friend. Didn't the old man tell you?
I'm asking you.
I'm here for the Republic.
You know those seals, don't you?
SIM, Service of Military Intelligence.
This is the seal from General Staff They command for the Republic.
In these mountains, I command. No one else.
What's that?
Dynamite.
Good. I can use dynamite.
How much you bring me? None.
What's your name?
What's that to you?
Pablo. He's Pablo.
What for?
What bridge?
That's my business.
In this country, it's my business.
Don't talk so!
You want to die?
No!
Shut your mouth.
This comrade comes for the Republic!
Anselmo!
Help us get this stuff up to your camp.
Hola! What is this that comes?
The old man and a dynamiter.
Hey, that stuff! Not in the cave.
What're you making?
A trap for foxes.
See? Very practical.
He catches rabbits.
If a Gypsy catches rabbits, he says it's foxes.
If he catches a fox, he'll call it an elephant.
And if I catch an elephant?
You'd say it was a tank.
I'll get me a tank, old man!
Some day I'll get me one and you can call it what you please.
Gypsies talk much, kill little.
I'm going for wine.
Bring a cup for me.
You have wine, huh?
And plenty of it.
We eat like generals here.
Yeah, he eats like ten generals.
And what do Gypsies do in the war?
They keep on being Gypsies.
That's a good job.
The best. - How do they call you?
Roberto. And you?
Rafael. Oh, wine!
There will be food soon.
Food!
Oh, you have tobacco!
Yeah, I know these.
Much air and little tobacco.
Ah, we eat!
Hola!
Hola!
That's how I comb it.
Go ahead and eat.
Hey, bread!
How are you called?
María. And you? Roberto.
Been here long?
This long. Three months.
They shaved my head in Valladolid.
I was on the train heading south.
The train Pablo blew at Arévalo.
Many of the prisoners were caught again, but they saved me.
They and Pilar.
We found her hiding in the rocks where she'd run off.
You should have seen her!
No hair at all. Cried all the time.
And if anyone touched her, she'd shiver like a wet dog.
Man, but she was ugly.
God's truth, Roberto.
Though Gypsies usually lie, She looked like a half-drowned kitten.
You blow trains?
I have.
Here?
No, in Extremadura.
In another six months it'll grow out.
Are you his woman?
Pablo's?
You've seen Pablo!
I've seen Rafael too.
No, not the Gypsy.
This is a very strange woman.
Is of no one.
But she cooks well.
Really of no one?
No one.
No one. Nor of you, either.
No.
No. I have no time for women.
No?
María!
María!
Who's that?
Pablo's woman, Pilar.
She's something barbarous! But brave!
A hundred times braver than Pablo.
Pablo was brave in the beginning.
He killed more people than cholera.
Yes, at the start he kill more people than the bubonic plague.
But, Pilar, she is something barbarous!
The Gypsy's afraid of her.
Why not? She hates me. - Why?
She treats me as a time waster.
She doesn't like Gypsies. - What an injustice!
She has Gypsy blood herself.
She knows of what she speaks.
But she has a tongue.
It bites like a bull whip.
What are you saying now, you lazy son of an unmentionable Gypsy?
Answer me, Gypsy!
I was telling this comrade what a kind woman you are, Pilar.
Liar!
This one comes as a dynamiter. - I know that.
Go and relieve Andrés.
He's on guard at the top.
I go, Pilar. I'll see you, Roberto,
when we eat. - Not even in a joke!
3 times today you've eaten.
But I can eat twice more.
Get out of here!
And send me Andrés!
Hola, Inglés.
How are you and the Republic? - Good.
Both good.
I'm happy.
What did that Gypsy say about me?
He said you were much woman.
And I'd say he's right.
And what did you say to the girl, before I came out? - Nothing.
I saw how she was from seeing you.
I only joked with her.
Jokes?
Listen to me, Inglés.
She's young, not hardened as we are.
And she's had a bad time. You understand?
Yes, I guess so.
I'm worried about her.
When do you leave here?
In three days. If I'm still alive.
What made you say that?
That never brings luck.
Let me see your hand.
Well?
Nothing. I saw nothing.
What do you come for?
Blow another train?
No, a bridge.
All the better.
Now we have horses. Let's blow all the bridges and go!
I'm sick of this place.
We are rotting here because there's no fighting.
Only watching Pablo get drunk.
This life is ruining him.
What did you see in my hand?
I saw nothing.
Yes, you did.
I'm only curious. I don't believe in it.
In what do you believe?
In my work.
I saw that.
What else? Nothing else.
The bridge is very difficult? - No.
It is important.
But it can be very difficult?
Yes.
I'm going to look it over again.
How many men have you got here? Five.
The Gypsy is worthless, although his intentions are good.
Pablo, I no longer trust.
Thanks.
I like your way of speaking.
I try to speak frankly.
Then tell me what you saw in my hand.
No.
I saw nothing else.
Go now to the bridge. I look after your equipment.
Let me tell you again, Inglés. I'm glad you've come.
We will understand each other.
Can they not dwell outside?
I don't want dynamite in here. We have fire.
It's far from the fire.
Smoke?
How goes the Gypsy?
Is she going to let you eat again?
Why not?
Is there wine?
Not much left.
Then I'll have some water.
María, is there any water left?
It's too strong, or I'd give you some.
I'd offer it to you, Pablo, but there's not much left.
I have wine.
What drink is it?
Medicine, you wanna taste it?
What's it for?
It changes your ideas.
Yeah?
Bitter as gall!
I'd rather be sick than have the medicine.
That's the wormwood.
I'm glad you don't like it.
What are you saying there?
I was explaining the medicine.
María!
What's that?
The bridge. showing the construction.
Look how it seems.
Why, it's the bridge itself!
How do you blow a bridge?
That's what I'm figuring out.
No!
I don't go for the bridge.
Neither me nor my people.
Then we'll do it alone.
Old one?
Yes. - Without this coward.
Hey, you!
What did you say?
Nothing for you. I spoke to Roberto.
My orders are to blow the bridge.
In these mountains we hide.
My business is to take care of my people.
Live one place, fight somewhere else.
Fight, raid, blow trains, bridges, but way off.
Not here where they will hunt us.
You'll clear out. You've got horses.
I have 5 horses and 8 people.
You and the old man with the loud mouth make ten.
Now if this bridge is blown, we will be hunted.
Hunted from the earth, from the air.
The explosions will fall from the sky on my horses.
Until you had horses, you were one of us.
Now you're rich with horses, you want to retire.
A lie! You know I expose the horses for the cause.
To eat well, yes. To steal, yes.
To murder, yes.
To fight for the Republic, no!
You are an old man who will make trouble with his mouth.
I am an old man not afraid to fight.
I'm an old man without horses.
You might not live long.
I'm an old man who will live until I die.
You will blow no bridge here!
No?
No.
No bridge.
Pilar!
What do you say?
I am for the bridge.
And for the Republic.
What's that, woman?
I am for the bridge and against you. Nothing more.
What do you say, Primitivo?
I am also for the bridge.
Fernando?
To me the bridge means nothing.
I'm for the woman of Pablo.
Andrés!
Yes, equally!
The same, Pilar.
Then we blow the bridge and retreat to the Gredos afterwards.
You with your head of a bull and heart of a hawk!
You think there'll be any "afterwards", from this bridge?
I am for the Republic and the Republic is the bridge!
It means nothing to be hunted like a beast after this thing which brings no profit?
Nor even to die for it?
Don't try to frighten us, coward!
Coward?
Is it cowardly to know what's foolish?
Or am I a leader for nothing?
Haven't I gotten you this far alive?
This foreigner comes to do a thing for the good of the foreigners.
For his goal you want to sacrifice us!
I'm for the good and safety of all.
Safety!
There is no such thing.
Did I spend 9 years with matadors not to learn about fear and safety?
Speak to me of anything but safety!
Look at him. How I believed in him once.
And look what he is now.
From a year of war you've become lazy, - a drunkard and a coward.
Woman!
You have no right to speak like that.
Not before my people and a stranger.
Do you still believe you command here?
Yes.
Here I command!
Here I command!
Haven't you heard them?
Here no one commands but me now.
I should shoot you and the foreigner both.
Try it and see what happens.
Listen to me, drunkard!
You understand now who commands?
Why, I command!
No! Listen!
Take the wax from your ears.
Listen well.
I command.
Alright.
Alright.
You command.
And if you want, he can command too.
Maybe I am lazy and drink too much.
Maybe you think I'm a coward, though you know better.
Maybe.
But I'm not stupid.
Now if you're a woman as well as a commander, show us something to eat.
María!
Take the food.
You must be careful.
Pablo? - If you sleep, yes.
Ok. I'll keep my eyes open. What's he doing?
Only drinking.
There will be danger if he begins to hide the sadness.
If he pretends to be friendly, then he's made a decision.
I heard Pilar say it.
What kind of decision?
Who knows?
After what's happened, it'd mean danger for you.
I'll look after myself.
I'm thinking about the bridge.
I'm thinking about you, Roberto.
Why, María?
Well, I don't know.
Did I muss it?
All day I wanted you to do that.
I too, María.
Where's Pablo?
Ah, he's gone to the horses.
Now you have to kill him.
Why don't you Kill him before he kills you.
He won't kill me.
We waited for you to kill him. Why didn't you?
And turn Pilar against me?
Without a woman there is no control here.
So, he takes the horses and goes. What about your bridge then?
You don't know Pablo.
Now men, you have tightened your garters.
You, my friend, you know I'm not a coward.
You are no woman, no fool.
Nor any colt of a girl either that makes a man crazy with hunger.
You don't lie, make insults, and leave me, like my people.
Yes, eat. eat, my friend.
Pay no attention to the woman. You, you know who commands.
You and me, we'll show them who's stupid.
Not me, not you, my friend.
Get out of sight!
Ours?
German and Italian.
Can they see the horses?
They're not looking for horses. - Man!
I could see their faces!
I spit in their faces!
I spit in the milk of their mothers!
I tell you they could see the horses.
Wipe the sweat from your face.
They could see the cigarette butts.
Hey, wait!
They may be back!
Coward!
Go to your horses!
Have you seen planes like this before?
Never, Inglés.
Get inside.
I'm going with Pilar to El Sordo. We've got to have more horses.
You know your sentry posts. Keep a close watch.
Anselmo, write down everything that passes along the road.
I can't write, Roberto.
I'll show you how to write.
Look how Roberto can make pictures.
That's a truck, see?
And here's a soldier on a horse.
Look!
Tank!
I will catch me a tank like that, old man.
Whatever passes, make a mark.
The man on the horse is for cavalry.
Each mark means a troop of twenty mounted men. Understand?
Each troop a mark.
In this way I can write, yes.
That's an educated pencil.
One paper is for moving up the road And the other for moving down the road.
When you get back tonight I'll know what they're moving up to the front.
Better get along, and take some food with you.
Can I write too, ha?
I want you to Watch the bridge and sentry posts.
See if more soldiers are brought, and at what intervals the guard is changed.
What is "intervals"?
How many hours the sentries stay on and what time changes are made.
Without a watch?
Take mine.
What a watch!
Look at what a complication.
Such a watch should be able to read and write. - Don't fool with it.
Can you tell time?
Why not?
12 o'clock day ... hunger.
6 o'clock night ... drunk.
With luck.
Ten o'clock now. - You don't need to be a clown.
Do what I tell you and keep out of sight.
Salud, Gypsy.
Did you see the air machines?
See them?
We ate them for breakfast!
Is there food, Pilar? I'm hungry.
It's a long walk from La Granja.
La Granja? - Yes, Roberto.
You wish tobacco? - You?
Didn't you sleep here last night?
For a while, yes.
Then I thought of my woman and children in La Granja.
Then I went to La Granja.
Wasn't that dangerous?
You have to get past their sentries.
That's why I only go at night.
Oh, María!
See much movement along the road last night?
Nothing.
A few trucks as usual. Cars. A few guns, as usual.
No troops.
Pick up any news in town?
But nothing.
Still goes battle in the north.
Oh, yes ... there is talk of the Republic preparing an attack.
What?
That we are preparing an offensive.
Where?
Perhaps here, perhaps near Navacerrada.
Have you heard of it?
Where is that talk from?
Where? Surely you know how rumors fly?
The officers talks in the cafes and the waiters listen.
They say this is an offensive of some size, but ... it's only a rumor.
What else did you hear?
Nothing, man.
Oh, yes ... there is some talk that the Republicans Want try to blow the bridges, but ...
Are you joking?
This one doesn't joke, Inglés.
Bad luck he doesn't.
A man like me is never alarmed by rumors, Pilar.
Remember anything more?
No.
They talk as usual of soldiers to be sent to clear us out of these mountains.
There is some talk troops are on the way. But it's always like that.
It's not to give any importance to.
Only rumors as usual.
Rumors! Everything as usual!
Things are bad in the north, as usual!
That troops come to hunt us out, as usual!
An offensive here, as usual!
Man, you are a monument to "as usual".
But the last two, Pilar, are only rumors.
My mother! - Let's go, Pilar.
Who'll look after my things?
The man of rumors.
Fernando, guard the explosives.
Very well, Pilar. Calm yourself.
There is nothing to worry about. Only rumors.
Wait!
Hello, María.
Hello, Roberto.
Inglés!
Hola, Pilar!
Hola!
Hola, Joaquín! - Hola, María!
Tell Sordo I'm coming with Inglés!
A good boy, Inglés.
El Sordo saved him when his family was killed, and now they are like father and son.
Inglés, tell me, have you known many women?
They meant nothing.
I think you lie.
Well, maybe ... a little.
And for this one, for María,
you care much?
Let's get on.
What is the reason for the bridge, Inglés?
Will there be an attack?
And the airplanes this morning?
Does that mean the enemy's found out? They're preparing a counterattack?
I only know one thing for certain.
What's that?
You have to shout.
One thing is certain.
The bridge must go when the attack starts.
And to do that we've got to have more horses and more men.
When do we blow it?
Day after ... day after tomorrow!
Why not tonight?
Orders.
How do you get whiskey?
Make it!
No, no, no, I joke.
This is good whiskey, we got it on a raid.
No ice. Plenty ice up there.
Too far.
Easier blow the bridge tonight.
I'd be shot for it.
Do it in daylight, we'll all be shot. - Not if we have horses.
Hoom?
Not if we have enough horses.
We'll be out of here before they come.
I have five horses and four men.
Five men, Sordo.
So it is. Five with the boy.
Five men and five horses.
That's ten horses for 15 people.
We've got to have five more horses. For the retreat, yes.
No one will get out alive without a horse.
How can you get horses? - Steal 'em.
Only soldiers have horses now.
Soldiers and thieves like us.
Can you get five more tonight?
What? - Tonight!
We can try.
Good.
Maybe not so good.
Not good if it snows.
Horses make tracks and soldiers follow tracks.
It is too late for snow, Sordo. - Hoom
It's the month of May!
And the sun is shining.
Look at the youngest general.
Already he's stealing horses.
He's always talking, Pilar, how he carried the girl from the train.
Let's see you carry her down the hill, my boy.
Now you make fun of me.
Wait, Joaquín!
I'll carry you on my shoulders.
Look, Inglés!
Look at the bullfighter. He's crying. Don't mock, Pilar.
He was telling me about his sister.
She was a prisoner as I was, and he just heard that she's dead.
I'm your sister now, Joaquín.
We all love you.
We are your family. - Yes.
Including the Inglés.
Of course.
You hear that, boy?
The Inglés is your brother.
We're all brothers, Joaquín.
Thank you, Inglés. Don't worry.
I'll get you a horse tonight.
One for María too.
What about me?
Do I have to kiss you too to get a horse?
It's been years since I kissed a bullfighter.
Hold this, Inglés, till I get a good kiss at him.
Look at him!
He's afraid of a kiss as he was afraid of the bulls!
You don't need to make a joke.
When I kiss, it won't be as a sister.
This trick of kissing as a sister!
Don't be so brutal, Pilar!
I love you very much, but why do you speak so brutally?
Why do you think, girl?
Rest, Pilar!
You are tired.
Shut up!
Nobody asked your advice!
You think I'm an old woman.
Sit down.
Many things tire me.
And the one of them is to be old and ugly.
And another is to see panic in the face of a boy when I say as a joke that I might kiss him.
It's not true. You didn't see that.
What d' you know, with your face?
I have an evil temper today, and I'm jealous.
How foolish.
I'm an ugly old woman, and I love you very much, child.
I love you too. You're not ugly.
Go on, I'm not ugly!
I was born ugly.
Do you know how an ugly woman feels?
Do you know what it is to be ugly all your life ...
And to feel in here that you are beautiful?
You are beautiful.
Try to use your head and not your heart, and listen.
I'm telling you things of much interest. Does it interest you?
María's right.
Two of a kind!
You are a prize for any woman. If you'd ever let go of yourself.
And this one ... this one is a gift to any man, if she could cook a little better.
Give me a cigarette and listen.
Life is very curious.
I would have made a good man, but I'm all woman and all ugly.
Yet many men have loved me.
Is that strange?
I don't think you're ugly.
Don't lie to me.
Or has it begun to work with you too! ?
No, no, no. Look, I am ugly.
Yet one can have a feeling here that blinds a man while he loves you.
He thinks you are beautiful, and one day, for no reason at all ... he sees you ugly, as you really are.
And he's not blind any more.
Then you see yourself as ugly as he sees you.
And you lose your man and your feeling.
Then one day the feeling ... that idiotic feeling that you are beautiful, grows inside of you again.
And another man sees you and thinks you're beautiful.
And it's all to do over again.
Now I am past it.
But it still might come again.
Lift your head, this silliness is over.
I was only jealous of your 19 years.
It isn't a jealously that lasts.
You won't be 19 always.
You see, I have evil thoughts, Inglés.
If I were 19, I'd take you away from this cropped head, even with my ugly face.
No, no, sit there.
I have a surprise for you. Close your eyes.
You too, Inglés.
No, tightly, both of you.
Pilar, Pilar, wait!
Shut up, Inglés!
I'm bored with both of you!
Pilar!
Let her go, Roberto.
Don't you want to be alone with me? - Of course.
And I want to be with you, Roberto. - Pilar knows it.
She knows everything. - I'm beginning to believe it.
Will she be alright?
You don't have to worry about her.
It's a wonderful day, Roberto.
What are you worrying about?
About you. Me?
Why?
Because I'm so happy?
I wish you weren't here, María.
I mean it ...
I'm thinking about what will happen to you after the bridge.
Can't I go with you?
El Sordo will get us horses for sure.
I know we need them for the escape.
You've got to understand, María. I'm in this war to the finish.
I can't have anything serious in my life.
A man doing what I'm doing never knows what's going to happen.
Whatever happens to you will happen to me.
Haven't you anyone in the Republic? No relatives all?
You must have people somewhere.
My father and my mother, I saw them killed.
My father was the mayor of our town and a Republican.
When the Nationalists came, they lined up the Republicans against the wall.
My father cried out very loud, "Long live the Republic!"
And then they shot him.
But my mother was not a Republican.
She had no politics.
But she loved my father and she couldn't say that.
So she just looked at my father who lay there at her feet, and she said:
Long live my husband who was the mayor of this town."
She said it very loud, like a shriek, and then they shot and she fell, and I wanted to got to her, but we were all tied by the wrists in a long line of girls and women.
And I wanted to be shot too and say, "Long live the Republic ... and my mother and my father."
But instead, there was no more shooting.
They herded us up the hill and through the streets to the square.
My, my father's office was in the city hall, but they took us across the street to the barber shop.
I want to tell you.
No. Don't.
Roberto ... are you angry about something?
Of course not.
I'm glad.
I won't cry any more.
Oh Roberto ...
I like ...
I don't know how to kiss or I would kiss you.
Where do the noses go?
Always I've wondered where the noses would go.
They're not in the way, are they?
I always thought they would be in the way.
Look, I can do it myself.
María.
Did I do it wrong?
Look, Pilar!
Roberto fell in the brook.
Already she makes you blind, Inglés?
Can't even see where you're going.
Hola, Inglés.
Come sit down here where it's warm.
I'll take your shoes and put them in the smoke of the fire to dry.
Hey, don't burn them. I don't want to stand around here barefooted.
María, fetch me some dry socks.
The lord and master.
Here's the key.
The pack is locked.
Who's on guard at the top?
Agustín.
Put these on. Dry your feet well.
You can't dry them with your hair?
What a swine!
Hit him with a chunk of wood, María.
I'm joking because I'm happy.
You are happy?
Yes. I think everything goes well.
Keep this under your feet until your shoes are dry.
Must you care for him as a child?
No. As a man who's cold and wet.
And a man who has just come home to his house.
Take the coffee, worthless one.
Does it always grow dark this early?
No, Inglés. It's the weather.
The wind is very disorderly.
Getting colder out.
Yes, Inglés.
It is not correct to be so cold in the month of May.
Any movement on the road, Anselmo?
Not much, roberto
It's all marked on the papers.
Gypsy, what about the bridge?
Six hour interval.
I stayed till they changed the watch, at noon and at six.
It was a long watch, Inglés. And cold!
My ... my bones brea ...
How about the sawmill post?
Eight men and a corporal. - No more arrived.
What about the road-mender's hut?
I didn't get that far.
I remembered what you said.
To be careful.
Only ten cars?
All written down, Roberto.
Inglés!
How do you like it, Pilar?
Very beautiful, the snow, huh?
Get out of my sight!
God help El Sordo.
If it snows all night, it may cover his tracks.
If, if!
How do you like it, woman?
How do you like to command when it snows?
Shut up, drunkard!
I know why you went to see El Sordo.
Horses make tracks in the snow, hey, Inglés? Yeah.
Now there will be no offensive.
No bridge. No. Just snow.
And no making love in the heather!
Watch your mouth!
No. Let me.
María!
Wipe the table clean, María!
Wipe your own spillings!
Wipe first your chin, drunkard, and then the table!
Pay no attention to him. He's drunk.
Fix my shoes, María.
Are you really drunk?
Why not?
But not too drunk to watch your mouth!
No one on guard at the top?
In this storm?
What for? No soldiers will move in these mountains tonight.
Pilar, bring me something hot to eat!
Wine, Inglés?
I thought I was Roberto.
I call you Inglés before the others.
Roberto?
Don Roberto!
How is Don Roberto?
Fine, Don Pablo.
How's Bacchus?
Who is Bacchus?
You know. He is your constant companion.
I don't know such a man.
You say funny things, Inglés.
Sure, I do.
I'm a laugh every minute.
Pay no attention.
Tell us, Inglés ... why have you come so far to fight for our Republic?
A man fights for what he believes in, Fernando.
In his own country.
Maybe you feel I'm sticking my nose into other people's business, but I don't feel that way.
It's not only Spain fighting here.
It's Germany and Italy on one side And Russia on the other.
And the Spanish are right in the middle of it.
The Nazis and fascists ... are against democracy and against the communists.
They're using your country to test their new war machinery.
Their tanks and dive-bombers.
So they can destroy democracies like England ...
France and my country before we get armed and ready to fight.
Were you always a Republican?
And your father?
Sure. He always voted Republican.
Did they shoot him for it?
No. They don't shoot you for being a Republican in America.
Roberto was a professor. He told me this afternoon.
Not a professor, María. An instructor.
That's the same thing. He was a teacher in a college.
The professor. has no beard.
He's a false professor.
Shut up!
What did you teach, Inglés?
Spanish. That's how I got to know Spain.
No beard.
He has no beard. He's a false professor.
Stop it!
Wouldn't it be easier to teach English?
Why shouldn't he teach Spanish?
Doesn't he speak it?
Yes, but in a way it is undignified for a foreigner to teach Spanish.
I mean nothing against you, Inglés.
He doesn't teach it to Spaniards!
I should hope not ...
Let me finish, you mule!
He teaches Spanish to Americans.
Can't they speak Spanish?
Mule! North Americans speak English!
No beard, no beard.
Enough!
But he's got no beard. Beard ... - No beard.
He does have a beard.
You should know, girl.
Pay no attention, Inglés.
He's drunk. - I don't think he's so drunk.
Yes.
Yes, I am drunk.
I doubt it. Cowardly, yes!
You try to provoke me, Inglés?
No, you won't get rid of me that way.
I said cowardly, not drunk!
See?
See, I don't provoke.
Signal to the woman that you've failed.
Pilar had nothing to do with it.
You spoke to the girl as a coward.
I don't provoke.
See, woman?
I teach the professor I don't provoke.
I'll still be alive, when you're all dead!
I'm not stupid.
I don't provoke.
I don't provoke.
To the Professor, to the Señora commander, and to all the illusioned ones.
That's silly.
It's a waste of good wine.
I don't provoke.
I am drunk.
The wise man gets drunk to spend his time with fools.
Get out!
Yeah. Yeah, I go.
I'll go to the horses. They have more sense than men.
Tell them about the bridge, Professor, and how to escape afterwards.
Who will lead your patriots in the retreat?
Get out!
It's still falling, Inglés.
Let me go!
I'll kill him! - Give me that rifle!
Why didn't you kill him last night?
What do you think he'll do now?
He will toss a bomb in here.
It's his style. - Give me your pistol.
I'll shoot him.
You want to blow us up?
What fools we are!
Why didn't you kill him last night?
He's got to die now!
Pilar?
What do you say, Pilar?
Yes.
Whatever you will,
I'm for it now.
Then let all speak.
Andrés, what do you say?
Yes, kill him!
Primitivo?
Kill him.
Agustín?
Do you need to ask? Kill him!
Fernando?
Don't forget, Inglés, he's smart and he knows the get out.
Who will lead our retreat after the bridge?
El Sordo!
He knows the way.
Pilar, tell him that El Sordo will lead us.
Couldn't we hold him as a prisoner?
Who would look after him as a prisoner?
He is right, Fernando. It would take us all to watch him.
Why not sell him to the enemy?
Shut up, Gypsy.
That's filthy!
No worse than Pablo.
If you'd blind him, he will be easy to handle.
Watch your tongue, Gypsy!
Didn't Pablo blind the civil guard who was wounded?
Speak of blinding again and you go with Pablo.
Pilar, I haven't been allowed to finish yet.
Finish, then, finish!
I still maintain we need Pablo.
We should reason with him and point out that his conduct ...
Stop it!
Even here one man can make a bureaucracy with his mouth!
You've voted to kill him.
Now have done with it!
Kill him when he returns. - I must wait for him to make the first move.
Why wait?
Kill him, man!
In cold blood?
Cold!
You Ingleses are all cold. Give me your gun!
I'm not cold. I'm burning!
Not in here. No shooting in here.
You'll see how cold my blood is when that coward comes back!
Ugly. All of it's ugly!
Remember one thing, Inglés.
He wasn't always like this.
When the war broke out, he wasn't the man you see now.
Brutal, yes, but a leader without fear.
Without Pablo's help, the Nationalists would have taken our town ... the day the revolution began, for many Nationalists lived there.
But Pablo organized the people, and in the night ... all suspects were dragged from their beds and locked up in the city hall.
Then in the dark, he surrounded the police barracks, cut the telephone wires and placed dynamite under the wall.
When morning came, he called on the civil guards to surrender, but they wouldn't.
So he blew the wall open.
But then there was a shout for us to stop firing and four civil guards walked out with their hands up.
Pablo said, "Show us how to die, you who have always done the killing."
What are you going to do?", the officer asked. "Shoot you."
Pablo passed behind them.
I can hear the pistol even now and see the head of each man fall.
One held his head still when the pistol touched it.
One shivered in his whole body and his head was shaking.
Only one put his hands in front of his eyes and he was the last one.
The hat fell from his head and Pablo said: "Look Pilar, he's polite ...
He takes off his hat for a woman like you!"
A crowd was gathering in the plaza before the city hall.
Why is it done this way?", they asked Pablo.
To save bullets," he said, "and to make all of you share in it."
I had picked up that hat of the civil guard and a man said:
Pilar, that's bad taste.
We're done with civil guards now."
Drunkards yelled, as if at a bullfight:
Let the bull out!
Pablo, let the bull out!"
And then everyone shouted: "Here comes the first one!"
It was Don Perito García, the mayor.
He walked between the lines and nothing happened.
He passed two men, four men, eight men, and nothing happened.
From the roof someone shouted, "What's the matter, coward?"
But nothing happened.
I was watching one man who had a dispute with the mayor about a piece of land, and who hated him.
And it was this man who first raised his flail.
Don Faustino Rivera was known as an annoyer of girls.
He wanted to be known as a bullfighter and went much with them and Gypsies.
But he was a coward and was considered a joke.
But he was inspired by the example of Don García and he stood there looking handsome and brave, and he made his face scornful.
Now the lines began to shout, "Listen Don Faustino, there are beautiful girls over the cliff, why don't you chase them?"
It was then I knew that the lines had become savage, caused by the insult of Don García and the cowardice of Don Faustino.
Don Guillermo wasn't a bad man.
He was only in politics because of his wife.
I heard her screaming, "Guillermo, husband, wait.
I'll go with you!"
He couldn't see her without his glasses but he looked up and waved his hands.
And no one would hit him.
Then a drunkard yelled, "Guillermo!"
What bothers Pilar?", they asked me.
I'm sick," I told them.
And they said, "Us too. We'll take no further part in it."
But the worst was yet to come, Inglés, when Pablo opened the city hall door and let the mob in to kill the rest.
For yes, it was now a mob, lacking any organization.
The snow has stopped, Inglés.
Now we'll have good weather for the bridge.
Yes, I've come back to help you.
I cannot desert Pilar and my people.
Wait, man!
What trick is this, drunkard?
No trick, Pilar.
I've changed my mind, that's all.
You're right about the bridge and I'm with you now.
You'll need me for the retreat.
Just what I said.
You were listening!
You're afraid of being killed. That's why you've changed.
Do you think I like to hear how we killed those men?
If I could bring them back to life, I'd do it.
Liar! No, I mean it.
I wish I could bring them back to life,
even Don Ricardo who cursed me.
Stop it!
Yes, I would restore them all to life.
That's God's truth.
And it's also true that I'm with you now.
I was drunk.
Now I'm not drunk and I've changed my mind.
Either trust me or not, but no one can get you to the Gredos as I can.
I believe you. But take an oath.
Are you with us and for the bridge?
Yes, man.
You think it can be successful despite the snow?
There will be no snow.
You have confidence?
Why not?
Fools!
Lunatics!
You're all crazy if you believe him!
What, Roberto?
A trooper.
What does it mean?
I don't know.
See anything?
No.
Are you sure it was a trooper?
Yes.
Where's Pablo?
Man, what a horse!
Never mind a horse, get in the saddle.
This horse must make tracks out again.
You have much sense, Inglés.
I'll ride him in the hills until the snow's melted.
Keep your eyes open. There's bound to be more cavalry.
Go back to the cave and get the machine gun and my binoculars.
We've got to cover the pass. Both of you give him a hand.
Go back to that soldier ... and see if you can find more clips.
And leave his pockets alone!
Roberto!
Roberto, I'm coming with you!
Go back. Tell Pilar to pack.
We may have to run for it.
No.
Go back, María.
There may be a fight.
I'll help you.
No! - Let me help you.
Go back!
Let me go with you.
I want to help. - Then go back!
Kiss me.
You're shameless.
What's happened to that Gypsy?
I saw him coming down.
Then he saw a rabbit and went after it.
Fine time to go hunting!
Primitivo, climb up that rock as high as you can.
If you see soldiers, throw a stone for a signal.
Wait a minute. - If you see one soldier, raise your rifle like this.
Like this?
If more than one, pump it like this.
One for each soldier. Understand?
Yes.
Anselmo, go to Agustín and hold the gun's legs, if I have to shoot.
Here, hold this for me.
I'm liable to shoot me a Gypsy.
Look!
Now we'll have fresh meat.
Does something annoy Roberto?
If you weren't a Gypsy, I'd shoot you!
Look at how fat they are!
Get down!
Rifles!
Now the soldiers are hunting.
Wait here.
Is it Pablo?
El Sordo.
Come, Inglés, now they need us.
Where?
To join in with El Sordo.
To die there?
Don't you realize they're lost?
It's too risky. We have to think about the bridge.
Bridge?
Why that's our friend El Sordo!
Listen ... - I listen to that!
Are you afraid to fight for our friends?
Roberto!
We could hear the firing at the cave. I was afraid ...
I was afraid.
You shouldn't have come here.
I let her, Inglés. She was half crazy.
She thought you were fighting.
Why aren't we fighting?
They want to go to El Sordo.
Have you lost your minds?
What kind of locos do we have in our camp?
Men, not women!
Then act like men!
Don't you see you'll die soon enough?
Swallow your tongue woman and choke yourself! Silence!
What use is courage if you have no head?
El Sordo has both. He'll understand.
When he was coming with the Horses they found him.
With the fine cover to keep them aside, Looks like he did his best to lead them away from us.
Did you hit him?
Pot full of grease-backed bat.
I can tell you who's a pot full of grease: The Pilar.
She knows we are dying here.
What could Pilar do?
Take them from the rear. - How?
They're all around the hill.
100, 200 ... maybe more now.
Bandidos, cobardes!
Can you hear me?
You sons of four-legged devils!
Surrender now, you bandits, before our planes blow you to bits!
Will they send planes?
With bombs or machine guns?
Both, my son.
I'm giving you a chance to surrender before the planes come.
You hear what I am saying, bandidos? Let's insult him.
Maybe he'll show his head.
Are you ready to surrender?
Who has a big pistol? - Here.
The planes are coming!
Are you ready to surrender?
He can't wait for the planes.
He wants to be a hero, to lead us back with a rope around our necks.
Have you seen any movement since the shots?
No sir.
What do you think?
I don't believe it.
Why shouldn't they do it?
They knew they had to die.
It's better than being bombed or captured, isn't it? I think it's a trick.
What about the planes?
They should have come a long time ago.
How many shots did you count? - Five.
It's ridiculous to hide.
if they are dead!
Ridiculous to hide down here from dead men!
I think we should wait for the planes, sir.
Fire, cowards, if you are alive!
Fire on a man who has no fear of you!
Shoot, you saffron-bellied swine!
Now do you believe me?
No one's alive up there.
You!
Go up and see.
Don't you hear me?
Yes, my captain.
Then go!
Do you hear me?
Yes, my captain.
Why don't you go then?
I don't want to, my captain.
You don't want to?
You don't want to? - I'm afraid, my captain.
Captain Mora!
Lieutenant Berrendo!
It is possible the soldier is right.
Right to say he's afraid? - Right to say he is afraid!
Right to say he doesn't want to obey an order?
No sir.
Right that it's a trick!
Don't you hear me, they're all dead.
You mean our comrades on the slope?
I agree, sir.
Very well, the sniper stays here.
I'll take care of him later.
You and I will go to the top. - Not me.
What?
I will go if you order me.
But under protest.
No, I'll go alone.
The smell of cowardice is too strong here.
Assassins!
Cowards!
Shoot me!
Kill me!
Can you hear me coming?
No, you can't hear me coming.
You think I'm a coward like the others? Shoot me!
Kill me!
Shoot me!
Kill me!"
Cowards!
Look at him coming.
Scum of the earth! - What an animal!
Shoot me if you are alive!
Look at him stride.
This one is for me.
Do you hear me?
This one we take with us.
No, you don't hear.
Keep walking.
Cowards!
Look at the stars. He's a captain.
Stick out your chest, little captain.
I will kill you with a bullet! - Don't stop.
Don't be late, captain. - You vermin! - A long voyage ...
Fire! Cowards! If you are alive!
Now comrade voyager, close enough.
Come on, voyager.
Can you hear me coming?
No, you can't hear me coming.
I am coming.
Kill me!
Shoot me!"
Joaquín!
Quick!
A little higher!
Pilar!
Pilar!
Hola, Pilar. - Hola.
Salud, Roberto. - Salud.
Salud, Pilar.
Look at him. Already at the wine!
Did you come back for us, or the wine?
Both.
He came back for his horses.
Much riding, Inglés.
I couldn't turn back till the snow has melted.
Didn't you run into the cavalry?
A good horse, the new one.
I took to high ground and came back through the hills.
No food, Pilar?
Where have you been? - Guarding the pass below.
We had to wait until there was no more cavalry.
Inglés!
Inglés! I was with El Sordo.
You were in the fight?
No.
On my way back here ...
It was dark and I went up the hill.
Five dead at the top.
They'd taken their heads.
Joaquín too?
No heads ...
Now let the fighting come.
No heads. - Inglés!
Anselmo says there is much movement across the bridge.
I was just leaving the lookout when it started.
What?
Guns, trucks, armored cars, even tanks.
Tanks?
Everything moving up toward the front.
I marked it all down.
I waited till the second column had crossed. - Anything more coming?
Yes, I could hear another column as I came up through the pass.
You want me go back and to watch? - Not now.
Were these trucks full of soldiers?
Yes.
What does it mean?
They know the Republic is going to attack when the sun rises.
Yes, now they know.
They move up to meet our offensive.
Who knows the way through to the Republicans? - I do.
I need you at the bridge.
Who else?
I know it.
Have you been through before?
Yes, Twice. - 8 hours, nearly 9 hours.
Can you make it to Navacerrada?
I can try.
I could do it in less time, with luck and no pack.
I need you here.
Our route was longer because we carried explosives. It was safer.
I will get there as well as another.
And if anything happens, Anything could happen to anyone.
This dispatch is for General Golz. Remember the name, "Golz".
Where will I find him?
Ask when you get to our lines.
This seal ought to get you through our lines.
If you have problems, show this here.
You've got seven hours at the most.
The attack is set for sunrise.
I prefer to be with you at the bridge.
Get this to General Golz and we won't blow the bridge.
We'll all escape to the Gredos safely.
Remember, the bridge's got to go if the attack starts.
Pablo!
Pablo, come back!
Pilar!
Pablo has gone!
Didn't I tell you he was a coward?
You and your confidence!
If it wasn't for you, I would have killed him last night!
I tell you I have been betrayed.
Betrayed!
Listen to him!
He has been betrayed!
You fool!
No slanders, please!
Forget it!
I'm the one to blame.
Andrés, you better get going.
And good luck.
Should I go back and guard the horses?
Fool! - No.
I'll look after them.
Who will lead the retreat now?
Shut up, Gypsy!
Andrés will get to the general.
Get back in the cave.
Pilar, get everything ready for the bridge.
And get some sleep.
I'll look after the horses.
Look after my things.
Don't shoot, comrades.
Who are you?
A comrade, Andrés Lopez, with a dispatch for General Golz.
Say the password, if you're a comrade!
I don't know any password.
Toss a bomb at him.
No, that would be a great mistake.
He's not alone, Pedro. Toss a bomb! - No.
Please. I'm completely by myself. Allow me to show you my papers.
Sure you're alone?
How many times must I to tell you?
Stand up!
Put your hands above your head!
Come on!
I'm in a big hurry. I have a dispatch for General Golz at Navacerrada.
Where is it?
Inside my shirt How can I show it to you with my hands up?
You're a long way from Navacerrada.
I will take you to Captain Gómez.
Spy!
I brought your robe. I'll fix it for you.
Was this your idea or Pilar's?
Mine. But Pilar told me to come.
Even if she'd told me not to come, I would have come.
Will there be fighting tomorrow?
Are you afraid?
I'm afraid for you so much I do not think of me.
Pilar told me that I'm to go with you, after the bridge.
That you'll take me to the Republic.
You and Pilar will have horses. You'll be safe with Pilar.
That leaves 3 horses for the others.
But I go with you, not Pilar.
I came on foot with the old man and shall go the same way.
No!
Pilar says no one will get out alive without a horse.
But if Andrés gets through, there will be no bridge, will there?
Will there, Roberto?
No.
Maybe I should've sent word sooner about the movements here.
How much time have we left?
A lifetime, María.
I mean until daylight.
Five, six hours.
Pilar told me that time is not important.
Maybe Pilar's right.
Three days and three nights.
Yet they're everything.
Longer than the months in prison. Longer than the years I've lived.
She told me something else when I left the cave:
We must live all our life in the time that remains."
She said ...
What?
What did she tell you?
We would all die tomorrow.
And that you know it too. - She's crazy.
Nothing more than Gypsy superstition.
You don't believe it?
Of course not.
She had a reason for telling me.
She said I must tell you all that happened to me when they shot my mother and father.
You've told me.
No.
No, I didn't tell you what happened when they herded us up the hill
and to the barber shop. - I don't want to hear it.
Two men looked at me and one said,
That's the daughter of the mayor."
The other said, "Commence with her." They took me to the barber shop and put me in the chair and held me.
In the mirror I could only see my mother and my father at the moment of the shooting.
My mother's words were in my head like a scream that went on and on.
And I could fell a pain.
They were pulling at my hair and cutting it off with a razor.
And then they put the braids in my mouth ... and tied them around my neck to make a gag.
Then they ran clippers across my head.
I commenced to cry, because until then I'd been too frozen to feel anything.
In the mirror, I could see the men laugh.
I couldn't look away from the horror my face made with braids in my mouth.
When they took me out, I stumbled over the dead barber.
They had shot him because he belonged to a union.
Then I saw my best friend being dragged in by two more men.
When she saw me, she screamed.
She screamed the whole time they were shoving me across the square and into the doorway and up the stairs of the city hall,
to the office of my father, where they put me on the couch.
María.
The worst things were done there.
Quiet. Don't think about it.
I was going to tell you on the way back from El Sordo, but I was glad when you wouldn't let me.
Then I was happy, as if it had never happened.
Tonight, Pilar said I must tell you everything.
And now you won't love me.
Tomorrow you'll take me through the lines and I'll never see you again.
Never.
You won't want me.
No, Roberto, we can't change things.
But it's true I never kissed any man until you.
When it happened I fought until they tied my arms.
No one's touched you!
You believe that?
I know that.
And you can love me?
I can love you more.
I could see your headlight from afar.
You want to bring down a shelling?
Where is the Lieutenant colonel?
He's asleep. Who is the bandit?
He bears a dispatch for General Golz who commands the attack.
You're crazy.
I know no General Golz, nor no attack.
Get back to your battalion.
Call the Lieutenant colonel.
Away!
Call him!
All you barbers are emotional.
Orderly!
Call the lieutenant colonel.
Don't forget, I'm your superior officer.
I'm not afraid of your threats.
Cynics like you would be eliminated ...
First" is the word you want.
Any word will do so long as they liquidate you.
Liquidated" is a word foreign to Spain.
Shot, then!
That's Spanish, can you understand it?
Yes, but don't talk so loud!
Your emotions bore me.
Hello, Gómez.
Colonel.
What brings you?
Why didn't this get here sooner?
Stupidity.
I'm not sure you can get through now.
Write them a very strong safe-conduct.
You'll need something strong tonight.
We're careful before an offensive.
You know what I've been thinking about?
What I should do to take care of you well.
I'll learn from Pilar and other things you can tell me.
What about me taking care of myself?
But you don't.
You should have hung out your sleeping robe in the sun this morning.
Before the dew comes, it should have been taken in.
Your socks should be washed. I would see that you have two pairs.
What else?
This.
I would learn how to fire it.
That's easy. I'll teach you.
Then if you're wounded,
I could kill you and then myself.
Do you have many ideas like that?
No, not many.
But it's a good one in this war.
Pilar gave me this one and showed me how to use it.
I always keep it with me.
Razor blade?
She says there's no pain if you press quickly and firmly.
And they can't stop it if it's done.
Not if you cut the artery.
How long have you had it?
Ever since I was rescued.
But I'd rather have you shoot me.
Promise me if there's ever any need that you will shoot me.
Sure. I promise.
Thank you very much.
I know it's not easy to do.
But there are other things I can do for you.
Besides shoot me?
Yes.
I can roll cigarettes ... - when your box is empty.
Without spilling tobacco?
And if you're wounded, I'll take care of you, wash you and feed you.
Maybe I won't be wounded.
If you're sick ...
I'll make soup and read to you.
Maybe I won't get sick.
Then I'll bring you coffee.
Maybe I don't like coffee.
This morning you had two cups.
Suppose I get tired of coffee,
I'm not wounded or sick, I give up smoking, have only one pair of socks, and roll up my robe myself.
What then?
Then I'll cut your hair with Pilar's scissors.
I don't like that.
Neither do I. I like your hair the way it is.
So if there's nothing to do for you, I'll sit by you and watch you.
And in the nights we'll make love.
You are shameless.
If you don't love me, I love you enough for both.
I was asleep.
I'm sorry I woke up.
I didn't know I was sleeping.
It was so beautiful in your house.
My house? - Yes.
In America.
The one you told me about. Where you were a little boy.
Does the stairway turn at the top, like this?
And there is the door to your mother's room?
Yes, that's how it was.
Your mother was there, and your grandfather ...
who fought in the American Civil War.
He's dead.
He was there, just as you described him.
I liked him very much.
And I loved your mother.
She was holding a child who looked exactly like my Roberto.
When I asked her whose son it was, she said, "Why, it's yours, María."
That's why I had to look at you.
Maybe you weren't dreaming.
No, I was there, just as real as I'm here now.
Can't you wait till I take you there?
Oh Roberto, that, too, is like a dream, like a wonderful dream.
My hair amuses you because it's odd.
But every day it's growing.
And it will be long and I will not look ugly.
Perhaps you will love me very much.
All the things you've told me tonight, it's ... it's as if you'd already taken me to Madrid and to America.
That's just the beginning.
Wait till this war is over! Do I please you?
Will you always take me with you?
Unless you run away from me.
No, I'll never go away from you.
I loved you when I first saw you,
I always have, though I never saw you before.
Now I'm your woman. I'll always be your woman.
Always!
Where is the headquarters of General Golz of the 35th division? - Not here.
I was told he was in the vicinity.
What is here?
The comandancia.
Of what?
Who are you?
Captain Gómez of the 65th brigade and I ask where is General Golz.
I can hear the wind in the trees.
Now it will soon be light.
Will we ever come back?
Some day, María.
And stay here again?
Some day.
Do you think Andrés got through?
We can't tell until sunrise.
Are you afraid?
Not now.
I love you, Roberto. Always remember.
I love you as I love my father and mother, as I love our unborn children, as I love what I love most in the world, and I love you more.
Always remember.
I'll remember.
Nothing can ever part us now, can it?
Nothing, María.
Inglés!
Inglés!
What is it, Pilar?
What's wrong?
It must have been Pablo!
Pablo's gone. What do you mean?
Your exploder!
The box that explodes the dynamite.
When I stirred up the fire for coffee, I found it.
What?
It was under the ashes.
I thought you were guarding it.
I slept with your things!
You slept well!
He must have done it last night before we got back.
Maybe it will work again.
Is there no other way to explode the charges?
Yes, sure.
A bad way, but I can do it.
That swine!
What is the way, Inglés?
Get me your hand grenades.
Do they always explode?
Yes, but not strong enough.
I didn't ask that. Have they always exploded?
Always.
I've brought 3 more men from the band of Elias.
I've come back, Pilar, and I've brought more men for the bridge.
Did you do that?
I had a moment of weakness.
Kill him, Inglés!
Yes, I meant to leave.
Having seen what happened to El Sordo, I was afraid to die.
But having done such a thing, I was lonely.
Do you understand loneliness?
I understand cowardice!
Don't mock me, woman. Don't you see I've come back?
I ...
I've thought of a way to explode the dynamite.
So have I.
The only reason I don't shoot you is because we need you.
I've brought more men for the bridge, Inglés.
They think I'm still the leader here.
Or they wouldn't have followed me.
You are if you wish. For the fighting, yes.
I suppose when a man has something once, always something remains.
Our men are waiting below. Tell them we're coming.
Don't worry about the retreat.
Now we have three more horses.
And three more men!
Maybe they won't need their horses.
You have much control, Inglés.
I'm glad he's back. No matter what he is, we need him.
One last thing I must tell you.
In that thing of the hand ...
What thing of the hand?
No, listen. Don't be angry.
When I looked in your hand, it was just Gypsy humbug.
Gypsies do that to make themselves important. - Sure, sure.
Forget it.
I don't want you to worry.
Who's worrying?
The truth is, I saw only happiness for you and the cropped head.
I know that.
And I don't need a nurse.
I care for you very much, Inglés.
Remember that and don't worry.
Everything will go well at the bridge.
Sure. Let's go.
Get your things together.
Are the orders clear now? - Yes.
Take the road-mender's hut, destroy the post and stop anything from getting through to the bridge.
Right. But not a move unless you hear the falling of bombs.
Yeah. Clear?
You, Pilar, the same with the sawmill.
Don't shoot unless we hear the bombs.
Don't alarm the sentries unless you hear the bombs.
Don't worry about the retreat, Inglés. We'll have plenty of horses.
Get along Inglés before he steals the rest of your things.
You don't understand me, woman. We understand each other.
Nobody understands you.
Neither God, nor your mother, nor I.
Nor you, either.
Come.
Goodbye. See you soon.
Goodbye, Roberto. Take much care.
Of course.
Don't cry.
No, I don't. But come back to me.
I will.
Don't worry if you hear firing.
Only come back quickly.
Bye, María.
Salud, Roberto.
Get across the gorge and don't fire unless I do.
When the sentry is eliminated, come to the middle of the bridge.
It is all clear to me.
I will do as you order.
When you fire, don't think of it as a man, but as a target.
And if anything happens to me, you'll have to finish the job ... as I showed you.
Go now.
Until soon, Roberto.
Until soon, Anselmo.
Captain Gómez, 65th brigade. An urgent dispatch for General Golz.
Why didn't this get here sooner?
Stupidity and crazy suspicion.
General Golz!
Urgent!
But I just spoke to him.
Segovia?
I'll try there.
No, no, no!
Get me position Ávila!
Where's General Golz?
Planes 1?
Get me Planes 1!
Can't you call the airfield?
General Golz!
Not there?
I called Segovia!
Get me Segovia again!
Quick, man!
Stop the bombardment!
You think I want to get shot?
Yes, Golz.
Golz!
General Golz?
From Jordan?
Yes, read it.
What?
Too late, Duval!
That means we're done for.
This time we fail.
Too bad.
Yes, too bad.
Rope!
Hand grenade.
Other side!
Please have him be all right because all my heart is at the bridge.
Please bring him back to me, and I'll do anything you say, ever.
Because there isn't any me. I'm only with him.
Please take care of him for me.
Take care of him!
Forgive me, for I'm very confused.
but if you take care of him, I'll do whatever is right.
But this not knowing, I cannot endure it.
Pablo, I got me a ... a tank!
One.
Two.
Three.
Four!
Now take the wire back as far as it will reach ... before I connect it.
Roberto!
Hurry, Roberto!
Hurry!
Blow it, Anselmo!
No, I can't!
You'll be ...
Pull it, I tell you!
No, Roberto!
María!
María!
Your Inglés is alright.
Hear me?
He's alright.
Yes, thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Roberto!
The old one?
Dead.
We lost Fernando.
If I only had the exploder, he would be alive.
What's with Pablo?
Maybe he can't leave.
Then let us leave!
The devil with him!
Wait! He'll be back if he's able.
Machine gun.
Here comes the ...
Plenty of horses now, Inglés!
Where's Fernando?
And the old man?
Where are the three men of Elias?
What were you shooting in the gorge?
Why don't you say you shot them?
Shut up!
Answer me!
I look after my own people.
And the men of Elias?
They were not our people.
I provide horses for my people! - We have horses to spare.
Yeah?
How did I know we would have three killed?
Now, shut up!
I lead the retreat.
Don't be stubborn, woman.
Watch the María.
Look!
There they are!
Wait for the next shot, then go hard before they can reload.
Now!
No!
Roberto!
Roberto!
Let me go!
Roberto!
What is it? Is it ...
It's broken.
Can you ride?
Get me a strip of canvas. Tear it from one of the packs.
Get me the machine gun.
You can make it if I hold 'em here.
No, Inglés. We'll carry you. Don't argue.
I can't ride.
I couldn't even sit on a horse. I'd ...
I'd pass out.
Pablo know I'm right.
I want to talk to María alone.
But when I tell you to take her, do it.
Talk fast, Inglés. The soldiers will soon be coming.
María, listen, don't say anything.
We won't be going to America this time.
But always I go with you wherever you go. Understand?
You go now, María.
No, I stay with you, Roberto.
No, María.
What I do now, I do alone. - No.
If you go, then I go too. Whichever one there is, is both.
No.
No, I stay with you.
No, each of us must do this thing alone.
Do it for each other.
But if you go, then I go with you.
I know you'll go now, María, for both of us, because we love each other always. That way I go too.
It's easier for me to stay with you, Roberto.
I know it's harder for you.
But now I am you also.
If you go, I go too.
That's the only way I can go.
You're me now. Surely you must feel that, María.
Remember last night?
Our time is "now" and it'll never end. - No.
You're me now and I am you.
Now you understand. Now you're going.
You're going well and fast and far.
We'll go to America another time, María.
Stand up now and go.
And we both go.
Stand up.
Remember, you're me too.
You're all there will be ever be of me now. Stand up.
No.
Stand up.
There's no goodbye, María, because we're not apart.
Pilar!
Don't turn around.
Go now. Be strong.
Take care of our life.
No, Pilar, I can't go!
No!
Oh Roberto!
Roberto, let me stay, please!
Please don't make me go!
No, Roberto, no!
God, that was lucky I could make her go.
I don't mind this at all now.
They're away.
Think how it would be if they'd got María instead of you.
Don't pass out, Jordan.
Think about America.
I can't.
Think about Madrid.
I can't.
Think about María.
I can do that. Alright.
No, you fool!
You weren't kidding María about that talk of "now"!
Now they can't stop us, ever!
She's going on with me! Right!
Goddard's just arrived, Spud.
What's the ruddy idea?
It's total war, isn't it? What do you want?
Message from HQ. Where's the CO?
In the barn.
Message from headquarters, sir.
Sergeant Hawkins?
Sir.
Read it.
Sir.
It's in code, sir. Message begins:
Exercise invasion of the London area by Regular Army.
Home Guard defending.
War starts at midnight."
Message ends.
The CO's put in pencil here, sir, "Make it like the real thing."
Oh, he has, has he?
Section commanders.
Message from HQ.
War starts at midnight. You have your orders.
Tell the men. - Tell them to make it like the real thing.
What do you mean by the real thing?
Divide our losses by 10 and multiply the enemy's by 20.
Yes, sir.
That's all for now.
Anything for me, sir?
No, no, nothing else.
War starts at midnight. We know...
They know... - We attack...
They counterattack.
Like the real thing, my Aunt Fanny!
Like the real thing...
Like the real thing!
Sergeant Hawkins, section commanders!
So, war starts at midnight, does it?
Sir.
We attack at six.
Take the Tommy guns and three trucks.
Section leaders with Tommy guns. Arm the men with bombs, rifles, bayonets. - Tommy.
Sir.
From your section
Rice, Unsworth, the two Owens,
Nobby, Toots and Cochran.
Not Cochran.
Stuffy, who are the biggest toughs in your lot?
Bill Wall, Wimpey, Popeye.
Right.
Yours, Robin?
Frank, Skeets, Duggie Stuart, sir.
Taffy, Geordie, sir.
Busty, Simms and Pat Sullivan, sir.
Dai Evans - we must have him, look you.
All right, get going.
Excuse me, sir?
Did you say that we attack before war is declared?
Yes, like Pearl Harbor. Now, get going.
By the way, there's just one stop - at The Bull.
I've got a date there with Mata Hari.
Careless talk? - Yeah.
Now, scram.
Five minutes easy, Sergeant.
Five minutes easy, Stuffy.
I wonder what's keeping Spud.
Come on.
Afternoon, Sergeant Hawkins.
Afternoon, miss.
Back on the trucks.
Spud?
There's Spud.
Spud?
What's the matter?
What's the matter?
Spud!
She got me. - Who?
Mata Hari!
Come on, quick...
Any luck? - Not a hope.
She's halfway to London by now.
She's gone to warn the wizard.
Come on, get my tin hat.
Come on!
The barricade's open, sir.
God damn it!
You know, you ought to have one of these field dressings on that.
Save it for her. She'll need it somewhere else when I catch up with her.
See that barricade, my boys?
At midnight on the dot, it's got to be closed, and, of course, the enemy can't get through before, because why?
War starts at midnight!
What's the objective, sir?
Royal Bathers' Club.
What about Mata Hari?
We'll beat her to it. I know a couple of short cuts after Marble Arch.
There she is!
Get the other trucks to close up.
See if you can pass her.
Blast that taxi!
Steady.
Keep right on his tail.
Keep straight on.
Second left.
We've got her!
Come on, Section.
Number two?
Number three?
You have your orders.
Sergeant Hawkins. - Sir.
Yes, I...
Is General Wynne-Candy here?
He left an hour ago with Brigadier General Caldicott and Air Vice Marshal Lloyd-Hughes.
Did he say where he was going?
What is your business with him?
I have an urgent message.
If you give me the message, I'll see he gets it.
Damn it all, man!
Are you in the Home Guard?
Why, sir?
The password is Veuve Clicquot 1911.
The General and his staff are in the Turkish baths, sir.
Sergeant Hawkins? You're in charge. Stay with him.
And you're a prisoner of war.
It doesn't start till midnight.
That's what you think.
That girl under the desk, she's a prisoner too. - Sir.
All right, boys, this is it.
Brute force and ruddy ignorance!
Come on. After him! Double up.
You're a prisoner.
Guard this man.
And answer that damn telephone! Yes?
Yes, miss?
Warn General Wynne-Candy?
Can't do that, miss.
Sorry, miss. The General's a prisoner, and so are you.
Oh!
The war's over.
Quiet!
Are you the ringleader of this outrage?
Quiet, please!
This is an Army exercise. You're all prisoners.
Now, stay where you are. - Come here.
Where's General Wynne-Candy?
Who, sir? - You heard.
In the steam room.
Come on, then, show me the way.
This is it.
Sir?
Sir?
Go away.
General Wynne-Candy?
Eh?
What? Who is it?
Lieutenant Wilson, 2nd Battalion, the Loamshires, sir.
What do you want?
Well, sir...
I'm afraid, sir, we've...
Well, say it, man, say it. I've no time to waste. Oh, yes, you have, sir.
I beg your pardon, sir?
You've got all night, sir.
Attendant!
I'm afraid he can't come.
Why?
He's a prisoner, sir.
What's going on here? Invasion, sir.
But, you damned young idiot, war starts at midnight.
Haventyou been told? - Oh, yes, sir.
That's why we're here.
But may I ask on what authority?
On the authority of these guns and these men.
Authority? !
Authority? !
How dare you, sir!
How dare you!
Get out of here, sir, you and your gang of awful militia gangsters.
Popeye. Guard this man. Stuffy?
Sir? Go to the cubicles.
Find the General's. You'll find a pigskin case there.
Yes, sir.
But you can't do that!
Look, the code is in that case. The whole exercise'll be a farce - ifyou have that code.
Oh, no, sir.
This is going to be the real thing.
But war starts at midnight!
Oh, yes, you say war starts at midnight.
How do you know the enemy says so too?
But, my dear fellow, that was agreed, wasn't it?
Agreed, my foot!
How many agreements have been kept by the enemy since war began?
We agree to keep to the rules, and they go on kicking us in the pants.
When I joined the Army, the only agreement I made was to defend my country, not only by the National Sporting Club rules, but by every means that have existed
since Cain slugged Abel.
Stop it.
They're counting on us to keep to the rules.
They openly boast about it!
Stop it!
Lieutenant... ..Watson, or whatever your name is, you are not in Hyde Park, with an audience of loafers.
I am Major General Wynne-Candy.
These other gentlemen have all seen service.
Distinguished service with the British Army.
When Napoleon said that an army marches on its stomach...
I'd better stop, sir.
You're an extremely impudent young officer, but let me tell you that in 40 years' time you will be an old gentleman too.
If your belly keeps pace with your head, you'll have a bigger one than any of us.
Maybe I shall in 40 years, but I doubt it, and I doubt if I'll have time to grow a moustache like yours, sir.
But in 1983, at least I shall be able to say that 40 years ago I was a fellow of enterprise.
I'll punch your head for that, young fellow! You young puppy!
Put 'em up.
Take that. I'll teach you!
Think you can say what you like to an old 'un, do you?
Do you know how many wars I've been in?
I was fighting for my country when your father was still in bumfreezers!
Puppy! Gangster!
You laugh at my big belly, but you don't know how I got it.
You laugh at my moustache, but you don't know why I grew it.
How do you know what sort of a fellow I was when I was as young as you 40 years ago?
40 years ago.
Everything you want, Mr Candy, sir?
Quiet! Quiet!
People are trying to sleep.
Suggie!
Hoppy, my old horse! - Since when are you in London?
Yesterday.
Sick leave.
I say, I've been searching for you all over the city.
Yes?
I'm terribly sorry to hear about your leg.
Jumping Jehoshaphat! It is there! - What did you think I was standing on?
I thought you had a wooden leg.
Why should I have a wooden leg?
They told me they cut off your left leg. Can't have, old boy.
I'd have known about it.
Quiet!
Call a cab, porter. - Yes, sir.
Boy.
A hansom. Growlers barred. - He knows, sir.
I could have done with a nap myself.
I'm going to the theatre tonight.
Can't you sleep there?
Lnvited. Two ladies.
Can I come?
One is the mother.
Your cab, sir.
The opera singers, eh? Hm.
No wonder civilians are grumbling about the Army.
Ought to be ashamed of yourselves, yelling and screaming like some damned...
It's a nice state of things.
Officers and men losing their lives in South Africa, while young officers are roaring about public places like drunkards.
Perhaps you are drunk, hm?
What's this?
The VC, sir.
Where did you get it?
South Africa. Jordaan Siding.
You're Candy. "Sugar" Candy!
Yes, sir.
Good show, Candy.
Thank you, sir.
Hopwell, sir.
Hopwell?
Son of Barney Hopwell of the 66th? - Yes, sir.
You're very musical.
No, sir. - And so are you.
You mean, Mignon, sir? "I Am Titania"?
You're what?
Titania.
We were shut up with her for seven months near Jordaan Siding.
I beg your pardon?
It's an aria, sir. Mignon.
We had a phonograph and broke every record but that one. We know it by heart.
Well, are you boys going to Piccadilly?
That's where I'm going.
Can I give you a lift?
No, thank you, sir. We've got a cab.
St James's Palace.
Right, sir.
I hope you two boys enjoy your leave. You've earned it.
Thank you, sir. Mind the door, sir.
Boy!
Another hansom.
The old horse thief.
Have you ever ridden in one?
Rather.
All the way to Epsom.
Lovely lines, hasn't she? - Topping.
A hot potato, sir?
We've just come over for a warm.
The same beastly drizzle. The same fog and soot.
Good old London.
Now, listen, Suggie. You remember that interview you gave The Times?
You don't mean to say you read it?
Me? No.
But I have a niece who has a governess who has a sister.
Pretty?
Never laid eyes on her, but she read it.
Who?
My niece's governess's sister. In Berlin.
She wrote to her sister over here who gave the letter to my niece to give to me to give to you.
Who do I give it to?
Nobody. It's for you, and there it is.
Well, read it, you big ape.
You'll find out.
It's interesting.
Sit down.
Thank you, sir.
Fire away.
Well, sir, I have a friend...
Good.
Not everyone can say that. Continue.
This friend of mine, sir, has a niece.
Cut it short. You say here something about a letter.
Who wrote it? Two: What's in it?
Three: What's the War Office got to do with it?
Four:
I'll tell you. Five:
Out.
One?
A girl wrote it from Berlin, sir. Edith Hunter.
She's a governess there.
Rather an uncomfortable billet just now.
That's just it. They hate us in Germany.
They're spreading propaganda all over Europe that we're killing women and children in South Africa, starving them in camps, shooting mothers, burning babies.
You wouldnt believe what they've invented.
Conan Doyle thinks something ought to be done about it, too.
About what?
And what's all this about a letter?
And who's Conan Doyle? The author chap.
Writes the Sherlock Holmes stories in The Strand.
This Doyle writes the Sherlock Holmes stories?
Yes, sir. - Conan Doyle.
Never heard of him, but I've read every Holmes story since they started in July '91.
Reading The Hound Of The Baskervilles?
That last instalment.
A bit of a facer for poor old Watson, sir.
Lovely evening, my dear Watson. I really think you'll be more comfortable outside than in.'
Sarcastic devil, that fellow Holmes.
I once had a CO just like him.
He must be a rather good fellow as authors go.
He is collecting material about our campaign in South Africa to counter German propaganda.
The Times printed an interview with me about seven weeks ago. Bad.
A good rule to keep out of the newspapers.
Still, The Times is a bit different.
Yes, I suppose so.
In this interview, I mentioned a place called Jordaan Siding.
I was there for seven months.
This girl writes that the worst stories of all are being put about by a fellow called Kaunitz, who says he saw with his own eyes
British soldiers kill 250 women and children at Jordaan Siding in order to save feeding them.
Do you know this fellow... Kaunitz? - Of course, sir.
He's the most awful little rat.
He was spying for us and the Boers.
He made South Africa too hot for himself and skipped.
Both sides would have shot him, if they could.
What do you want me to do?
My leave isn't up for four weeks.
Why shouldn't I go to Berlin and confront this rat?
My dear boy.
First of all, it's not done.
This isn't Army business, it's Embassy.
Leave politics to the politicians.
You wouldn't like a diplomat to come charging into the front line.
It might do him a lot of good, sir.
Juvenile nonsense.
Sorry, sir.
You were sent home in order to recuperate.
Your country needs you.
Do you play golf?
Yes, sir.
What's your form?
About ten, sir.
Sorry, sir.
I'm invited by Lady Gilpin to Leicestershire.
Enjoy yourself.
Ml. Major Plumley.
This author chap...
Author chap, sir?
Fellow that wrote Hound Of The Baskervilles.
Conan Doyle?
Yes.
You didn't happen to ask him - what happens in the next instalment?
Just a moment.
Yes, sir.
There's another murder. - Not the baronet?
No, sir.
The baronet's safe. Good.
Good. I'm glad.
Warm for January.
Damn cold, I call it.
Take my tip, my boy. You've got a damn good VC, now keep quiet for a bit, hm?
Well, what did he say?
Do you still want to go to the theatre tonight?
You told me when I asked you...
Never mind what I said. Her Majesty's Theatre.
The Last Of The Dandies.
Introduce yourself to Lady Gilpin and Sybil.
Say I've gone on some secret mission. Make me mysterious. Girl's pretty.
Mother's a gorgon.
Are you going on a secret mission?
Yes, to Berlin. - He send you?
It's a secret from him, too.
You send those flowers?
Yes, sir.
Oh, there's a postcard for you, sir.
It's from Mr Candy.
So, the old boy got there.
How is Mr Candy, sir?
Read it yourself.
Mr Candy?
Miss Hunter?
Yes.
Thank you for your telegram.
It was a great surprise.
I had no idea you were in Berlin.
Nor had I until now.
I only arrived yesterday.
Can you possibly mean that you've come here solely on account of my letter?
Well, naturally.
You don't mind, do you?
No, no, of course not.
Well... shall we sit down?
Did you have a good journey? - Excellent.
I'm sorry to bring you out.
I was about to call on you.
I've changed my address.
My position became intolerable.
I've had to leave.
English people are not very popular in Berlin.
You've lost your job because you're English?
Can you get another job?
Perhaps in a few months' time.
What will you do now?
Go back.
To England?
Yes, I'm afraid so. Cheer up.
England isn't as bad as all that, you know.
That is what we both want to prove, isn't it, Mr Candy?
Yes, Miss Hunter.
How shall we begin?
Do you know what Kaunitz looks like?
No, I've never seen him.
I know a cafe where he holds his Stammtisch - a table regularly reserved for him...
Do you know any of his friends, Miss Hunter?
Yes, one. A student.
The brother of my... ex-employer. He is a Burschenschafter.
You know what Burschenshafts are?
No, Miss Hunter.
Groups of students with political principles.
They assert them by drinking beer and fighting duels.
Duelling is very popular here, I believe.
Oh, yes.
It's a proud father that has a scarred son, and vice versa.
German girls find scars very attractive.
A book was recently published on the German colonies, in which it was specifically stated that one advantage of possessing duelling scars was that native Africans look with more respect upon white men who bear them.
I feel like Stanley and Livingstone!
Surely not both, Mr Candy? - No.
Miss Livingstone and the missionary.
Livingstone was the missionary.
Oh, yes, of course. So he was.
Well, about this cafe, can you take me there this evening?
Do you wish me to accompany you?
Very well.
It's awfully nice of you.
I should obviously be absolutely lost without you.
Then, Mr Candy, you are Livingstone, I presume?
Mr Candy?
Oh, it's a song all the rage just now.
Die Mühle ging rund und rund".
The Mill Went Round And Round", Mr Candy.
Miss Hunter, I'm afraid I've met you here under false pretences.
Indeed?
Why?
There are political complications.
The Prince ofWales is coming to Berlin.
He's invited to the Kaiser's birthday party.
A goodwill visit and all that sort of thing.
I know. It was in the papers.
You see, Miss Hunter, I know a chap at our Embassy here. We were at school together.
His name's Fitzroy.
Only, we used to call him "Baby-Face".
But how are the Prince of Wales and your friend "Baby-Face" connected?
Well, you see... ..he nearly had a fit when he knew why I'd come.
Baby-Face, I mean.
He lugged me in to see the Second Secretary and he nearly had a fit too. The possible scandal, you know.
Are you coming to a point, Mr Candy?
Yes, the point is that I had to promise to do nothing.
And I went bail for you, too.
Apparently, it's a matter for careful... careful diplomacy.
You can see what they mean.
Yes, of course.
I know nothing about politics.
I rather stuck my head in where I wasn't wanted.
I could get into the most awful trouble.
Trouble, Mr Candy?
Well, I'm a soldier. You know that.
I thought you were a soldier this morning.
Or have you joined the Army since luncheon?
The table's filling up. - Whose table?
Don't you remember the Stammtisch?
It's where Kaunitz will sit.
You know, it's a bit staggering to see a girl take such an interest in politics.
Politics?
Well, what else can you call it?
German propaganda against England. Counter-propaganda.
That's politics, isn't it?
Not for me, nor for a great many people.
You see, Mr Candy, when our Embassy in Berlin reports to the Foreign Office in London that "a slight change of attitude is visible in the German nationals towards the Boer question",
I have to report home that I have lost my position and am returning to the bosom of my family.
I suppose they'd be rather sick about it.
They will welcome me with open arms.
I don't blame them, either.
No, you see, my family were opposed to my coming to Berlin.
They said the place for a young girl is home. - Quite so.
Why?
What do you mean, why?
How do you know what is the best place for a young girl?
Are you a girl?
Have you any daughters?
I say!
While you men have been fighting, we women have been thinking.
Think for yourself, Mr Candy.
What careers are there open to a woman?
She can get married. - I was just going to say...
Supposing she doesn't want to get married?
She can go and be a governess.
But what does a governess know, Mr Candy?
Nothing, I assure you.
Then what can she teach the children in her charge?
Very little, except good manners, if she herself has good manners.
Good manners are important.
Did you learn that in South Africa?
My brothers told me that good manners cost us Magerfontein, Stormberg and Colenso.
6,000 men killed and 20,000 wounded and two years of war, when with a little common sense and bad manners, there would have been no war at all.
The one thing I don't understand is why you should have to teach German children manners.
There are plenty of English...
I'll tell you, if you promise not to laugh. - I promise.
My only asset is a fluent command of English.
Hear, hear!
To teach English in England is to carry coals to Newcastle, and it's ill-paid.
I decided to obtain a post in Germany, where my English would command a premium, and, having learnt German, to return to England...
Well, I'll be sugared!
It's him, all right, the little skunk.
Well, shall we go? - Go?
Oh, yes, I suppose so.
History will remember this as the great retreat from the Cafe Hohenzollern.
Just a second, please.
Can you get the orchestra to play 141? Why, yes, of course.
Call a waiter.
It's Mignon, "I Am Titania".
Do you really like it?
I'll explain later.
Herr Ober!
Kaunitz was a prisoner in our blockhouse. This was the only record we had on our phonograph.
I want to see if he remembers it.
Touched him on the raw, all right.
He's calling the waiter.
Herr Ober!
Is he trying to bribe the orchestra?
Not with money. Beer.
Round one to Kaunitz.
Reinforcements are coming.
He's coming up.
Let us go, Mr Candy. - A bit late now.
I hope he doesn't see you.
I hope he does.
Hello, Kaunitz.
Come on, Kaunitz. You speak English. - I do.
But I prefer German. Meine Damen und Herren!
Stop it, Kaunitz. I'm with a lady.
You should have thought of that earlier.
Stop it, Kaunitz. - Take off your...
Come on. Be a good lad.
Get back to your table.
Please tell him that it's all his fault.
He started it. - Englander!
Manners!
Ich spreche Englisch.
You will get into great trouble.
You are not now in England.
You saw very well that he asked for it.
Herr Kaunitz is a friend of ours.
Please stop shouting.
You don't understand.
This gentleman and Herr Kaunitz are old friends.
It's going a bit far to call that skunk a friend of mine.
Herr Kaunitz is a member of der Alldeutsche Verband!
The Alldeutsche Verband ought to be ashamed of itself.
Mein Herr, officers of the lmperial German Army are members of das Alldeutsche Verband.
Then the officers of the lmperial German Army ought to be ashamed of themselves, too.
Guten Tag.
Being on British territory, shouldn't we speak in English? Righto.
How can I help you gentlemen?
Won't you sit down?
Thank you.
Thank you.
We wish some information about a compatriot of yours in Berlin, a certain Mr Candy.
Clive Candy? - Yes, Clive Candy.
You've come to the right man.
We were at Harrow together.
We've lost touch a bit since the war.
He's Army, you know. - An officer of the British Army?
Just returned from South Africa.
You have relieved us from great doubts.
We were worried he might not be able to give satisfaction.
Satisfaction?
An officer of the lmperial German Army cannot demand satisfaction from an opponent who is not his equal in position and honour.
Since this Clive Candy is an officer, - he can be challenged. - Challenged to what?
To a duel, Mr Fitzroy.
Hurry to the Kaiserhof. Bring Mr Clive Candy here at once.
Don't come back without him.
I told you to hurry, Venning! Don't argue.
Go at once!
Mr Candy has insulted the whole of the German Army. I didn't, sir.
I only said if the officers belonged to the Alldeutscher Verband with Kaunitz... then the German Army ought to be ashamed of itself.
That's what you said.
82 Ulan officers want to challenge you.
Mr Candy's told me the whole story.
By the way, that girl you mentioned, is she trustworthy?
Oh, undoubtedly, sir.
It's not suggested Mr Candy should fight the whole officer corps?
They're drawing lots to decide who is to fight this gentleman... who has not insulted anybody.
Have you any suggestions, Colonel?
Militarily speaking, Mr Candy has no option.
If he cannot fight a duel, he must run away.
Politically speaking, such an action would be disastrous.
Mr Candy must fight. One moment.
Surely you're leaving Mr Candy out of your calculations.
I'll fight if necessary, sir.
Yes, my dear boy. I know that.
You'd better go to your hotel and stay there.
Yes, sir.
Could you get in touch with Miss er... Miss Hunter, sir?
I believe I could.
Tell her to give the impression that your reasons for coming to Berlin were to see her.
You're in love with her or something of the sort. - But I'm not.
Mr Candy, you've caused enough trouble already.
Do what I ask.
Meanwhile, I and these gentlemen will discuss the best way to get you out of this.
And us.
Well, you are a...
May I have the Codex?
Thank you.
This is our famous Brown Codex, Colonel Goodhead.
The code of honour observed by all duellists.
We thought you might not be familiar with it. Thank you.
I shall study it with attention.
We have permission to offer for the site of the duel the gymnasium at the barracks of our regiment.
We agree.
We are now in the position to announce who will fight Lieutenant Candy.
Oberleutnant Theodor Kretschmar-Schuldorff.
May I make a note of that? - With pleasure.
His card.
Thank you.
Have you any suggestions regarding choice of leader for the duel?
We suggest the military attache to the Swedish legation.
His name is...?
Colonel Borg.
Colonel Borg.
Regarding sabres, we shall, of course, supply a number to choose from.
We shall supply a number, as well. - Certainly, Colonel.
The choice of sabres will be determined by lot.
You know, of course, that sabres must not exceed the maximum weight of 60 decagrams?
We shall make a note of it.
Bring your own doctor. We shall bring ours. - We agree.
Do you prefer to strip the upper parts of the bodies of the combatants,
or do you prefer shirtsleeves? - Shirtsleeves.
I see here that paragraph 133 says, "A few hours previous to the duel it is advisable to take a bath.'
Only the principals, not the seconds!
It's very strange to be preparing a duel between two people who've never even seen each other.
It happens sometimes.
Marriages also, you know?
Has your man ever fought a duel? No.
Has yours?
Strictly between ourselves, Theo doesn't really approve of duels.
Then, gentlemen, is this fight really necessary?
Sir, there are moments in a soldier's life when his personal feelings do not count.
Oberleutnant Kretschmar-Schuldorff knows his duties very well.
We have not agreed upon the time.
Will seven in the morning be agreeable to you?
Get it over early.
I agree.
Seven o'clock.
Lt'd be advisable to meet half an hour earlier.
At 6:30 a.m. in the gymnasium of the barracks of the 2nd Ulans.
Ah, here comes our man.
Slept well? - Very.
He was still sleeping when I called.
They forgot to wake me. - Your nerves are all right.
Dr Crowther.
Mr Candy. - How do you do?
How do you do?
Oh.
Why wasn't I allowed any breakfast? - Because the book says not.
It would.
Ah, you'll do.
Do you want this?
I hope you've read it. Miss Hunter read it.
She says it's a joke, good enough for Punch.
Where is Theo Kretschmar-Schuldorff?
He hasn't shown up yet.
I congratulate you on your pronunciation.
I learnt it by heart, so when my grandchildren say,
Grandpa, have you ever cut anybody's ear off?"
I shall be able to say, "Yes, Theo Kretschmar-Schuldorrfs."
Nobody could invent a name like that.
Hello, who's this?
Colonel Borg, the Swedish military attache.
He's going to lead the combat.
Colonel Borg. Mr Candy.
I must, of course, use German expressions.
I shall say "los" for starting and "halt" for stop.
Can you memorise these two words?
I'll try.
At the beginning, I'll be sure you mean "start".
During the combat, you're not likely to say "start" again.
That is true.
Excuse me.
Theo Kretschmar-Schuldorff will forfeit his entrance fee if he doesn't...
I wish I'd brought my uniform. - How are you with a sabre?
Oh, I don't know.
I know which end to hold. - We drew lots for them.
I hope mine's a nice light one.
All sabres weigh the same.
Seconds, please?
Excuse me, please, would you undo your shirt?
Thank you.
Right.
Do you want to roll up your sleeve or will you rip it off? - What's better?
I am not permitted to give advice.
I think I'll rip it.
It is definitely better.
Doctor, your scissors, please.
What did he hope to find in there?
Protective bandages.
Good luck, my boy.
Now, you alone will come with me, please.
You'd better rub your feet in the rosin.
Ich werde jetzt das Protokol vorlesen. I shall read now the protocol.
You will start only at the command "los".
You must stop the combat ifyou hear the command 'halt', whoever may say it.
If you feel to be wounded, you must stop the combat, and by leaping back, you must regain position at the original distance, even if no 'halt' has been commanded.
It is forbidden to seize the weapon of the opponent with the bare hand.
Into fighting position, please.
Los!
They must have started by now. - You never know.
I heard of one chap whose nerve broke.
Absolutely went all to pieces. - Poor fellow.
He was in such a funk, he couldn't lift his arm.
The seconds tried to lift it for him, but as soon as they let go, it dropped like a railroad signal.
I say, I hope our chap doesn't get killed.
It'll create an awful stink if he does.
I think you are the most odious man I have ever met.
If anything does happen to him, I'll blow up your Embassy. - I say.
Never mind. If anything happens to Mr Candy...
Oh, you mean Suggie.
I was talking about the German fellow.
Nothing could possibly happen to Suggie. He won the fencing shield
two years running.
Do you know... - Oh, look!
Afternoon, Miss Hunter. - Good afternoon.
You can go in now.
How is he?
The doctors say six to eight weeks, not longer.
Fit as a fiddle. - I'm so glad.
They've given permission for you to stay here.
I'm not staying in Germany, Colonel Goodhead. I go back tomorrow.
I've already telegraphed my father.
Haven't you told her?
No.
Now, Miss Hunter, you must be sensible.
We're very fortunate that everything has gone off so well.
You wouldn't want to spoil everything.
Spoil everything?
The duel was generally supposed to be about you.
What would people say if you left him now, wounded and alone in a nursing home?
Naturally, I thought you understood all this, otherwise why have you come here?
To say goodbye to Mr Candy.
Go in now, Miss Hunter.
Don't bother about the bills.
They have orders to send those to the Embassy.
Good afternoon.
Good afternoon.
Good afternoon, Miss Hunter.
Well.
Good afternoon, Miss Hunter. You are Miss Hunter, are you not?
My name is Erna Konig, and I speak excellent English.
Oh, that's splendid.
How is he? - He can neither hear nor speak.
It will be very difficult for a day or two until we take the bandages off.
He has a fine cut. His upper lip is very nearly severed. It is really almost 10 cm in length.
A knife could not have done it better.
Is he in great pain?
Oh, but certainly.
He is a very lucky man not to have glass splinters in the wound.
It is a common accident in winter.
The snow freezes on the boot, the warm room melts the ice, and the little piece of slippery ice lies in wait for the hurrying foot...
But to fall right through the glass window of the British ambassador, that is not so common.
No, indeed.
And would you believe it?
We have another accident, in the next wing.
An officer.
He is cut to the forehead. 12 stitches. - Quite a coincidence.
I go now to prepare your room.
You are staying here, don't you?
Yes, Nurse Erna, I do.
If you wish to speak to him, please to shout.
I have got you into an awful mess.
Awful mess!
You've got me into a mess, too.
I forgive you.
Do you want me to write to your people in England? Parents?
Brother?
Sister?
Fiancee?
Oh, you want your wallet.
What's the address?
Your aunt seems to like short letters.
What shall I tell her? The truth?
Accident.
Hunting accident!
Do you know Oberleutnant Kretschmar-Schuldorff is here?
He has a very bad cut on his forehead.
Eight stitches.
Oh, he has 12 stitches.
Here is refreshment, Miss Hunter,
then you must depart for today.
When can he have visitors?
Wednesday is visitors' day.
Every Wednesday?
Every Wednesday from 3 p.m. to 5 p.m.
At 5 p.m., a bell is rung for the end of visitors' hours.
What did he say, Aubrey?
I think he wants us to go first, sir.
We can't do that, can we? Er, you and I, you know, together.
Engländer.
I had thought that no-one could smoke so much as a German officer.
Now I see that a British officer can surpass him.
And not only in smoking, my dear Nurse Erna.
And in what else, also?
Eating, drinking, making love, growing moustaches.
Miss Hunter, I am going to grow a moustache.
What is your opinion?
Excellent.
Our dragoons gave you the idea.
You always find me out.
I saw them cross the vestibule, preceded by their moustaches.
They nearly caused a diplomatic incident.
They collided with a party of Ulans coming from...
My dear Miss Hunter, soldiers cause military incidents.
They leave diplomacy to the diplomats.
A German officer would shave off his moustache to show that he had a scar.
That's just one of the points where we differ, my dear Nurse Erna.
Will you like me with a moustache?
How do you know you can grow one?
Nurse Erna, Nurse Erna, is it permissible to insult the patients?
What view, if any, do you take of my great moustache plan?
You are the moustache type.
Thank you.
She's taken away... Always tidying up.
Nurse Erna, where are my...
Thank you.
Is the British Army enjoying itself in Berlin?
On the whole, yes.
They had lunch yesterday in the regimental mess of the 1st Dragoon Guards.
The Kaiser and the Prince ofWales spoke.
Spoke about what?
Nobody could remember.
When do they return to London?
In a week. Would you care to accompany them?
They'll have a special train.
We could try, or you could stay another five weeks and come back with me.
Great care must be taken of me.
No doubt.
No answer at all.
Will you or wont you?
If you stay on, you may get another job.
Oh, are we going to play cards?
I asked Nurse Erna to fix up a bridge four. We don't want to get bored.
The head nurse is finding a suitable couple for you to play with after dinner, but you must not stay up after 10:30 at the very latest.
I promise you, Nurse Erna.
You do play?
Only whist.
Oh, it's simple. - Let's have a trial game of double dummy.
I will bring a lamp.
You're a good pupil, Edith.
That's $32,000 I owe you.
Toss you,
double or quits.
Well, what is it?
Heads.
Heads it is. Ha! We're quits.
Cigarettes, but please do remember, Mr Candy, that smoking is bad for you.
Lch liebe Sie, Nurse Erna.
You are an angel, Nurse Erna.
There are our guests.
Miss Hunter. Mr Candy.
How do you do?
Kretschmar-Schuldorff.
I'm very glad you've come.
I promised Theo to make a little speech.
He would like to have made it himself.
Very much.
Theo knows only two English expressions -
very much" and "not very much".
Very much.
He would like to have come before.
Very much.
Only he was afraid nobody could translate to you what he says.
Miss Hunter speaks German.
She sprechen German.
Theo has heard that you took part in the South Africa campaign.
Ja, ja. - And that you have won a very famous medal.
Viktoria...
Victoria Cross.
Ja. Cross.
He envies you because a German officer knows about war
And mostly wrongly.
And mostly wrongly.
Let's have a drink, shall we? Sherry?
I would love a glass of sherry.
Would you like sherry?
Not very much.
Port?
Was nehmen Sie, Fräulein? She and I, we drink Kirschwater.
Yes, that's right. Kirschwater. Do you like it?
Very, very much.
Let me help you.
Do you know Berlin, Mr Candy?
The Hotel Kaiserhof, the British Embassy, the Cafe Hohenzollern, and the gymnasium of the barracks of the 2nd Ulans.
I hope we shall be able to show you more than that.
Danke sehr. Do you like the opera? Concerts?
I prefer riding, hunting or polo.
I adore hunting, and I love sports.
Nein, ich habe keinerlei Talent für Sport. Cut for partners.
You and I.
Ich hoffe, wir spielen jeden Abend. - What's he saying?
I hope we shall be able to play every night.
Oh, yes, rather!
Very much.
I say.
Oh, Baby-Face, I want you a moment.
What is it? Those nursing home accounts?
Yes.
Would you kindly explain what the deuce this item means?
40 packs of playing cards!
It's enough for the casino at Monte Carlo.
I spoke to Miss Hunter about it. The evenings were so long, there's nothing to do at Stolpchensee. Very well.
Don't you ever do any work?
Oh, this.
First time this year.
After all, it's mild.
Well, don't catch a cold. These nursing homes are an expensive business.
Is Miss Hunter returning to England? - As far as I know.
Well, not at our expense, I hope.
Good heavens, no. She was going anyway.
Well, so was Candy, for that matter. I know.
He had a return ticket.
It's expired.
Very well, buy him a new one. - Righto.
And get Candy to give you that old ticket of his.
We'll claim a refund at Cook's.
Half a mo, those things belong to Theo.
Put them with the alarm clock.
How's your own packing going? - Not fast.
Well, you'd better hurry up, then.
I'll be all right.
Dontyou be so sure.
We've only got half an hour and we've got to call at the Embassy first.
Stop mooning about.
I'm not mooning about!
Keep your hair on.
I say, old girl, what's up?
Edith, I say, what's the matter?
It's not because I didn't call for you yesterday, is it?
Frau von Kalteneck left for the south last night. - Did she?
You knew she was going.
I'd forgotten.
It's not my fault if you don't like horses, is it?
We went to see her riding stables. She's got some fine beasts.
They're a bit fat, though.
I say, old girl, do stop crying. Suppose somebody came in.
Nobody will come in. - Look...
I promise to take you out the first night we get back to London.
Her Majesty's Theatre, The Last Of The Dandies.
They say it's an awfully good show. - The paper said...
What paper? What do you mean?
Is that what's making you cry?
No, the paper said there was a play at Her Majesty's called Ulysses.
Oberleutnant Kretschmar-Schuldorff returns your books, Mr Candy.
He is on his way to see you.
Oh, I must hurry. You'd better.
I'll meet you in the hall.
Well, what am I to do with them? I don't read German.
Miss Hunter got them for me.
You can present them to our library.
Clever Nurse Erna, but I must write my name in them... so Clive Candy's name will live for ever in a corner at Stolpchensee.
May I come in?
Come in, my old horse, my old steeplechaser.
Wo ist Edith?
Packing.
Wieso packing?
Wieso packing?
Of course. Und Sie?
How much longer Sie?
Oh, ich eine week, oder...
Two weeks?
Two week.
Clive, Edith come here translate. - I can translate.
Nein, danke.
Don't interrupt Edith. She'll never be ready.
Shall I fetch Miss Hunter?
Ich mussen call at Embassy, old man, get my ticket nach London.
Drink? - Nein.
Not now.
All right.
What the blazes is up with everybody today?
Clive... you... und I... friends, yes?
Or no?
Well, of course we're friends.
We must... ..duel again.
Where's your dictionary, old man? You must have got two pages stuck together.
Iove... ..your...
Your... Miss Hunter.
Say that again.
I... love... your... Miss Hunter.
You're cuckoo. No... nein.
Ich...
Ich nein cuckoo.
You cuckoo... because Miss Hunter... loves me.
Congratulations! When did it happen?
Why don't I know about it?
No duel? - Duel?
I?
Ich fight anyone who tried to stop it. - Now will you have a drink?
Double drink!
You know, old boy, Edith was never my fiancee.
Das ist das Wort, das ich nicht finden kann. No, not my fiancee.
Lovely girl. Sweet girl. But not my fiancee.
Cheers.
Bottom up.
Come in.
Ah, Nurse Erna. Come and have a drink.
Sie will nicht kommen.
She won't come down? - Then we'll go up.
Come on, Theo. - Moment.
Moment. Die Flaschen.
Und the glasses.
Edith!
Edith, my child.
I feel like a proud father. Do you, Clive?
Why?
I have to give you away, don't I?
I told.
In fluent double German.
Das einzige Wort, das ich nicht finden konnte.
Fiancee, ja. A toast.
Here's to the happiness of my fiancee who was never my fiancee, and here's to the man who tried to kill me before he was introduced to me.
May I kiss the bride? Why ask?
I did not ask.
Goodbye, Clive. - Goodbye, Edith, old girl.
I hope we'll meet again sometime.
I'm sure we shall.
Now, listen to me, you son of a gun, you won't understand a word of what I'm going to say, but I came to Berlin to find a rat, and I found two of the grandest people I've ever met.
I leave to you, you Prussian stiff-neck you, this girl in trust, and if you dont take care of her, I'll raise the whole of England against you.
The Navy will steam up your stinking Stolpchensee, and I'll lead the Army down Unter den Linden, and we'll...
Clive... ..my English is not very much...
..but my friendship for you... ..is very much.
I hope it's taughtyou a good lesson, Candy.
Yes, sir.
The trouble with you young fellows is you want to go changing everything.
What's the result?
You spent all your leave in a nursing home full of foreigners.
You cost the Treasury a lot of money.
You make the Foreign Office very cross.
Yes, very cross.
And what do you get for it?
Your beauty's spoiled.
You weren't any fashion plate before.
I'd be surprised if any woman would look twice at you. - So would I.
When you were here in January,
I told you very clearly it was not your concern, it was an Embassy job.
Well, sir, I thought I'd take a chance.
A chance? A chance? !
You can't afford to take a chance with your career, my boy.
You are in the Army as a career, aren't you?
Not for five minutes?
You were putting up a pretty good show.
You go barging in on this nonsense, and you come very near to getting yourself kicked out.
You don't want to get kicked out, do you?
No, sir.
Well, let me tell you one thing.
Don't bother your head with things you don't understand and you won't go far wrong.
Never go off at half-cock. Keep cool.
Keep your mouth shut and avoid politicians like the plague.
That's the way to get on in the Army.
Thank you, sir.
Care to dine at my club tonight? - Sorry, sir.
I'm taking someone to the theatre. - Pretty?
I haven't met her yet, sir.
Oh, you're still a bit cracked, my boy.
Well, I hope you improve as you get older.
And cheer up, my boy.
Father, whose oath in hollow hell is heard, whose act is lightning after thunder-word.
A boon! A boon - that I compassion find for one, the most unhappy of mankind.
How is he named?
Ulysses.
He who planned to take the towered city of Troy-land.
What wouldst thou?
This! That he at the last may view the smoke of his own fire curling blue.
Where bides the man?
Calypso this long while detains him in her languorous ocean-isle.
Father of gods, this man hath stricken blind my dear son Polyphemus.
And with wind, with roaring waves, by me let him be hurled from sea to sea,
and dashed about the world.
Peace, children, and from your shrill reviling cease!
Hermes, command Calypso to release Ulysses, and to waft him over seas.
Ulysses shall return.
Cloud-gatherer, stay!
Yet canst thou work in mischief on the way.
Yet ere he touch at last his native shore,
Ulysses must abide one labour more.
Where's the bar?
Darling, do control yourself.
I say, there's old Suggie.
Really, darling?
Suggie?
Suggie? - ..
..Oh, Father, in thy youth, didst feel at least for mortal women ruth.
To Leda, Leto, Danae, we are told, didst show thee on occasion tenfold...
Who's the girl with Clive, darling?
Do you know her? - As a matter of fact, I do.
Well, darling, who is she?
I believe he met her sister in Berlin.
Darling, why all this mystery?
Who is she?
My niece's governess.
A Miss Hunter.
Wonders will never cease.
Sybil Gilpin out without her mother, and with Hoppy, too.
Didn't you know, Mr Candy?
They're married.
Hoppy and Sybil?
Over a month ago.
The family were quite taken by surprise.
It was very romantic and sudden.
And they met here in this very theatre.
I know.
I seem to be a born matchmaker.
Hello, Pebble.
Master Clive!
Your aunt is asleep. - All right.
Don't disturb her.
I didn't feel like going to the club.
You're not sick, Master Clive?
No.
I say, Pebble, how did you feel when you buried Mr Pebble?
Oh, it wasn't so bad at the time, Master Clive, there was so much to do.
It was after that it got bad, if you understand me.
I hope you haven't come from a burial, sir.
No, from the theatre, but it was the same thing, in a way.
Was it a sad play?
On the contrary, it was a musical play.
Is the bed in the den made up?
No, but it won't take a minute if you don't mind sleeping in blankets.
There isn't time to air the sheets. - Lady Margaret has made changes...
Pebble! What is going on down there?
Am I staying?
I suppose so, since there's no man here to throw you out.
I say, who put up my South African heads?
I don't know.
They don't look half so bad, do they?
Pebble, stop fussing like an old hen, and go to your bed.
Yes, my lady.
Good night, Master Clive.
Now, even money that some catastrophe has brought you here.
You're on. - Debts?
No.
A woman.
Not exactly.
Explain.
I went to the theatre tonight.
Alone? - With a girl.
And why, pray, is she "not exactly"?
Oh, it was nothing to do with her.
Perhaps.
See anyone there you knew?
I met Hoppy and Sybil Gilpin. They're married.
Why not? A very suitable match.
He has money, and she has land, and neither of them has any brains.
You surely weren't in love with her.
With Sybil?
Oh, no.
I'm glad of that.
She has the muscles of a prize fighter. She'll hit him one day.
Hoppy could give her a couple of stone.
She'll soon make that up, I assure you.
Who is this girl you took to the theatre tonight?
A Miss Hunter.
I met her sister in Berlin.
Is she nice?
Very.
I mean the sister.
Which sister?
The one that stayed in Berlin.
Then the one in London is not so nice, I take it.
I see.
Now, listen, Clive.
I have 18 rooms here, a bone-idle staff eating their heads off, and when you come home from South Africa,
you go straight to your club.
I know, it's awful.
I want you to remember that whatever you do, and wherever you are, you've always got a home here... and, whatever you shoot, there's always room for them here, too.
Look how much room there is.
This is Dead Cow Crossroads, sir.
The question is whether that's the church with the double tower or the Estaminet du Pont.
Damn it, Murdoch, you're supposed to know the road.
I know it at night, sir.
In the daytime it looks different.
Got a scent?
Yes, sir.
Yon's our road, sir.
I can smell the two horses those sappers didnae bury.
Hark away, then.
Hark away, sir.
Glad to see you, sir.
I've got another umbrella for you.
You've a marvellous eye for loot, van Zijl.
Learnt from the English in the Boer War, sir.
Where did you get them?
Off the Jerries. 11 of them brought in an hour ago.
They were using them for camouflage against aircraft. Lord knows where they stole them.
Good evening. - Good evening, sir.
Evening, sir.
Can we get through to the RTO at Dupuis-sur-Something?
Dupuis-sur-Croix.
The Yanks are down there. How about it, Paddy?
I'm afraid the line's down between us and Mile 14, sir.
I can send a runner.
What message, sir?
Tell him to hold a place on the leave train.
When can I leave here?
Not before dark.
They're plastering the road between 1 -7 and 1 -9 with shrapnel. - Right.
Someone look after Murdoch.
Nobby.
Very good, sir.
Mind the leak, sir.
Freddie, get that runner away.
If any of you have any important letters or messages home, I'll take them.
Thank you, sir.
Paddy?
Just now I'll see the prisoners again.
All right, sir.
What are these prisoners?
Ulans. 2nd Regiment.
That's all I've got out of them so far.
I'd like to question them.
Certainly, sir.
Paddy?
The 2nd Regiment of Ulans. - Sir?
Bring in the prisoners,
and tell the orderly to light the lamp.
Any officer with them?
Not so lucky. - Where did you nab them?
Floating down the river early this morning.
I had a boom across, and netted them like salmon.
They had 100lb of dynamite with them.
My guess is they were after the new pontoon bridge below St Mangy.
How the devil did they get to know about that?
They took one of our patrols prisoner the day before yesterday.
Are you suggesting that our fellows talked?
The Germans know how to make them talk.
Well, if they are, they're cracking, my dear chap. It's a sure sign.
Nobody starts to fight foul till he sees he can't win any other way.
I quite believe Hindenburg, who I heard said the other day that until now, Germany has used her arms with honour.
I admit he said nothing about her legs!
Halt!
Left turn!
Get that off to Brigade - in the morning.
Certainly, sir.
Do any of you know Oberst Kretschmar-Schuldorff?
Dont play deaf.
He was an Oberst in your regiment the last time I heard of him.
Oberst Kretschmar-Schuldorff, 2nd Regiment of Ulans.
Which of you can speak English?
You spoke English an hour ago.
Answer the Brigadier.
I do speak.
Now, listen to me.
We don't use the same methods that I hear you use on your prisoners, but I assure you we have means to find out what we want.
What was this explosive - found on you intended for?
I don't know.
Don't lie.
I do not know.
You took three men prisoner two days ago. - No.
Then how did you know about the bridge?
I know nothing about a bridge.
Then why were you carrying dynamite?
Quite safe to go now, sir.
Your car's waiting.
Won't you stay for dinner, sir?
What have you got?
Macaroni. We found it in the cellar.
Beastly stuff.
And the usual corned horse.
Oh, I think I'll take my chance at Dupuis.
It's a pity I've got to go.
I'd like to have another shot at those prisoners.
Oh, I think I've got the idea, sir.
I'll tackle them for you.
Right.
Make your report to Brigade. - Very good, sir.
Now, listen.
I am in command here now.
And I know how to deal with you scum.
I'm not a simple English gentleman.
I'm a simple South African.
And I can assure you that I have means to get what I want.
What was the dynamite for?
How many of you got away?
What happened to the three men you took prisoners?
30 seconds to reply.
8:35.
8:35.
Hello! Hello!
Dammit.
The lousy line's dead, sir. I can't get Beechwood.
Keep trying.
And what do you want?
I'm Brigadier General Candy.
I'm sorry, sir. Sit down. Take the load off your feet.
I couldn't see your brass for the mud.
What can I do for you?
You're the railway transport officer?
I run trains, if that's what you mean. - That is, when there are any trains to run.
Did you get my chit?
Will you, for the Lord's sake, get me through to Beechwood?
The Colonel's having kittens. Try the other circuit.
You said "chit"?
Yes.
What's a chit?
A message, man. A message.
I want transport to London. It's urgent.
There hasn't been any message since I've been on duty.
I'll see what we can do for you.
Jake, get RTO at Ami-le-Bon, will you?
Yes, Colonel.
Yes, we're trying to get through, sir. We're trying the other circuit.
Yes, I'll let you know.
A merry little madhouse we've got here.
Yes, very.
When does my train leave?
Where do I change?
And where can I get some food?
I thought so. Thanks very much.
Yeah, it's what I thought. You'll have to go through to Ami-le-Bon.
I've come from Ami-le-Bon to catch a train here.
My motorcar is stuck in the mud...
What's that?
The hell, you say?
Thanks a lot.
That's that.
What's what?
A German delegation is on its way to see General Foch. They're going to
sue for an armistice.
Yippee!
Nonsense!
German propaganda. Old trick to put us off our guard.
What about my train?
There's not a train, or a track, or a locomotive to pull one, sir.
In this war, I've seen ammunition dumps without ammunition, field kitchens with no cooks, motorcars with no petrol to run them on, so I suppose I shouldn't be surprised to find a railway transport officer without trains.
But let me tell you this, young man, that in the Boer War or in Somaliland, this sort of inefficiency wouldn't have been tolerated for a second.
Now, where can I get some grub?
The Crown of Thorns is good for a hand-out at almost any hour.
What is it? A pub?
A pub, sir?
I don't get you.
Oh, dash it.
We don't speak the same language.
Er... a cafe?
No, sir. It's a convent.
It's on the way to Ami-le-Bon.
Show me the way, will you?
I think I hear Armstrong coming with a bathtub now.
Armstrong, I want you to take the General here over to the Crown of Thorns.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir, General. I sure will do that.
It's kinda damp, but I'll get you there.
You're off.
Poor show I couldn't get a train tonight.
I've wasted 24 hours of my leave.
You can step on it, Armstrong.
The General's in a hurry.
I sure will do that.
Well, goodbye, General.
What were those other wars he was talking about, Captain? The Boer War and the Somi-something?
I never heard of them.
Those weren't wars. Those were just summer manoeuvres.
Here we are, General.
The Convent of the Crown of Thorns.
Let me give you a hand.
I can manage. Thank you.
Qui est la?
Bonsoir, Sister Jacqueline.
Bonsoir, Napoleon.
I've brought you a real live colonel.
Good night, General. Bon appetit.
Good night, Sister Jacqueline.
Bonne nuit, Napoleon.
Bonsoir, madame.
Good evening, General. Ah, Matron.
For heaven's sake, tell your girls to sit down. - Sit down, nurses.
Sit down.
And your coat.
General, you have fallen on your feet.
I was beginning to think so.
I have 62 freshly trained nurses straight from England, and all dying to nurse someone. - Now, what's the trouble?
Trouble, Matron?
Well, the nun said you'd eaten something.
She got it wrong. I want to eat.
I'm hungry.
We shall be delighted to have you with us.
Thank you.
You've been in the front line? I suppose you have.
I was with the Italians. I was lucky. I came through Caporetto without a scratch.
Good heavens, Matron.
What insect powder do you use?
Come and sit over here, General, will you?
Move along a bit, my dear.
Could you pass the water?
Splendid.
Thank you, Nurse.
Matron, have you ever seen the Indian rope trick?
No, General. Have you?
It must be an incredible sight.
Yes, but I've never heard of anybody who's seen it, unless he heard he was going to see it
I beg your pardon.
I don't quite understand.
You hear about a thing, you hope to see it, and then you see it. Yes, General.
Will you excuse me? One moment, Matron.
Do you know that girl over there? I'm afraid I don't.
I only met them here at the station.
Come along, nurses. Bed, everyone.
Bed, everybody.
Come on, Wynne.
Nurse, do you know the name of the girl sitting at the end of that table?
Dark or fair?
Fair.
Oh, I don't remember.
Can you describe her better? Well, she was fair.
I didn't see the colour of her eyes.
Sorry. Well, it might be anyone.
Excuse me, General.
Where do you come from? What detachment are you?
Yorkshire.
West Riding, most of us.
Good night, General.
Good night.
How long now?
Not long now, sir.
You've said that ten separate times.
I know, sir. - Well, hurry.
The train leaves at 10:30.
I know, sir.
I need time at Ami-le-Bon. I'm going to GHQ. - I know, sir.
Stop talking like an infernal parrot, Murdoch.
I was told, sir. - Who told you?
Major van Zijl's batman, sir.
What did he say?
That you were up in the air because the Major got information from the Jerries - the prisoners.
Your misinformation, Murdoch, is typical. - Thank you, sir.
Four pages of confessions not worth...
Kretschmar-Schuldorrf?
There can't be two of them with a name like that, eh, Murdoch? - No, sir.
You don't know what on earth I'm talking about.
No, sir.
Haven't I told you about the time I was in Berlin in 1902?
When you grew your moustache, sir?
And yet you can't remember the name Kretschmar-Schuldorff.
You ought to bequeath that brain of yours - to Guy's Hospital.
Oh, I remember now, sir. He married the girl.
Yes.
He married the girl.
Last night, Murdoch, I saw a girl, a nurse, straight from England.
I've never seen a more striking resemblance.
She must have been a very common type of girl, sir.
The young lady in Berlin, I mean.
She was the most uncommon...
What the devil do you mean, Murdoch?
Well, sir, there was that girl in the film. You remember? You went nine times.
And that girl in the group out of the Bystander.
We lost it in the big push, didn't we? And then there's...
Despatch rider coming, sir.
General Candy? - Yes.
Urgent message from Major van Zijl, sir.
Came over the wire from Mile 14.
They've mended the line, sir.
Any answer, sir?
No answer.
Anything wrong, sir?
Murdoch, the war is over.
Is it, sir?
The Germans have accepted the terms of the armistice.
Hostilities cease at ten o'clock, and it's nearly that now.
Murdoch, do you know what this means?
I do, sir.
Peace.
We can go home.
Everybody can go home.
For me, Murdoch, it means more than that.
It means that right is might, after all.
The Germans have shelled hospitals, bombed open towns, sunk neutral ships, used poison gas... and we won.
Clean fighting, honest soldiering have won.
Murdoch.
Miss Barbara!
Lunch is ready!
Barbara!
Don't listen to them.
Now, you listen to me.
There I was, asleep.
You'd never seen me before.
You never even spoke to me then.
How could you be so sure?
Can I ask you a question first?
You're wriggling.
All right. Fire away.
How can you be so sure?
I'm 20 years older than you are, and I'm a soldier.
When other people are thanking God the war is over,
I'm going to the War Office to ask, "Where is another war where you can use me?"
You asked me that once before, and I told you.
I'm asking you again, because I want to hear it again.
And again.
I'm marrying you because I want to join the Army and see the world.
I'm marrying you because I love watching you play polo.
I'm marrying you for 50 different reasons, and they all mean that's how I imagined my future husband.
Same here.
That's how I imagined my future wife.
Oh, the gong's the final appeal. Darling, we must go. We've got the bishop for lunch.
I hope he's tender.
And now, in conclusion, I...
I should like to say a few words to General Candy.
We members of the Church Militant can admire the heroes of the war, but in our hearts we are men of peace.
And so I am glad to have met you for the first time, as I did, sir, on a simple and heart-warming occasion, rather than at some military ceremonial.
When I first heard that a general of the British Army was arranging a ball for the benefit of those nurses of the West Riding who had taken part in the four-year struggle, I said to myself,
'There is a man whose heart is in the right place.'
And I am glad to be able to tell you that one result is that the sum of one hundred and thirty-one pounds, two and sixpence will be handed over to the War Nurses' Benevolent Fund.
My Lord Bishop, I want to make a confession.
I first saw Barbara in Flanders on the last night of the war.
She was a nurse among 70 other nurses.
I never knew her name, but I found out that most of the nurses came from Yorkshire, and the West Riding.
And, of course, she was a nurse.
So, I thought to myself...
Well, Yorkshire's a big place, my Lord Bishop.
So, I thought, 'How can I find a nurse in Yorkshire?
You understand who I'm driving at, I suppose?
I understand exactly what you mean, darling.
That window is the den.
Wrong. Next floor's the den.
That's the bathroom.
They're here.
Is yon grey head Murdoch?
His idea of greeting the conquering hero, I suppose.
I think I shall like Murdoch.
And I know I shall like this house.
Clive, let this whole house be our den, where we can always crawl, whether we return with rich spoils, or badly mauled from our rovings, or just to change our spots.
Aunt Margaret would have loved you for that.
It's a fine, solid-looking property.
Clive, you won't change, will you?
And don't ever leave this house.
No fear!
And even if there's a second Flood, this house shall always stand on solid foundations.
We'll have a private lake in the basement.
That's a promise. - You'll stay just as you are till the floods come.
Till the floods come.
And this is a lake.
And this is a lake.
I'm sorry, ma'am.
Mrs Candy. I was at the top of the house.
I wasn't expecting you so early.
Well, Murdoch, this is the wife.
So, you're Murdoch.
Yes, madam.
The first time I've heard anything but "Yes, sir".
Everything is under control.
I've had the telephone installed.
Good.
The agency has a lot of cooks for you...
Let's get inside.
We'll have some fun with this.
The tradespeople called. They'll call again.
That's all right. Not staying this time.
Off tonight.
Eight weeks Paris. Then we'll put our feet up, - and have a big party.
Yes, sir.
I got your letters from the club, sir.
I'm so sorry, Murdoch.
You took such a lot of trouble.
Oh, that's all right, ma'am.
We're used to it.
I told the porter the General wouldn't be using the club so much.
Oh, what did he say?
Well, go on, Murdoch. I can bear it.
Yes, ma'am.
He said, "They all say that at first," ma'am.
I say! Barbara?
Here's an answer from the Prisoners ofWar Committee.
Yes, Oberst Kretschmar-Schuldorff, 2nd Regiment, Ulans of the Guard. - Oh, have they found him?
Camp VII, Hardwick Hall, Derbyshire.
Poor old Theo.
Darling?
Let's postpone Paris.
I'd love to meet him.
Message, sir, from the commandant's office.
No answer.
Excuse me, sir, but...
He said no answer, sir.
No answer? What else?
Nothing, sir.
He refused to come?
If that was the message, madam.
Why is "very much"
printed like that?
It was a joke we had.
Where was the Oberst?
Listening to the band, sir.
All right, Higgins.
I was thinking... ..how odd they are.
For years and years, they're writing and dreaming beautiful music and beautiful poetry.
All of a sudden they start a war.
They sink undefended ships, shoot innocent hostages, and bomb and destroy whole streets in London, killing little children.
And then they sit down in the same butcher's uniform, and listen to Mendelssohn and Schubert.
There's something horrid about that.
Dontyou think so, Clive?
Perhaps I should have written in German.
He understands English.
They all learn English while they're here.
Do you mind if we had a try?
Perhaps it was because of the music. There's an interval now.
By all means try, sir, but Mrs Candy had better remain.
Yes.
I can't understand it.
I've written to him before the war and he's written to me.
They stopped English lessons on 11th November.
On Armistice Day.
Oberst Kretschmar-Schuldorff?
Over there.
Theo!
Ah, Davies!
Hello, Candy. I hope your wife will forgive me.
You didn't read the invitation.
Bachelor party, eh?
If I'd known your charming wife wasn't here, I wouldn't have hurried.
We'll get you something.
I had dinner on the train.
I came from Victoria.
Leave?
No, duty.
Come and have a glass of port.
This is Brigadier General Candy's residence.
May I speak to the General, please?
Whom may we ask is speaking?
Oberst Kretschmar-Schuldorrf.
I'm at Victoria station.
Tell him I'm leaving London tonight.
Do you mind repeating the name, sir?
Oberst Kretschmar-Schuldorrf.
Thank you, sir.
Can't he phone tomorrow?
Where's he speaking from?
Victoria station, sir.
He's leaving tonight, he said.
It sounded like Wrenchbar something, sir.
Kretschmar-Schuldorff!
That's it, sir.
Murdoch, that brain of yours ought to be in a bottle.
Yes, it's me, Theo.
How are you, my friend?
Yes, I'm going home.
If there's such a thing left in Germany.
There are scores of us here. Can't you hear them?
We have an extra train. It leaves at 11 :30.
Yes, yes, we are under guard.
Er, Clive...
I may still call you Clive now you're a general?
Cut the cackle.
What have you got to say for yourself?
Look, I'm sorry, I'm terribly sorry... ..because of our meeting at the camp.
I was a silly fool.
Yes. I felt I had to tell you before I leave.
I must ring off now. Good luck to you all.
Major Davies.
Yes?
Come here a moment, will you?
I'll send you back to Derbyshire if you're not careful.
You just sit tight and we'll come and get you.
All right, all right. I won't run away.
Would you mind, Lieutenant?
You Prussian stiff-neck. The only way to get you is to kidnap you.
Let's have a look at you.
Ah, you've worn well, old chap.
You've still got my mark, I see.
You still need a moustache.
When were you captured?
July '16.
You were lucky. You missed the worst.
I'd rather be unlucky.
Have you heard from home?
Have you got any children?
How about Edith?
What shall I answer first?
Edith is all right as far as I know and, yes, we have two children.
Boys, eh?
Now, that one's exactly like Edith.
Karl. He is, isn't he?
I almost wish we had no children.
What?
What future do they have in a beaten country?
You Germans are all a bit crazy.
Barbara will tell you what's what.
Who?
My wife. Oh, you don't know I'm married.
You'll get a shock when you see her.
Shock? I'm sure she's charming.
I don't mean that. You wait and see.
Oh, you won't see her. She's gone to the theatre with her mother.
Never mind. Have you got any more snapshots?
Tell me about yourself.
Neither were much good.
Gentlemen, this is my friend Oberst Kretschmar-Schuldorff.
Sir Archibald Blair, shining light of the Foreign Office.
How do you do?
General Betteridge.
How do you do?
I've heard about you, Oberst.
General Keen.
How do?
Major Michael Cornish and his brother Major...
John.
.. John Cornish.
Admiral Sir Merton Barrow of the so-called Senior Service.
Commodore Brandon-Crester.
Ditto.
Major Davies you know.
Lntimately.
Colonel Hopwell, aide to the Governor of Gibraltar.
How do you do, my dear fellow?
Sir William Rendall, on the Viceroy's staff.
How do you do?
George Metcalf of Uganda.
Sir John Bembridge, just back from Jamaica.
How do you do, sir?
Colonel Mannering, known to the press - as the uncrowned king of Southern Arabia.
How do you do?
M r Christopher Wynne - of Bradford, England, my father-in-law.
How are you?
How do you do?
Embodiment of all the solid virtues.
Sit down, Theo.
What will you have to drink?
Port, please.
Port.
Pass the port.
It has to go round the clock.
Cigar?
Cigarette?
Cigarette.
They're both on the table. - Turkish or Virginian?
I don't suppose you remember me...
but we met in Berlin in '02.
Oh, did we?
Ah, Barstow.
Colonel Barstow of the Royal Air Force - Oberst Kretschmar-Schuldorff.
How do you do?
Glad to see you're off home now.
Thank you, sir.
Awful being a prisoner of war in England.
I don't think it is much good anywhere.
Oh, my dear fellow, in this country people poke their nose into everything.
Did you get any letters from spinsters?
Yes, we have.
They started a campaign to write to prisoners of war.
Not our chaps, mind you.
It wasnt so bad.
We had books, concerts, lectures.
I'm sure your camp was well run.
German organisation is very thorough.
A bit too thorough for us.
Was the cooking good?
It was English cooking.
He's got a sense of humour.
My daughter Joyce started a campaign to better the food of the German prisoners.
I remember the Government was also charged with overfeeding them.
Oh, we're not too bad. Drink up, Theo.
Gentlemen... your health.
Cheer up.
Good luck.
By the way, what have you done with Tiger Blomfield?
At Victoria, in the Grosvenor bar. He was hostage for the Oberst.
Where is the sense of guarding officer prisoners - a year after the fighting's over?
I imagine it is more to protect us.
Against what?
People.
What people?
Yours.
How do you mean?
They can't be adjusted from war to peace as easily as you can, gentlemen.
I think you'll find that's not true.
Do you mean to say our people would attack you in that uniform?
I tried to kill Englishmen in this uniform.
My dear fellow, that's rather a gloomy point of view.
You've got the wrong end of the stick.
The war's over.
There's nothing to bear malice about.
You're a decent fellow and so are we.
I am not a decent fellow, I am a beggar.
Like the rest of all the professional soldiers in our army.
A beaten country can't have an army, - so what are we going to do?
There'll be a great deal to do.
But not for us.
We know a bit about horses.
We can become stableboys.
You'll feel differently when you're home again.
But what will the home be like? Another prison camp.
Who says so?
We're going to have foreign troops occupying our cities for years.
For years?
I like that. - I've never heard a man more wrong.
We don't want to make beggars of you.
We're a trading nation. We must have countries to trade with.
Surely you realise that the reconstruction of Germany is essential to the peace of Europe?
I can't see our taxpayers keeping an army in your country, can you, Candy?
No, of course not. Read the papers, man - the English papers.
We can't ask you to be our friends if we'd rob you and humiliate you too.
That's how we all feel, eh?
ALL: Hear, hear!
We want to be friends.
We want to trade with Germany," said one.
A general said, "We don't want to keep an eye on you just to occupy your country."
A general!
Oh, they are... children.
Boys playing cricket.
They win the shirts off our backs and now they want to give them back.
Because the game is over.
War is a most unpopular thing in England.
They are already organising pacifist societies.
Their newspapers are anti-milita....
Wait a moment.
Here we can get to something.
Anti-military.
This childlike stupidity is a raft for us... ..in a sea of despair.
Do you know what my friend General Candy said?
Don't you worry, old chap, we'll soon have Germany on her feet again."
I think we made an impression on him.
The last thing I said to him was,
'Dontyou worry. We'll soon have Germany on her feet again.'
And he believed it?
Theo?
I believe so.
I... hope so.
Darling.
Don't hum.
Was I humming?
It's a little habit you've got.
What'll I do if I don't hum?
Theodor Kretschmar-Schuldorrf.
This way, please.
Your registration book and identity card, please.
Sit down.
When did you arrive in this country?
The 6th of June, '35.
From?
Paris, France.
I arrived in France the 15th of January '34.
From Germany?
Why did you leave Germany?
My outlook of life is against the Nazis.
Most refugees left Germany early in 1933 when Hitler came to power.
I had nothing to fear from Hitler.
I thought so.
It took me eight months to find out I was wrong.
Rather a long time.
Don't you think so?
Please, I mean no offence, but you in England took five years.
Yes, quite right.
Have you been in England before?
Yes.
I was prisoner of war in the last war.
I see you were an officer.
When did you leave the Army?
In 1920.
Eight out of ten officers had to retire when the German Army ceased to exist...
as a large army.
You prefer the existence of a large army?
Not any more.
In '20 I chose a new profession. I became a military chemist.
I worked for 13 years in a factory in Mannheim.
Are you married?
My wife is dead.
Children?
Two.
I have no connection with them.
They are good Nazis.
As far as any Nazi can be called good.
I am afraid, Mr Kretschmar-Schuldorff, that doesn't sound very much in your favour.
I've tried to answer correctly.
Personally, I don't doubt your good faith, but I'm here to safeguard my country's interests.
You may be an anti-Nazi, you may not be.
In times like these, one enemy in our midst can do more harm than ten across the Channel.
If you were here to work for the enemy, what would you tell me now?
Exactly the same. That you were a friend of England.
That our enemy was your enemy.
I know this is hard on those who are really with us, but it should be their best assurance that this time we mean business.
If you are a friend, ourprecautions are your precautions, and our interests your interests... because our victory will be your victory.
Is there anything else you'd like to say?
If you don't mind, sir.
No, go ahead.
In earlier years, the most important principle of my life used to be "never lie,
always tell the truth.'
A very good principle.
I hope you stick to it.
Oh, I have not told a lie, but I...
I also have not told the truth.
A refugee soon learns that there's a big difference between the two.
The truth about me is that I'm a tired old man who came to this country because he is homesick.
Oh, please, don't stare at me like that, sir.
I am all right in the head.
You know that after the war we had very bad years in Germany.
We got poorer and poorer.
Every day retired officers and schoolteachers were caught shoplifting.
Money lost its value.
The price of everything rose... except of human beings.
We read in the papers that the after-war years were bad everywhere.
That crime was increasing and honest citizens were having a hard job to put the gangsters in jail.
Well, I needn't tell you, sir, that in Germany the gangsters finally succeeded in putting the honest citizens in jail.
My wife was English.
She would have loved to come back to England.
But it seemed to me that I would be letting down my country in its greatest need.
And so she stayed at my side.
When, in summer '33, we found... that we had lost our children to the Nazi party,
and I was willing to come, she died.
None of my sons came to her funeral.
Heil Hitler.
And then, in January '35, I had to go to Berlin on a mission for my firm.
Driving up in my car, I lost my way on the outskirts of the city, and suddenly... the landscape seemed so familiar to me.
And slowly I recognised... the road, the lake... ..and a nursing home where I spent some weeks recovering...
..almost 40 years ago.
I stopped the car and sat still... remembering.
You see, in this very nursing home, sir, I met my wife for the first time.
And I met an Englishman who became my greatest friend.
And I remembered the people at the station in '19, when we prisoners were sent home... cheering us, treating us like friends.
The faces of a party of distinguished men around a table, who tried their utmost to comfort me when the defeat of my country seemed to me unbearable.
And... very foolishly... ..I remembered the English countryside,
the gardens, the green lawns, the weedy rivers and the trees...
..she loved so much.
And a great desire came over me to come back to my wife's country.
And this, sir, is the truth.
Haven't you got anyone in this country who knows you well?
A British citizen?
The doorman at the chemical works where I offered my services.
The police officers at the Aliens' Department at Bow Street.
Sentry.
Don't you know Major General Clive Wynne-Candy?
Yes, sir, I used to know him.
Did you ask him to come here and testify on your behalf?
Yes, I did send him a letter, but I suppose he...
Theo, my dear chap.
Let's have a good look at you.
By God, you've kept your figure better than I have.
Bit of a bay window, what?
You see, sir, I wouldn't be surprised if this fellow disliked us.
He comes to England twice in his life.
The first time he's a prisoner, and the second time he's about to be one.
May I talk to him, sir?
I haven't seen him for 19... - 20.
..20 years and a bit.
Not here, General. We have many Kretschmar-Schuldorffs waiting.
Do you mean to say that I've travelled 11 hours from... mustn't say where... and you won't allow me to have a word with a condemned man?
Do you have to go back this minute?
Tomorrow. Infernally early.
That's all right. You can talk to him all day and all night, till midnight.
Aliens' curfew, you know.
And I can take him with me?
If you say you know him.
Do I know him?
And will stand surety for him?
With everything I have, sir.
It's time I was going.
The night's young yet.
Don't you remember? Curfew for aliens. - Oh, yes.
I have to be at home by midnight.
Don't forget, sir, you've to be up at six.
Early parade, eh? - Aye.
How lucky you are, Clive.
Yes, they put me on the retired list in '35, but I knew they'd want me again.
Back I went on the active list like a shot.
I mean...
Why don't you stay?
I've 18 rooms.
Murdoch, rally round.
Thank you. I'd better not.
I would need a special permit anyway.
All right, Murdoch, as you were.
Stay a little longer.
I'll send you home by car.
Murdoch, tell Miss Cannon to be here by quarter to twelve.
Very good, sir.
Who is Miss Cannon?
Miss Cannon?
My driver.
Do you remember, Clive, we used to say,
Our armies are fighting for our women, our children and our homes"?
Now the women are fighting beside the men.
The children are being trained to shoot.
What's left is the home.
But what is the home without women and children?
You never met my wife.
Would you like to see a picture of her?
Very much.
Do you remember when that was all I was able to say in English?
Very much.
You got further with them than I ever got.
In what respect?
Dash it, don't tell me you didn't know.
Knew what?
Well, you make me blush.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I thought it was written all over my face when I left Berlin in '02.
Don't forget, I never saw your face after you left.
I was in love with her.
Your wife.
She never told me.
She never knew.
But I seem to remem... Oh, Clive, that last day in Berlin when I told you, you seemed genuinely happy.
Dash it, I didn't know then.
But on the train I started to miss her.
On the boat it was worse.
By the time I got back to London, well, I'd got it properly.
My Aunt Margaret got onto the scent right away.
Women have a nose for these things.
Besides, I did a stupid thing.
The first night back, I took out her sister.
Aunt Margaret's?
Edith's.
Who? Martha?
Yes.
What's stupid about that?
Thinking her sister would be like she was.
Like Edith?
Yes.
Well... you got over it.
That's just it. I never got over it.
Theo, this may sound a damned silly thing to say to you, but...
I never got over it.
You may say that she was my ideal... if you were some sort of sickening long-haired poet.
All my life I've been looking for a woman like her.
So now you know.
I never thought it possible that an Englishman could be so romantic.
And your wife?
You don't mind me asking you...
but you loved her?
Yes... dreadfully.
She was exactly like Edith.
I'll show her to you.
Oh, she's very lovely.
But isn't she like Edith, eh?
See the resemblance?
Yes, there's something very striking.
But you must not forget, I saw Edith 31 years later than you.
We grew old together.
You understand?
Ah, yes, of course.
But she was exactly like her.
It's a strange place to hang such a lovely picture.
She wanted it. I call this my den, you know.
She always knew why I used to come back here. We had a joke about it.
All my stuffs here.
It'd be an awful gap without her.
Have a peg, what?
It must be terrible to lose someone very dear to you in a foreign country.
It wasn't a foreign country, it was Jamaica.
Bye, Clive. Have a nice journey.
Don't worry about anything. It's under control.
Can you close the door, sir, please?
Shut up, Murdoch.
Good luck, Murdoch.
Thank you, sir, but I'm staying behind to look after things here.
You know the way, Angela?
Yes, sir.
The door, sir, please.
Did you see the warden?
I'm the warden of this district, sir.
It must be very difficult to drive in the blackout.
It's not as bad as it looks, sir.
I suppose you've done a lot of night driving.
I never drove before the war.
What made you learn it?
My boyfriend taught me.
But not at night.
Is he a good driver?
First-rate.
He's one of the Bentley boys.
Just now he walks on his two flat feet.
He's a private in training.
What was your job before the war, Miss Cannon?
Photographic model.
Oh, interesting work.
Not bad. A bit hard on the feet.
How did you know my name, sir?
The General talked about you.
Oh, did he?
Mind if we try and beat the light, sir?
No, not at all.
Sorry, sir, couldn't make it.
Do you like being the General's driver? Of course.
Who wouldn't? He's such an old darling.
I could have done a handstand when he asked for me.
Do you know, he chose me out of 700 girls.
Some odds, isnt it, 700-1?
For crying out loud, look at that light. He ought to be reported.
Come on, don't be all night.
That's what causes accidents.
Long odds, weren't they, sir?
I beg your pardon?
700-1.
Makes me a bit of an outsider.
What is your first name, Miss Cannon?
Angela.
That's a lovely name.
Comes from angel, doesn't it?
I think it stinks.
My friends call me Johnny.
Is it this crossing or the next, sir?
Oh, this will do here.
Good night, Angela.
Good night, sir.
I'd like to see your boyfriend one of these days.
Me too.
Good night, sir.
He's on his way down now.
For the love of Gielgud, go and stop him.
If you let him put one whisker in the studio, you are out.
This way, General. - Thank you.
General Wynne-Candy?
This way to Studio 5, sir.
Mr Marsh wants to see you.
Never heard of him.
He's heard of you, sir.
Has he?
Good.
This way to Studio 5.
What time does my broadcast start?
Almost at once, sir.
At 21 :20, sir.
Plenty of time.
Excuse me, miss.
Oh, shut up.
A regular warren, eh?
Yes.
Beehive of industry.
Yes, sir.
Do you like it here? - Yes.
You meet such interesting people.
You can tell that from the programmes.
General Wynne-Candy.
I don't think we've met.
No, I've not had that pleasure.
Do sit down.
Thank you.
Cigarette? - Thank you.
Very snug quarters you've got here.
Yes, we have to be deep these days.
I quite agree. Back to the Stone Age.
I don't think I'll light this at the moment.
Bad for speaking. Makes my throat dry.
General, I'm afraid we've been having some trouble about your broadcast.
Well, I'm used to trouble. I'm a soldier.
Yes, the er... authorities... ..think that it's a little ill-timed and might be better postponed.
Think it's a little ill-timed?
Who has been saying that?
Why?
Well, General, you know in times of war...
Don't talk to me about war.
No, of course, that would be... grotesque.
I have been asked to describe in this broadcast my views on the cause of the retreat and its aspects for the future.
I've served my country for 44 years.
What was your position before this? - I was a lawyer. - What?
A lawyer.
A lawyer?
Well, I was a soldier.
And before that I suppose you were at college.
And I was a soldier.
And I was a soldier when you were a baby.
And before you were born, sir, when you were nothing but a toss-up between a girl's and a boy's name, I was a soldier.
I'm deeply sorry, sir.
I know it's not you.
No, I'm afraid it isn't.
I'll make the necessary enquiries through the War Office.
I'll have a light for this cigarette now, if you please.
Malta this morning had its 25th air raid since Italy entered the war last Monday.
It's not known if there was any damage or casualties.
Cigarette, soldier?
In yesterday's raids one civilian was killed and eight were wounded.
That brings us to the end of the news and to tonight's Postscript, which is given by Mr JB Priestley.
What on earth can have happened?
M urdoch, do you think he's had an accident?
I cannae think.
I was expecting it.
Why?
I read his speech.
I thought they would cancel it.
It's him.
Sorry about the slight delay.
Now here is Mr Priestley.
Where can I go?
The General mustn't find me here.
Let me handle it.
Oh, no fear.
You let me out of here.
Hello, Theo.
If supper's ready you can serve it, Murdoch.
I'm very sorry, sir.
Why? - I shouldn't be here.
I asked Miss Cannon in.
She was anxious to hear your broadcast.
Cancelled at the last minute.
Pity we hurried as we did, Angela.
We didn't leave the War Office till five-and-twenty to nine.
There's a War Office letter, sir.
It came this afternoon.
Paul Reynaud has resigned.
Petain is Prime Minister. THEO:
Bad news. - What?
Oh, yes, bad news.
Sherry, sir?
Er... yes.
Sherry, miss?
Sherry, Mr Sch... Sir? - Yes, please.
Thank you.
How is your fiance?
He's not my fiance. - Oh, beg your pardon.
How is your boyfriend?
He's getting a commission.
Oh, congratulations.
I ought to go, you know.
No, no.
Stay a bit longer.
Cheers.
Down the hatch.
Any news about your application?
Turned down. Enemy alien.
But you're an expert.
Why didn't you ask him? He knows everybody.
He was away.
Dinner's served, sir.
Yes.
I'm going, sir. Do you want the car any more?
I brought an extra cover, sir.
Sit down, Angela...
Sit down, both of you.
Thank you, sir, I've had my dinner.
Have another one, Angela.
If you're worried about sitting down with your general, then stop worrying.
I'm not a general any more.
Clive, what has happened?
Retired again. Axed.
They don't need me any more.
I'm sorry, sir.
I know how that feels.
No, you don't.
I was barely 45 when it happened to me.
Different kettle of fish. You were made to do it.
But we're not finished.
Nor am I. Just starting.
I've often thought, a fellow like me dies - special knowledge - awful waste.
Well, am I dead?
Does my knowledge count for nothing?
Experience, skill?
You tell me.
It is a different knowledge they need now, Clive.
The enemy's different, so you have to be different too.
Are you mad?
I know what war is.
I don't agree. - You...
I read your broadcast up to the point where you described the collapse of France.
You commented on Nazi methods - foul fighting, bombing refugees, machine-gunning hospitals, lifeboats, bailed-out pilots and so on - by saying that you despised them, that you would be ashamed to fight on their side and that you'd sooner accept defeat than victory
if it could only be won by those methods.
So I would.
Clive, if you let yourself be defeated by them just because you are too fair to hit back the same way they hit at you,
there won't be any methods but Nazi methods.
If you preach the rules of the game while they use every foul and filthy trick against you, they'll laugh at you.
They'll think you are weak, decadent.
I thought so myself in 1919.
I heard all that in the last war.
They fought foul then and who won it?
I don't think you won it.
We lost it, but you lost something too.
You forgot to learn the moral.
Because victory was yours, you failed to learn your lesson 20 years ago.
And now you have to pay the school fees again.
Some of you will learn quicker than the others.
Some will never learn it.
Because you've been educated to be a gentleman and a sportsman in peace and in war.
But, Clive... ..dear old Clive...
..this is not a gentleman's war.
This time you are fighting for your very existence, against the most devilish idea ever created by a human brain.
Nazism.
And if you lose... ..there won't be a return match next year.
Perhaps not even for a hundred years.
Oh, you... you mustn't mind me, an alien, saying all this.
But who can describe hydrophobia better than one who's been bitten... ..and is now immune?
Well, you see, Angela, even one's best friend lets one down.
I don't think so, sir.
You too, eh?
Kick a fellow when he's down, what?
Nobody would ever kick you, sir.
You've just got to change over, that's all.
Change over?
Well, a new job. It's easy enough for a man.
You think so, eh? Swap horses in midstream.
A lot of people have had to do it in this war, sir.
It's better than drowning. - Bravo, Angela.
I shall call you Johnny in future.
She's hit the nail on the head.
I don't know you.
You shouldn't give up so easily, my boy.
Is this the same man who took Berlin by storm 40 years ago?
Look at me.
Nobody wants me, but do I give up?
Nobody wants you and you're an expert.
I don't know anything but soldiering.
Not even that, apparently.
What about the Home Guard, sir?
They need leaders. They're becoming an army. - If we're invaded, they're our first defence.
There you are. You know everybody.
You could get them arms and instructors and equipment.
Oh, what a job.
Forming a new army.
Home Guard, eh?
Yes, sir.
I was going to tell you myself, sir.
You're drunk, Murdoch.
Tell me what?
That I joined the Home Guard, sir.
You?
Yes, sir.
Anything wrong with the soup, sir?
How should anybody know if they haven't touched it?
Take it away, Lance Corporal Murdoch.
Sergeant Murdoch, sir.
What have you been doing, sir, all this time?
Nothing, you blockhead, except talk.
But watch now.
There's no place like home... Hello, what's this?
There you go, boys - tea.
Oi, missus. Two basins for me and my old china.
Get your skates on.
See this? Major General Clive Wynne-Candy.
Blimey, what a moniker.
Fill it up. Removed to Royal Bathers' Club, Piccadilly.
He'd need a bath after this.
Good luck to the old bustard.
Still here? - Just off, General.
Don't be late.
No, sir. - What's that?
A gun, sir. Brother's a gamekeeper.
That's the ticket. Load with N0.4.
We'll soon have Tommy guns.
Know which end is which?
Oh, yes, sir.
Break it up, chaps.
By Gad, we'll have the proper weapons or I'll know the reason why.
I won't leave that damned doorstep. I'll make a stay-in stroke or a sit-down strike, or whatever it is.
We'll show 'em, Angela, eh?
A real army, eh?
The men are all right. Keen as mustard.
Organisation, general staff, offices, general headquarters - that's what we want and, by Gad, we'll get them!
Do you hear, Angela?
Yes, sir.
Give me one year. Six months.
I'll show 'em.
Take the afternoon off.
Thank you, sir.
Club, 7:30.
Very good, sir.
Point to the throat, my boy.
Gentlemen, this is der Tag, what?
The most vital and comprehensive exercise in which the Home Guard have taken part.
Defence of London. We've trained for it, we can tackle it.
We'll put up a good show, eh?
We will, sir.
We'll show these youngsters there's life in the old dog yet.
Gentlemen, war starts at midnight.
Five minutes easy, Sergeant.
Tea for two.
N0.9, doctor's favourite.
Got to go in a minute.
Why?
Got a job on.
Oh, you would have.
Come and have a look.
See that?
What, those trucks?
My private army.
Well, what about it?
Remember what you told me last night... amongst other things?
Yes, and I wish I hadn't told you.
Why do you think I wanted the lowdown on Sugar Candy's movements?
Why did you?
What's the mystery?
We're off to see him.
Who?
The wizard.
What for?
Because of the wonderful things he does, ta-ra da da-da da da-da!
Shut up, Spud.
What do you mean? - We're going to teach him total war.
How?
Capture him.
War starts at midnight, but we'll bag him hours before that.
Nazi methods, you know.
You're not a Nazi.
We're not training to fight Englishmen.
You can't!
Watch me. - I won't let you. He's a dear old man.
So will I be when I'm over 100.
But, Spud, how can you do it?
I know what it would mean to him.
Within an hour, the Wizard will be the captive of my bow and spear, not to mention the toughest troops between here and New Zealand.
Drink up. Spud, I gave you the information and it's mean to take advantage of it!
Don't be a sissy. In war, anything goes!
Oh, no, you don't.
Here, stop that.
Oh, darling.
Oh, Mr... Mr Marshall!
Spud!
Spud.
Come on, sir, what happened?
She got me.
Who?
Mata Hari.
Come on, quick.
Any luck?
Not a hope. She's halfway to London by now.
She's gone to warn the Wizard.
Get my tin hat.
Get after her, quick!
Who's going to pay for the tea?
Mr Marshall!
It's impossible.
Get him on the phone.
But, miss...
Very good.
Come on, Section.
Yes, sir. His driver wishes to speak to General Wynne-Candy.
Yes, it's...
Is General Wynne-Candy here?
No, sir. - Get General Wynne-Candy. - He left an hour ago.
Where was he going?
What is your business with him?
I have a message for him.
Give it to me.
I'll see he gets it. - Damn it, man.
Are you a Home Guard?
Why, sir?
The password is Veuve Clicquot 1911.
The General and his staff are in the Turkish baths.
Hawkins, you're in charge.
Don't leave your desk. You're a prisoner.
War doesnt start till midnight.
That's what you think. - Sergeant, that girl under there.
She's a prisoner too.
All right, boys, this is it.
Brute force and ruddy ignorance.
Hello? Hello?
Hello?
Well, warn him, then.
Can't you understand English?
Tell him to hide.
Gentlemen, the war will soon be over.
We agree, it's very fine to win the last battle.
We much prefer to win the first.
You will be kept prisoner in this building till 6 a.m.
It's all right, sir, he's still there.
Hello, Clive.
I'm glad you've come.
I couldn't have stood anybody else.
Oh, that's all right.
You've heard, I suppose.
Johnny told me.
And?
Well, I think it is a dirty trick, but...
I can't help finding it a bit funny too.
It is. That's the worst of it.
What do you think is going to happen now?
Officially, this fellow would be brought up before a court of inquiry and the exercise repeated some other time.
Will there be an inquiry, sir?
No, there won't. I'll see to that.
Where is he now?
Spud, sir?
He's with his men.
They're marching into London.
Did you see them?
Yes, we saw them when we came across the Cromwell Road.
The whole army. With bands.
How did they look, eh?
Well, Clive, I must say they...
They cleaned up my place rather nicely.
They built an emergency water tank there too, sir.
I've been thinking this over all night.
I don't want to get this young fellow into trouble.
I think I'll invite him to dinner instead.
Wasn't I just as much of a young fool as he is?
Of course I was.
But I wonder if he's going to be such a grand old man as you are.
When I was a young chap I was all gas and gaiters with no experience worth a damn.
Now, tons of experience and nobody thinks I'm any use.
I remember when I got back from Berlin in '02.
Old Betteridge gave me the worst wigging I ever had.
And then he invited me to dinner.
I didn't accept.
Often wish I had.
Yes, I think I will invite him to dinner.
And he'd better accept, you hear?
Here they come.
You'll stayjust as you are till the floods come.
Till the floods come.
And this is a lake.
And this is a lake.
Now here is the lake and I still haven't changed.
Sir?
Come in.
Mr. Spencer. Mr. Spencer, I hate to bother you, but I thought you'd like to know there were two men here.
Two men asking for you, a young man and a kind of older man.
They was sorry you wasn't in. I said you wasn't.
Did they say they'd be back?
They didn't say exactly, but I think they will.
Just now, when I had to go down to the store, I seen them standing there at the corner.
Maybe I should've let them in, only you said not to disturb you...
Yes?
And I'm sure they'll be back.
You look kind of tired to me, and that's a fact.
You got a headache or something?
I think maybe you need a real rest. That's what I think.
Why, Mr. Spencer, you oughtn't to leave all that money lying around like that.
Oh, it makes me nervous to see money lying around.
Everybody in the world ain't honest, you know.
Though I must say, I haven't had much trouble that way.
Those friends of yours told me not to mention they'd called.
Wanted to surprise you.
But I thought you'd like to know somehow.
Yes, yes. Of course. If they come back, you may show them in.
Yes.
You know, Mrs. Martin, it's very funny.
They aren't exactly friends of mine.
They've never seen me.
That's odd, isn't it?
It is odd, like you say.
And now that I'm here, I'll have to meet them.
I may even go out and meet them.
Then again, I may not.
Not yet.
You go ahead with your nap.
I'll pull down the blind.
What do you know?
You're bluffing.
You've nothing on me.
Hello, Postal Union?
I want to send a telegram to Mrs. Joseph Newton in Santa Rosa, California.
Here's the message. Ready?
Lonesome for you all.
Stop.
Am coming out to stay with you awhile.
Stop.
Will arrive Thursday, and try and stop me.
Will wire exact time later.
Love to you all, and a kiss for little Charlie from her Uncle Charlie.
That's right. That's the signature.
Uncle Charlie."
That's right.
Santa Rosa.
Santa Rosa, California.
Ann!
Ann, answer the telephone.
Newtons' residence.
Ann Newton speaking.
Oh, hello, Mrs. Henderson.
This is Ann.
Mother isn't home yet.
A telegram?
Well...
I don't see a pencil, so maybe she better call you back.
I'm trying to keep my mind free of things that don't matter, because I have so much to keep on my mind.
Innumerable things.
I'll have her call back.
Thank you for calling.
Goodbye.
Hello, Ann.
Where's your mother?
She's out. - Out?
Mrs. Henderson just called from the Postal Union Office.
She says we have a telegram.
I would have taken it down, only I couldn't find a pencil.
I looked.
Telegram, eh?
I knew there'd be trouble if your Aunt Sarah got her driver's license.
Whereabouts was the accident?
I didn't take notes.
Oh. Then how about a kiss?
Isn't that the funniest thing?
Here I am, practically a child, and I wouldn't read the things you read.
Well, I guess they'd give you bad dreams. Bad dreams?
You don't understand, Papa.
Mystery stories have done...
Where's Roger? - Out.
The average mind...
Where's Charlie? - Out.
No, I mean she's upstairs in her room thinking.
Well, don't read too much.
You'll ruin your eyes.
And leave my book alone.
What's that you're reading?
Ivanhoe.
Hmm?
Who is it?
It's me.
What's the matter?
Don't you feel well?
I'm perfectly well.
I've just been thinking for hours, and I've come to the conclusion that I give up.
I simply give up.
What are you going to give up?
Have you ever stopped to think that a family should be the most wonderful thing in the world?
And that this family has just gone to pieces?
We have?
Of course we have.
We just sort of go along and nothing happens.
We're in a terrible rut.
It's been on my mind for months.
What's going to be our future?
Oh, come now, Charlie. Things aren't as bad as that.
The bank gave me a raise last January.
Money.
How can you talk about money when I'm talking about souls?
We eat and sleep, and that's about all.
We don't even have any real conversations.
We just talk.
And work. Yes.
Poor Mother.
She works like a dog.
Just like a dog.
Where is she?
She's out.
When she comes back, it'll be the same thing.
Dinner, then dishes, then bed.
I don't see how she stands it.
You know, she's really a wonderful woman.
I mean, she's not just a mother.
And I think we ought to do something for her.
Don't you think we should? Yeah.
What were you thinking of doing for her?
Oh, nothing, I suppose.
I guess we'll just have to wait for a miracle or something.
Oh, now, Charlie, you're right. Absolutely right.
I'll figure out some way...
Oh, I don't believe in good intentions anymore.
All I'm waiting for now is a miracle.
Oh, Charlie.
Those back stairs are steep.
What's the matter, Charlie?
What's the matter, Joe?
Well, it seems that...
Oh, I've become a nagging old maid.
And you went downtown in that awful old hat you promised me you'd throw away. - Darling, what does it matter what hat I put on? - Mama.
Mama.
Mother, I don't see why you let that child yell at you like that.
She's...
I'm going downstairs anyway.
Joe, what were you both talking about when I came in?
Something about a miracle?
Oh, it's nothing.
Charlie's a bit under the weather.
Well, she'll be all right.
Well, come on, dear. Let's go downstairs. No use standing here.
I'm going to get myself a bottle of beer.
Mother, I'm going downtown and send a telegram.
Why, darling, who do you know to send a telegram to?
I know a wonderful person who'll come and shake us all up.
Just the one to save us.
Have you gone crazy? What do you mean, "Save us"?
All this time, there's been one right person to save us.
Mother, what's Uncle Charlie's address?
Uncle Charlie?
Now, you're not going to ask him for money, are you?
Of course not.
That wouldn't help us. What's his address?
Well, the last address...
Do you know how many steps I had to take to get from here to the drugstore and back?
649.
No. If you've forgotten, I'm not going to tell you.
I remember. Philadelphia.
But, darling, you can't ask a busy man like that to come all this way for nothing.
He'll come for me. I'm named after him.
Besides, we're the only relatives he has in the world.
If you come all the way up Fourth Street, it's 802.
Mama, guess what?
I have no time for guessing.
What's that thing in your hair?
Well, I'll tell you anyway, even though I think it's nicer when people guess.
Mrs. Henderson said to call her at the telegraph office, 'cause she says we have a telegram.
Ann, I don't think you ought to put things behind your ears.
Something might get into your ear.
Emmy, Ann says we have a telegram.
I think you ought to find out about it.
Somebody might be sick or something.
Mrs. Henderson didn't read the telegram... Did you say telegram for me? because I couldn't find a pencil.
When I have a house of my own, it's going to be full of well-sharpened pencils.
Did Mrs. Henderson say who the telegram was from?
No, she didn't.
I think that's funny. I think she might have said who it was from.
Come on, Ann. That's my chair.
I'll call up and find out.
If you all be quiet... Just a second.
Hello. 181, please.
I wonder who it can be.
Oh, nothing, Operator. Just 181.
If that's from my sister...
Hello?
Mrs. Henderson?
This is Emma Newton.
Ann says you have a telegram for me.
Mama, you don't have to shout. - Shh.
Really, Papa. You'd think Mama had never seen a phone.
She makes no allowance for science.
She thinks she has to cover the distance by sheer lung power.
Why, how wonderful.
Thursday, you say?
Looks like somebody's coming.
Who's coming, Ma?
Well, it's the most wonderful surprise.
It's my brother, you know.
My younger brother.
Yes, of course, a little spoiled. You know how families always spoil the youngest.
Well, it's just simply wonderful.
Thanks most awfully, Mrs. Henderson.
Well.
What do you think?
Charles is coming.
Who? - Who?
Your Uncle Charlie.
Did you say "Charles"?
And our Charlie's gone to send him a telegram.
Now, what made her think to do that at the same time? And now Charlie's gone.
Hello, Charlie. I just called up your house.
Telegram for your mother. Did you?
Gonna send that by Bill Forest, but you can take it.
Thanks.
From your uncle, it's the spoiled one.
My uncle?
My Uncle Charlie?
Yeah.
Mrs. Henderson, do you believe in telepathy?
Well, I ought to. That's my business.
Oh, not telegraphy. Mental telepathy.
Like...
Well, suppose you have a thought, and suppose the thought is about someone you're in tune with.
And then across thousands of miles, that person knows what you're thinking about and answers you.
And it's all mental.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I only send telegrams the normal way.
He heard me. He heard me.
Mr. Otis?
Mr. Otis?
Yes?
You're almost in Santa Rosa.
Want to be ready when you get into Santa Rosa.
I'm ready now. Thanks.
Then I'll get all your bags out for you, then.
How you feeling, Mr. Otis?
Pretty well.
A little weak, but pretty well on the whole.
Mmm-hmm.
Harry, tell the porter you're a doctor.
Ask if there's anything you can do. Maybe you can help that poor soul.
Listen, I'm on my vacation.
Porter, my husband's a doctor and if there's anything...
No, ma'am. He's a very sick man. Won't see anyone.
I haven't set eyes on him myself since we first got on the train.
Well, you don't look very well either.
Here we are.
Come on, children.
Close the door, there. That's right.
Oh, are you...
Charlie. Young Charlie.
At first, I didn't know you. I thought you were sick.
Sick?
You aren't sick, are you?
Look, Pop!
Here he is!
Why, Uncle Charlie, you're not sick. That was the funniest thing. Sick?
Me, sick? Well, Joe, how are you?
Haven't changed a bit.
All right, Charles.
You're looking great. Roger.
Hello, Ann.
I bet you don't remember me.
I remember you sort of. You look different.
Well, we better get started. Emma's got the dinner almost ready.
I couldn't persuade her to come to the station. Dinner came first.
Come on, Roger, get the bags. - All right, Charles, I'll take that.
Thank you, Joe. That's it.
Come on. Let's go.
Come on there, Roger, and get these bags in.
You sure that isn't too heavy for you?
Oh, no. It's nothing. I love to carry.
Emma. Don't move.
Standing there, you don't look like Emma Newton.
You look like Emma Spencer Oakley of 46 Burnham Street, St. Paul, Minnesota.
The prettiest girl on the block."
Charles!
Charlie. - Mama, nobody got off the train but Uncle Charlie.
Let me look at you.
We were the only ones who met somebody.
There was only one bed still made up.
To think you could take the time off.
Oh, Charles, it's so wonderful to have you here.
Emmy, Emmy, don't cry.
And imagine your thinking of 46 Burnham Street.
I haven't thought of that funny old street in years.
I keep remembering those things. All the old things.
Well, Emmy, how's he look to you?
Same old Charles, eh?
Roger, Ann, get these other bags.
You have Charlie's room right here at the head of the stairs.
Emmy wanted to move Ann, but Charlie thought you'd be more comfortable here.
Come on, Roger.
Don't put the hat on the bed.
Superstitious, Joe?
No, but I don't believe in inviting trouble.
It wasn't the biggest yacht in the world, but it had a nice little fireplace in the library, and the bar was paneled in bleached mahogany.
You pushed a button and...
What am I talking about? That's all over.
Let's talk about you.
Charlie, that's the prettiest dress I ever saw.
I think so, too.
Why, Charles, don't you remember?
Remember? Remember what?
Why, Uncle Charlie, you sent it to me.
I did?
Well, say, I've been sitting here all this time forgetting something.
Ann.
Roger.
Look at that. Oh, dear now. - Joe.
Don't know whether you had one or not.
You didn't have to think of me, Charles. Presents for the children are all right.
Say...
I've never had a wristwatch.
Fellows at the bank will think I'm quite a sport.
I have two for you, Emmy, one old and one new.
Oh, Charles. What is it?
You shouldn't have.
Really. No. - Oh, yes.
Oh, Charles.
Oh, how beautiful.
Oh, I've always wanted one.
Oh, Mother, it's exactly right. It's what you should have.
Look, Emmy.
Charles.
You've had these all along.
Mmm-hmm. All along, Emmy. All these years.
Safe in a deposit box. No matter where I was.
Grandpa and Grandma?
1888.
Fifty-three years ago.
Aren't they sweet?
My, she was pretty.
Everybody was sweet and pretty then, Charlie.
The whole world.
A wonderful world.
Not like the world today.
Not like the world now.
It was great to be young then.
We're all happy now, Uncle Charlie.
Look at us.
For once, we're all happy at the same time.
Now for your present, Charlie.
Oh, I don't want anything.
Right now, I have enough.
Before you came, I didn't think I had anything, but now I don't want another thing.
She's crazy.
She doesn't mean it. Really.
If you ask me, I think she's putting on, like girls in books.
The ones that say they don't want anything always get more in the end.
That's what she's hoping.
She's not crazy.
The smartest girl in her class at school.
Won the debate against the East Richmond High School single-handed.
She's got brains.
I meant it.
Please don't give me anything.
Nothing?
Oh, I can't explain it.
But you came here, and Mother's so happy and...
Oh, I'm glad that she named me after you and that she thinks we're both alike.
I think we are, too. I know it.
Oh, it would spoil things if you should give me anything.
You're a strange girl, Charlie.
Why would it spoil things?
Because we're not just an uncle and a niece.
It's something else.
I know you.
I know that you don't tell people a lot of things.
I don't either.
I have a feeling that inside you somewhere, there's something nobody knows about.
Something nobody knows?
Something secret and wonderful and...
I'll find it out.
It's not good to find out too much, Charlie.
But we're sort of like twins. Don't you see?
We have to know.
Give me your hand, Charlie.
Thank you.
You didn't even look at it.
I don't have to look at it.
No matter what you gave me, it'd be the same.
Here. Let me show you.
It's a good emerald.
A really good one.
Good emeralds are the most beautiful things in the world.
You've had something engraved on it that's different.
I haven't, but I will if you like it.
Yes, you have, Uncle Charlie. It's very faint.
T.S. from B.M."
Why, it must be someone's initials.
Well, I've been rooked. The jeweler rooked me.
Oh, it doesn't matter. Really.
Give it back. I'll have it taken off.
No, no. I like it this way.
Someone else was probably happy with this ring.
Oh, it's perfect the way it is.
You bring the coffee.
Sing at the table, you'll marry a crazy husband.
Superstitions have been proved 100% wrong.
Yes, I've been thinking of transferring some money out here from the east.
I could put it in your bank, Joe, until I found out what's what.
I suppose your bank does take money, huh?
That's one thing we do, all right. Rake in the dough.
Can't promise to give it back.
Well, I think I'll go downtown in the morning and open an account at, say, 30 or $40,000, just to start things off right?
That's a lot of money.
He won't have it long. The government will get it.
The government gets...
You're not to talk against the government, Roger.
My goodness. The way men do things.
I can't get that tune out of my head.
Maybe if somebody tells me what it is, I'll forget it.
It's a waltz.
I know it is, but what one?
You know, it's the funniest thing.
Sometimes I get a tune in my head like that and, pretty soon, I hear somebody else humming it, too.
I think tunes jump from head to head.
Do you know what it is, Uncle Charlie?
No, no. I don't know what it is.
I remember. Uh...
It's on the tip of my tongue.
It's a waltz, and it's Victor Herbert.
Victor Herbert wasn't a waltz. - He was...
It's the Blue Danube waltz.
Oh, yes. Of course it is.
No, it isn't, Uncle Charlie. I know what it is. It's the Merry...
I'm terribly sorry, Emmy.
Nothing to make a fuss over.
Charles, while we do the dishes, why don't you come in the living room and stretch out on the sofa and read the evening paper?
You never were much on helping.
Joe, here's Herbert.
Ann, Roger. Help me clear the table.
Herbert's a friend of Joe's.
They're literary critics.
Hello, Herb. Had your supper?
Had mine an hour ago.
Hour ago, huh?
Oh, a watch. - Yeah.
A present.
Herb, I'd like you to meet my brother-in-law.
Charles, this is Herb Hawkins.
Nice to know you, Mr. Hawkins.
Fine, thank you.
How's your mother, Herb?
Oh, just middling.
Uh-huh.
Excuse me, Herb.
Thank you.
I'm sorry your mother's not better.
Thank you, dear. - Oh, yeah. - There, now.
Thank you.
Lead a life of luxury.
Well, I must go and see what Charlie's doing.
Wife's brother from the east.
New York man.
Good for the children.
You know what I mean?
In business?
Well, he takes himself very seriously.
Well, how's everything?
Say, have you read this one?
Huh?
That little Frenchman beats them all.
You can talk all you like about Sherlock Holmes.
That little Frenchman beats them all.
I read it.
Air bubbles don't necessarily kill a person.
Those writers from the other side get too fancy.
The best way to commit a murder...
I know. I know.
Hit them on the head with a blunt instrument.
Well, it's true, isn't it? Listen.
If I wanted to murder you tomorrow, do you think I'd waste my time on fancy hypodermics?
Or on inee?
What's that?
Inee.
Indian arrow poison.
Listen.
I'd find out if you were alone, walk in, hit you on the head with a piece of lead pipe or a loaded cane...
What'd be the fun of that?
Where's your planning?
Where's your clues?
I don't want any clues. I want to murder you.
What do I want with clues?
Well, if you haven't got any clues, where's your book?
I'm not talking about writing books. I'm talking about killing you!
If I was going to kill you, I wouldn't do a dumb thing like hitting you on the head.
First of all, I don't like the fingerprint angle.
Of course, I could always wear gloves, press your hands against the pipe after you were dead, and make you look like a suicide.
Except it don't seem hardly likely that you'd beat yourself to death with a club.
I'd murder you so it didn't look like murder.
Oh, Ann?
What?
Come here.
Did you ever see a house made out of newspapers?
Hold on.
You take one sheet here.
Okay?
And you tear it down here.
And you tear it there.
And you fold it over here, the side.
Fold over the other side here.
And turn it up there.
Now the door.
Right off...
And there.
I'm not a baby anymore.
Besides, that's Papa's paper.
Oh, Roger, look what we've got.
A nice, little red barn.
You've got Papa's paper.
Oh, that's all right.
Simply unfold it.
Nobody will ever know the difference.
What are you two doing?
You know that's your father's paper.
Oh, it's my fault, Charlie. I was showing them a little game.
Didn't think about it being Joe's paper.
Oh, that's all right.
Here's page one, five, eight...
What'd you do with page three and four?
We never touched it. Really.
Uncle Charlie's the only one that touched it.
Oh, well.
I guess it's all right.
If I fold it very neatly, maybe he won't notice.
Come in.
I brought you water.
Oh, thank you, Charlie. That's very thoughtful of you.
Pleasant dreams.
Uncle Charlie, I know a secret about you, you don't think I know.
What secret?
Well, remember I said you couldn't hide anything from me because I'd find it out?
Well, now I know there was something in the evening paper about you.
About me in the evening paper?
About you. And that's why you played that game with Ann and Roger.
You didn't want us to know and you wanted to tear the paper. Now I know.
You might as well tell me.
Well, you've got me there, Charlie.
Only it wasn't about me.
It was about someone I used to know.
There!
It's none of your business.
Uncle Charlie, you're hurting me.
Oh, Charlie.
Your hands.
Charlie, I didn't mean to hurt you.
I was just fooling.
It was nothing.
Just some gossip.
Not very pretty about someone I once met up with.
Not for you to read.
Forget it.
Good night, young Charlie.
Good night, Uncle Charlie.
Pleasant dreams.
How long is Uncle Charlie going to stay here?
Forever, I hope.
Hasn't he got a house of his own?
Not that I mind you in here, but I never can tell when I'll want some privacy.
You better go to sleep, baby.
You said your prayers?
I forgot.
You better say them.
I lay me down to sleep, I pray the Lord my soul to keep...
Don't bless too many people. It's late.
I pray the Lord my soul to take.
God bless Mama, Papa, Captain Midnight, Veronica Lake, and the President of the United States.
You can't say them all tonight, dear.
Oh, and Uncle Charlie.
All ready for breakfast?
Oh, coffee.
'Cause I don't know how you do it. Now, I'm never comfortable eating in bed.
Of course, I've had to have my meals in bed for a while after the children came, but I never liked it.
I can't face the world in the morning. I must have coffee before I can speak.
Well, I don't mind pampering you your first morning, but I think you're the only person in this town to have breakfast at 10:30.
And while you were sleeping, the newspaper called up for an interview.
With me? - Mmm-hmm.
And the women's club I belong to wants you to give them a little talk.
Women's club.
Oh!
Oh, you haven't finished unpacking. - I'll do that for you. - Where's Charlie?
She's running around the house as though she'd lost her mind.
She thinks everything needs fixing.
But what I wanted to tell you was that you are not the only celebrity in this town.
The whole Newton family is going to be in the limelight.
What are you cooking up?
Well, a young man called this morning, said his name was Graham, and he wants to interview everybody in this house.
Interview everybody?
That's what he said.
He's being sent around the country by some kind of institute or committee or something.
He has to pick representative American families and ask them questions.
It's a kind of a poll.
It's called the National Public Survey.
Wonder how he happened to pick this family?
Well, he said he wanted a typical American family.
I told him we weren't a typical American family.
Well, if he's going to ask a lot of questions, he can leave me out of it.
Oh, but you could tell him so much more than any of us could.
He's going to take our pictures, too.
Pictures.
My. Isn't that lovely?
You see, there were really two young men.
One of them takes the pictures.
Oh, there were two.
Yes. Mr. Graham was the nicest.
Oh, he doesn't want us to dress up or anything.
He just wants us to act the way we always do.
Emmy, women are fools. They'd fall for anything.
Why do you let two strangers come into your house and turn the place upside down?
Why expose the family to a couple of snoopers?
You ought to have better sense.
Why, Charles, I...
Good morning, Uncle Charlie.
Good morning, Charlie.
Your mother's been telling me about the Newtons being picked for All-American suckers.
What do you know about it?
Oh, Charlie wasn't here when they came.
But really, Charles, the way Mr. Graham told it, it wasn't like snooping at all.
It was our duty as citizens. It's something the government wants.
Government?
Maybe not exactly, but it's for the public good.
When I told them about you and all the places you've been, he was really interested.
Now, listen, Emmy. I'll have nothing to do with this.
I'm just a visitor here, and my advice to you is to slam the door in his face.
Well, I couldn't do that.
But you don't have to meet him if you don't want to.
Well, I think I'd be kind of exciting.
He'd take your photograph, and then we could have it for nothing.
I've never been photographed in my life, and I don't want to be.
Oh, Charles, how can you talk that way?
I had a photograph of you. I gave it to Charlie.
I tell you, there are none.
I guess you've forgotten this one.
Get it, Charlie.
You sure you don't remember?
Of course I don't ever remember being photographed.
46 Burnham Street.
Mmm-hmm.
It was taken the Christmas you got your bicycle.
Just before your accident.
Uncle Charlie, you were beautiful.
Wasn't he, though?
And such a quiet boy. Always reading.
I always said Papa never should've bought you that bicycle. You didn't know how to handle it.
Charlie, he took it right out on the icy road and skidded into a streetcar.
We thought he was going to die.
I'm glad he didn't.
Well, he almost did.
He fractured his skull, and he was laid up so long.
And then, when he was getting well, there was no holding him.
It was just as though all the rest he had was, well, too much for him, and he had to get into mischief to blow off steam.
He didn't do much reading after that, let me tell you.
It was taken the very day he had his accident.
And then a few days later, when the pictures came home, how Mama cried.
She wondered if he'd ever look the same.
She wondered if he'd ever be the same.
What's the use of looking backward?
What's the use of looking ahead?
Today's the thing.
That's my philosophy.
Today.
Well, if today's the thing, then you'd better finish your breakfast and get down to the bank because Joe'll be waiting.
And, Charlie, don't be late back because the questionnaire men are coming at 4:00.
Good morning, Charlie.
Hello, Madge.
Good morning, Charlie.
Hello, Catherine.
Did you see the way they looked at you?
I bet they wonder who you are.
Oh, Uncle Charlie, I love to walk with you.
I want everybody to see you.
There's Papa in that window over there.
Hello, Joe.
Can you stop embezzling a minute and give me your attention?
Charles, we don't joke about such things here.
Oh, what's a little shortage in the books at the end of the month?
Any good bank clerk can cover up a little shortage. Isn't that right, Charlie?
Uncle Charlie, you're awful. Everyone can hear you.
Good thing they can, we all know what banks are.
Look all right to an outsider, but no one knows what goes on when the doors are locked.
Can't fool me, though.
Well, Joe, let's see your president.
Still want to open that account, Charles?
That's why I'm here.
Well, you wait right here, and I'll see if Mr. Greene's busy.
And, Charles, he doesn't care much for jokes about banks.
Well, $40,000 is no joke. Not to him, I bet.
It's a joke to me.
The whole world's a joke to me.
I'll be right back.
You shouldn't tease Papa like that.
I wasn't teasing him.
I just hate this stuffy atmosphere.
They're waving for us to come in.
Hello, Mr. Greene.
Hello, Charlie.
Mr. Greene, this is my brother-in-law, Mr. Oakley.
How do you do?
How are you, Mr. Oakley?
Well, Mr. Greene, I was thinking of settling down here for awhile.
Great country. Great country.
We think so. What have you been doing, Mr. Oakley?
Well, I suppose you might call me a promoter.
I've done a little bit of everything.
The only trouble I find is that once I make the money, I'm not interested in it.
Not interested in money?
You know as well as I do there's plenty of money lying around waiting for somebody to pick it up.
I thought maybe I'd put some of my loose cash away for safekeeping.
Naturally, I thought of the bank where Joe works.
Loose cash?
Well, I got in a habit of carrying a lot of cash with me when I was traveling.
A dangerous habit, Mr. Oakley.
Never lost a penny in my life, Mr. Greene.
I guess heaven takes care of fools and scoundrels.
Yes.
Thirty, 35, 40... $40,000.
Shall we start with 40?
If you'll just write out a deposit slip, Mr. Oakley.
Ah, details.
I'm glad to see that you're a man who understands details, Mr. Greene.
They're most important to me.
Most important.
All the little details.
Oh, dear. I'm sorry. I didn't know you were busy.
We can come back.
Come in, now that you're here. Come in.
Mrs. Greene, I'd like you to meet my uncle, Mr. Oakley.
Uncle Charlie, this is Mrs. Greene and Mrs. Potter.
Mrs. Greene, Miss Potter.
Mrs. Potter.
Oh, and there was something about you that made me think that...
Yes?
What did you want, Margaret?
Well, we were going shopping and I only have five dollars, so I...
There's one good thing in being a widow, isn't there?
You don't have to ask your husband for money. Here you are.
Oh, thank you.
Good-bye, Mr. Oakley.
Mrs. Potter.
Bye, Mrs. Greene.
There. There you are, Mr. Greene.
Charlie, let's see the town and have some lunch.
Good-bye, Mr. Oakley.
Bye, Mr. Greene.
Call on us for advice anytime.
Thank you.
Joe, you may see Mr. Oakley to the door.
Joe, keep your eyes open. You'll have his job in a couple of years.
Here he is.
Those must be the questionnaire men.
They're a whole hour early.
I won't see them.
Don't worry. You don't have to if you don't want to. I'll see that you don't.
The way they got around your mother.
I thought she'd have better sense.
How do you do?
How do you do?
You must be the men who want to interview us.
My name is Graham, Miss Newton.
How do you do?
And this is Fred Saunders.
How do you do?
Won't you come in?
I'll call my mother.
Thank you.
Mother, the government men are here.
Will you sit down?
But you said 4:00. Nothing's ready now.
My husband is still at the bank and the house is...
That's all we want now, Mrs. Newton. Some pictures of the house.
Saunders can get busy, and I'd like to ask a few questions, if you don't mind.
Well, all right, but I do wish you'd waited until I had the house looking its best.
I wanted to have flowers around and fresh curtains in the kitchen.
And there are a lot of things I don't want you to photograph.
I believe you told me you owned the house?
Own it?
It owns us.
It seems to me no sooner do I get one thing fixed, then something else gets broken.
And then it needs fresh paint and the...
Mr. Saunders, I'm very sorry, but you simply cannot take a picture with that chair in it.
It needs a new slipcover.
And there are six in your family?
Five.
Five? But...
Well, my uncle's just visiting.
I told you about him. He's here from the east on a little visit.
Just put down five, because my uncle doesn't want to be bothered with a lot of questions.
Well, you see, on a survey, we usually...
He's not interested in the survey, and I promised him he wouldn't be bothered.
Well, we'd like it if we could get all of you.
You know, your opinions, what you do, or what you want to do.
My uncle's opinions aren't average, and I'm afraid they wouldn't help you a bit.
Besides, I think when someone asks for privacy, they should have it.
Well, we'll...
The whole idea of this thing is that...
Mr. Graham, perhaps you'd better choose another family.
We'll do anything you say, of course, but this family seemed right and...
It is a nice family.
Charlie, why don't you let the young men go ahead, so long as they're here?
Well, all right.
Okay. Saunders, go ahead and get another shot.
Mrs. Newton, perhaps you could tell me what clubs and organizations you and your husband belong to.
How about a picture in the kitchen?
Well, I'm afraid the kitchen isn't quite the way I'd like it.
Come along.
Now, if you'll start by breaking an egg, Mrs. Newton.
Oh, but you don't start a cake by breaking an egg.
You have to put the butter and sugar in first.
You see, after all, survey or no survey, I'm not going to start by breaking an egg.
I thought I'd make a maple cake. My brother Charles loves maple cake.
What does your brother do, Mrs. Newton?
Oh, I guess he just does about everything.
Oh, you mean, what does he do?
Oh, he's just in business. You know, the way men are.
My husband now, he works in a bank, but I think Charles is just in business.
Mr. Saunders, if you really want a picture of me breaking an egg, you'll have to wait till I cream the butter and sugar.
I'll wait.
I wonder if we could take a look at the upstairs?
Could you show us, and your mother can call us when she's ready?
All right.
If you'd rather wait, Mr. Saunders, you see, folding in the eggs has to be done just right.
I can't beat them and let them stand.
The minute I hear you've broken the eggs, I'll come right down, Mrs. Newton.
Yes.
I really don't see what you want to look up here for.
Whose room is that?
It's mine. My uncle's using it now, though.
I'd like to get an idea what your room looks like.
Typical girl, typical room.
Typical of you to ask.
My uncle's resting.
I really don't want to disturb him.
Is there a back stairs?
Mmm-hmm. Right down the hall.
I'll bet you 50 cents that your uncle isn't in there.
Oh, betting's silly.
All you want to do is photograph my room. Doesn't he, Mr. Saunders?
That's it.
Besides, I know my uncle's in there.
All right, I'll still bet he isn't. Let me knock and see.
I'll knock.
Uncle Charlie?
Uncle Charlie, may we come in?
See?
You were right.
Nice room.
Do you mind if I take a picture or two since he isn't here?
I certainly don't want to disturb your uncle.
Oh, I suppose so.
But I really can't imagine anyone being interested in my room.
It's not at all the way I'd like it. I'd like to have it all white. Yellow and white.
Might as well let him work in peace.
Besides, I'd like to talk to you.
You know, your picking us as an average family kind of gave me a funny feeling.
What kind of a funny feeling?
Oh, I don't know.
I guess I don't like to be an average girl in an average family.
Average families are the best. Look at me.
I'm from an average family.
As average as ours?
Sure.
Besides, I don't think you're average.
Oh, that's because you seeing me now instead of a few days ago.
I was in the dumps, and then Uncle Charlie came and everything changed.
But your mother said he only got here last night. Maybe you just think that...
I don't think. I know.
It's funny, but when I try to think of how I feel,
Are you trying to tell me I shouldn't think he's so wonderful?
Oh, no. I...
Mr. Saunders?
I'm ready with the eggs.
I hope Mr. Saunders doesn't move anything in there.
My uncle's awfully neat and fussy.
Saunders is neat and fussy, too.
Is this your uncle you were telling us about?
Yes, it is.
Now, for one of the hall.
Mr. Saunders has been taking pictures of my room.
My sister told me to remind you something about eggs and a cake.
I don't like to be photographed. I'm afraid I'll have to ask you for the film.
Oh, Uncle Charlie.
Give it to me, please.
Give it to him, Fred.
That's too bad.
There's a picture of Mrs. Newton on this film.
Excuse me.
Mr. Saunders, I'm ready to fold in the eggs.
I can't let them stand another minute.
That was my last roll of film.
Mr. Saunders took Uncle Charlie's picture by mistake, and Uncle Charlie made him give him back the roll.
I guess he wasn't joking about not wanting to be photographed.
We didn't want to start a family feud.
I'll get you making the cake again tomorrow, Mrs. Newton.
Mr. Saunders, I won't be making a cake again tomorrow.
Now, I want to help with an important work, but I cannot go on making cakes.
You have helped, Mrs. Newton.
And now I'd like to ask another favor.
Could I borrow your daughter for this evening?
I'd like to look around the town a little.
Ann?
Charlie.
Ann would be better. Ann knows everything about everybody.
Charlie.
Well, if Charlie doesn't mind.
I don't mind.
Swell.
Good-bye, then, Mrs. Newton.
Good-bye.
6:30?
6:30.
Okay. Good-bye.
Bye.
Bye, Mr. Saunders.
Bye.
Good-bye.
He seems like a nice young man.
But I thought you were going to the movies with Catherine.
Oh, I'll tell her I don't feel well or something.
Hello, Charlie.
Well... Hello, Catherine. Hello, Shirley.
Hello.
This is Jack Graham.
He's in town.
How do you do? - How do you do?
Hello.
How's your throat, Charlie?
Oh, much better. Thank you.
Bill Forest was asking about you.
Bill Forest?
Well, good-bye.
Bye.
Good-bye.
I know what you are, really.
You're a detective.
There's something the matter, and you're a detective.
Charlie, listen.
I don't want to listen.
Why, you're not on a survey at all.
You lied to us. You lied to Mother.
You just wanted to get in our house.
Police.
That's what it is.
What do you want with us?
What are you doing around here, lying to us?
Look, Charlie, you've got to listen to me. You've got to trust me.
When you've done nothing but lie?
And you probably didn't want to take me out at all tonight, the way I thought you did.
You just wanted to ask me a lot of questions.
Have I asked you a lot of questions?
Have I?
All right, I'm a detective.
A pretty bad one.
Now, won't you even listen to me?
Why should I, when you lied to me?
I had to.
When I came here to this town to find a man, I hadn't counted on you.
I hadn't counted on your mother or your family.
Find a man? What man?
There's a man loose in this country.
We're after him.
We don't know much about him. We don't even know what he looks like.
Charlie, think.
How much do you know about your uncle?
Why, he's my mother's brother.
What's he got to do with it?
This man we want may be your uncle.
Oh, I don't believe you.
Go away and leave me alone.
We're after one man.
Your uncle may be that man.
We followed him, we think he is. But in the east, there's another man who's being hunted, too, hunted through Massachusetts and into Maine.
He may be the man.
My uncle hasn't done anything.
He knows it would kill my mother if he did.
He's her younger brother, just like Roger is mine.
Why don't they arrest that man in the east?
Why don't you go away and leave us alone?
Charlie, when we were eating tonight and talking about our folks, and what we'd done and how we felt, we were like two ordinary people, weren't we?
I mean, we both been brought up about the same.
You liked me. I know you did. And I liked you.
It doesn't matter now.
What do you mean, "It doesn't matter"?
It's the only thing that does matter.
If it weren't for you, you don't think I'd care how or when I caught up with your uncle, do you?
Because if he's the guy, I'm going to catch up with him, Charlie. Remember that.
And you're going to keep your mouth shut.
You're going to keep your mouth shut because you're a nice girl.
Because you're such a nice girl that you know you'd help me if you knew your uncle was the man we wanted.
I wouldn't help you.
And I know you would.
And I'm trying to make it easier for you.
If your uncle's the man we want, we'll get him out of town quietly.
We won't arrest him here.
Arrest him here in town?
With Mother?
I'm trying to tell you we won't.
Please, Charlie.
I won't say anything.
Oh, take me home!
Good night, Charlie.
It's going to be funny when you find out you're wrong.
Good night.
Hello, Charlie. Home already?
Oh, yes, Dad.
It's so nice out, I thought I'd get a breath of air before I went to bed.
Well, you better run in, now. Your Uncle Charlie's been asking about you.
I think I'll just go up the back way.
I'm tired and I don't feel like talking.
All right. Suit yourself.
Take care of yourself.
Mmm-hmm.
Good night, Herb.
Good night, Charlie.
Good night, Charlie.
What were we saying, Herb?
Did I notice what?
Well, did you taste anything funny about that coffee you had at my house this evening?
No. It tasted all right.
That's what I mean. It wasn't all right.
Put something in it?
Put a little soda.
About the same amount that I'd have used if I'd wanted to use poison.
Well, you don't say.
I never tasted a thing.
Of course, I might not notice the soda.
You'd notice the soda more than you would the poison.
For all you knew, you might just as well be dead now.
Aren't you asleep yet, Ann?
Mmm-mmm.
Charlotte, what are you doing?
Oh, I'm just looking for a recipe I thought I saw, but it's just so torn up...
They have papers in the library. New ones and old ones.
Miss Corcoran will get them out for you.
She won't even notice if you cut out a little, bitty recipe.
Oh, it's not that important.
What time does the library close?
If you read as much as you should, you'd know it closes at 9:00.
Oh, well. If I think about it, maybe I'll go tomorrow.
You really ought to go to sleep, Ann.
Get back there!
Get back! Get back!
Just a moment, Charlie.
What do you think I am out here for?
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Norton.
All right.
Miss Corcoran, please let me in!
Oh, please!
Oh, thank you.
Really, Charlie. You know as well as I do the library closes at 9:00.
If I make one exception, I'll have to make a thousand.
No, I'm sorry, Mrs. Corcoran, but there is something in the paper I've just got to see.
I'm surprised at you, Charlie. No consideration.
Oh, I'll only be a minute.
You've got all day, Charlie, to come here.
I don't know why you want to rush in here tonight like a madwoman.
I'll give you just three minutes.
Can't be anything really awful.
I'll prove to him it isn't.
Page three...
Hello.
Where's Charlie?
She's still asleep.
I don't want to wake her.
Charlie still asleep?
No, she just woke up.
Perhaps I shouldn't have let her sleep so long, but I think she needed it.
She doesn't look quite herself.
She'll be down for dinner.
Mother, let me finish mashing those.
I'll fix the rest of dinner and get it all on the table.
All right. - You go on and talk to Uncle Charlie.
How do you feel, darling?
I feel fine.
I must have been tired or something. I slept like a log.
Well, your Uncle Charlie was asking for you again. He's awfully fond of you.
And that nice young man came twice to ask after you.
I told him you were asleep and I didn't want to disturb you.
Well, I'm rested now and ready for anything.
Is the gravy made?
Now you're humming that waltz.
Whatever you do, please don't hum that tune anymore.
I've just got it out of my head, and I don't want it started again.
Please remember, don't hum that tune.
And don't keep getting up every few minutes.
You just sit there and be a real lady.
All right, if you say so, but at least I can carry in the soup.
Roger, wash your hands!
Joe. Charles. Dinner.
Mama.
What is it?
Ann, I told you not to put things behind your ears and don't pull at me.
And don't whisper.
When you whisper, anyone could hear you a block away.
May I sit by you at the table?
By me?
Why, I should think you'd want to sit by your Uncle Charlie.
No, I want to sit by you.
Why do you want to change?
Mother, let her change with Roger if she wants to.
I asked Roger, he doesn't mind.
No, certainly not. Uncle Charlie might think...
No, certainly not.
Mother, let her change if she wants to.
Well, all right, but Ann has too many foolish ideas.
Go on, go in the dining room, both of you.
Well, what's going on here?
Have I lost my little girl?
Well, Roger wanted to sit next to you for a while, and I thought it would be nice if the children took turns.
I never...
Never what, Roger?
Nothing.
Come, Ann. Come, dear. Come and help me.
Joe!
Oh, I brought it in by mistake.
Had it in my hand, I guess.
Nothing special in it.
Want to look at the headlines, Charles?
Thank you, Joe.
Roger, don't make so much noise with your soup.
If he holds his lips close together, he could draw it carefully, same as a horse.
Ann, don't be disgusting.
Mom, may I dip my bread in it?
Where's Charlie?
She wanted to serve the dinner tonight.
She'll be in in a minute.
You're right, Joe.
Nothing special.
Nothing special tonight.
Oh, here she is!
Here's my girl.
I wonder how many hours you slept.
If you could tell me the exact minute you went to sleep, and the exact minute that you woke up, then tell me if you woke up in between, and how long you stayed awake each time you woke up,
then I could tell you exactly...
You won't be able to sleep tonight, Charlie. Nobody who sleeps all day can sleep all night, too.
I slept all right, and I kept dreaming, perfect nightmares about you, Uncle Charlie.
Nightmares about me?
Uh-huh.
You were on a train, and I had a feeling you were running away from something.
And when I saw you on the train, I felt terribly happy.
Why, Charlie, how could you feel happy seeing Uncle Charles on a train?
Goodness knows I don't want to see him on a train.
I hope he stays here forever.
Well, he has to leave sometime.
I mean, we all realize he has to leave sometime. We have to face the facts.
I like people who face facts.
Ann... Well, we're not going to face any such facts as those.
Oh, Ann, would you like to see the funnies?
I'm too old for funnies.
I read two books a week.
I took a sacred oath I would.
Besides, in this family, no one's allowed to read at the table. It isn't polite.
Ann, don't correct your elders!
She's right, Emmy. I'm forgetting my manners.
Joe, I'm going to blame this paper on you.
Roger, go to the kitchen, look in the icebox, and bring me a big red bottle you'll find there.
You can throw the paper away. Dad's read it, you've read it.
We don't need to play any games with it tonight.
Ann, you can help Charlie carry in the vegetables.
I saw that bottle when I was getting dinner.
You know what St. Paul said, "Take a little wine for thy stomach's sake."
Wine for dinner. Sounds so gay!
Charles, remember the time they had the champagne when the oldest Jones girl got married?
This is Sparkling Burgundy.
Well, one sip and I'll be calling it "Sparkling Burgledy."
Maybe I'd better not take any.
Oh, imported.
Imported Frankie and his tweeds?
And his loaded cane.
His loaded everything!
Roger, go to the cupboard and get four of the small glasses with stems.
Charles, I promised Mrs. Greene, the President of our club, that you'd talk to the ladies, and she wants to know what you're going to talk about.
Well, what am I going to talk about?
Lecturers usually give them travel or current events, don't they?
Oh, Charles, not current events. We get current events.
What sort of an audience will it be?
Oh, women like myself. Busy with our homes, most of us.
Women keep busy in towns like this.
The cities, it's different.
The cities are full of women, middle-aged widows, husbands dead, husbands who've spent their lives making fortunes, working and working, and then they die and leave their money to their wives, their silly wives.
And what do the wives do, these useless women?
You see them in the hotels, the best hotels every day by the thousands, drinking the money, eating the money, losing the money at bridge, playing all day and all night, smelling of money.
Proud of their jewelry, but of nothing else.
Horrible, faded, fat, greedy women.
But they're alive! They're human beings!
Are they?
Are they, Charlie?
Are they human, or are they fat, wheezing animals, huh?
And what happens to animals when they get too fat and too old?
Well, I seem to be making my speech right here.
Well, for heaven's sake, don't talk about women like that in front of my club!
You'll be tarred and feathered. The idea.
And that nice Mrs. Potter's going to be there, too. She was asking me about you.
The Greenes are bringing her here to the little party I'm having for you after the lecture.
Joe, it's Herbert.
He always comes when we're eating.
Good evening, Mrs. Newton.
Good evening, Mr. Oakley.
Good evening.
Well, Herb, how's your mother?
Oh, she's just middling.
Had your dinner?
Oh, I had mine an hour ago.
You folks are getting pretty stylish, having dinner later every evening.
Joe.
Huh?
Joe, I picked some mushrooms before dinner.
You don't say.
Mushrooms mean anything to you, Joe?
Well, I eat them on my steak when I'm out and the meat's not good enough as it is.
Hey, if I brought you some mushrooms, would you eat them, Joe?
Suppose I would.
Then I've got it.
You see? The worst I'd be accused of would be manslaughter.
Doubt if I'd get that.
Accidental death, pure and simple.
A basket of good mushrooms, and two or three poisonous ones.
No, no.
Innocent party might get the poisonous ones.
I thought of something better when I was shaving.
A bathtub.
Pull the legs out from under you, hold you down.
It's been done, but it's still good.
Oh, what's the matter with you two?
Do you always have to talk about killing people?
We're not talking about killing people.
Herb's talking about killing me, and I'm talking about killing him.
It's your father's way of relaxing.
Can't he find some other way to relax?
Can't we have a little peace and quiet here without dragging in poisons all the time?
Charlie!
She doesn't make sense talking like that. I'm worried about her.
Roger, go get her. Bring her back.
I'll go. You stay here and finish your dinner.
I'll catch up with her.
What's wrong with her?
Excuse me, Mr. Norton.
Well, well, you're always running along the street at night.
Say, where were you going in such a hurry last night?
Just doing an errand.
Is this gentleman your uncle I've heard so much about, Charlie?
Yes, he is.
Uncle Charlie, this is Mr. Norton.
Glad to know you. What's the name?
Oakley. Charles Oakley. Nice to meet you.
You better keep your eye on your niece, Mr. Oakley.
I'll have to give her a ticket for speeding one of these nights.
City ordinance about running along these sidewalks.
Hear that, Charlie?
Don't want to break the law. - I'll take care of her, Mr. Norton. - All right.
Good night.
Good night.
What's the matter, Charlie?
What's wrong?
I want to talk to you.
You're hurting my arm again.
You're coming here with me.
I can't. I've never been in a place like this.
Go on in.
Why'd you bring me in here?
What does it matter where we are?
Hello, Charlie. Hello.
Hello, Louise.
Uncle Charlie, this is Louise Finch.
Hello.
Glad to meet you.
This is my uncle, Louise.
I was in Charlie's class in school.
I sure was surprised to see you come in.
I never thought I'd see you here.
I been here two weeks.
Lost my job over at Kern's.
I've been in half the restaurants in town.
What'll you have, Charlie?
Nothing, thank you.
Bring her some ginger ale. - I'll have a double brandy.
Well, Charlie.
Well?
Think you know something, don't you?
That young fellow told you something.
Jack?
Why should he know anything about you?
Now look, Charlie.
Something's come between us.
I don't want that to happen.
Why, we're old friends.
More than that.
We're like twins.
You said so yourself.
Don't touch me, Uncle Charlie.
What did he tell you? What did that boy tell you?
He's got nothing to do with it.
I hope he never knows anything about you.
Charlie, you're a pretty understanding sort of girl.
If you've heard some little things about me,
I guess you're a woman of the world enough to overlook them.
You're the head of your family, Charlie. Anyone can see that.
I'm not so old.
I've been chasing around the globe since I was 16.
I guess I've done some pretty foolish things, made some pretty foolish mistakes.
Nothing serious.
Just foolish.
Oh, Charlie, now, don't start imagining things.
How could you do such things?
You're my uncle. My mother's brother.
We thought you were the most wonderful man in the world.
The most wonderful and the best.
Charlie, what do you know?
I'm sorry I was so long. We're awful busy.
Whose is it?
Ain't it beautiful?
I'd just die for a ring like that.
Yes, sir, for a ring like that, I'd just about die.
I love jewelry, real jewelry.
Notice I didn't even have to ask if it was real.
You can tell.
I can.
Bring me another brandy.
Sit down.
You think you know something, don't you?
You think you're the clever little girl who knows something.
There's so much you don't know.
What do you know, really?
You're just an ordinary little girl living in an ordinary little town.
You wake up every morning of your life and you know perfectly well that there's nothing in the world to trouble you.
You go through your ordinary little day, and at night, you sleep your untroubled, ordinary little sleep filled with peaceful, stupid dreams.
And I brought you nightmares.
Or did I?
Or was it a silly, inexpert little lie?
You live in a dream.
You're a sleepwalker, blind.
How do you know what the world is like?
Do you know the world is a foul sty?
Do you know if you ripped the fronts off houses, you'd find swine?
The world's a hell. What does it matter what happens in it?
Wake up, Charlie. Use your wits. Learn something!
You going, Charlie?
Charlie, will you help me?
Help you?
The same blood flows through our veins, Charlie.
A week ago, I was at the end of my rope.
Oh, I'm so tired, Charlie.
There's an end to the running a man can do.
You'll never know what it's like to be so tired.
I was going to...
Well, then I got the idea of coming out here.
It's my last chance, Charlie.
Give it to me.
Graham and the other fellow, they don't know.
There's a man in the east. They suspect him, too. And if they get him, I'll...
Charlie, give me this last chance.
Take your chance.
Go!
I'll go, Charlie. Just give me a few days.
Think of your mother. It'll kill your mother.
Yes, it would kill my mother.
Take your few days.
See that you get away from here.
You realize what it'll mean if they get me?
The electric chair.
Charlie, you've got to help me. I count on you.
You said yourself we're no ordinary uncle and niece, no matter what I've done.
You go in. I'll be in in a minute.
East, west, home's best. - Where's Charlie?
She's outside.
Don't worry about her.
Well, what was the matter with her?
She said she was a little edgy. I persuaded her to go for a little walk. - She's calmed down now.
Oh, I'm so glad. I've saved a dessert for you, Charles.
Oh, thank you, Emmy. We had an ice cream soda downtown.
Oopsy-daisy! Now, off to bed you go!
Roger, come here! - No.
Come here!
There's my girl.
Ann. - Ann.
Hello!
You must be trying to hide or something.
We're not hiding.
Well, you said, "Psst." People who are hiding always say, "Psst."
We just don't want to yell on Sunday.
Look, Ann.
Ask your sister to run over here for a minute.
Don't noise it around. Just ask her quietly. We'll wait here.
Did my father and your father have a feud?
My father?
Because if they didn't, there's no sense in my asking Charlotte quietly.
Mama won't care.
She thinks girls ought to marry and settle down.
In a book I'm reading...
Just ask her, Ann. Don't be literary.
All right.
Remember, I'm doing all the talking.
Hello. - Hello.
Hello, Catherine.
Good morning, Mr. Graham.
Well, Catherine, this is Mr. Saunders.
How do you do?
How do you do?
Ann says you want to speak to me.
Saunders wants to speak to you.
Come on, Ann. Tell Catherine the story of Dracula.
Come on, Catherine.
What do you want?
Let them get a little bit ahead.
I want to tell you about that photograph we took. The one of your uncle?
You gave it back to him. He probably burned it.
Not that one, he hasn't.
We gave him the wrong film.
Yes, we got the picture all right. We wired it east.
They've got witnesses in the east who can identify the man we want from that picture.
What are you talking about?
What do you mean, identify him?
Just what I said.
The minute the witnesses see that picture, we'll know whether or not Oakley's the man.
We're waiting for the wire now.
And then Uncle Charlie will be...
That's right.
That's the way it is.
Graham thought perhaps you could get your uncle to leave town now, or within a couple of hours.
It could be better for... - I've got to, haven't I?
I've got to!
What's the most time you'll give me?
Say, two hours.
I'll make him leave! I'll make him.
You seem pretty sure he's the man we want.
Why? No reason why. I'm just scared.
You're the ones who seem sure.
It's just that I can't stand for anything to happen here.
You know what he's done, don't you?
No, I don't want to hear!
Well, I want you to get this.
We're really doing you a favor.
You've had a bad break, but if you know anything more about your uncle than you've already told us, let's have it!
We also want to know when he leaves town and how he leaves town.
If you hold out on us... - I won't.
I'll tell you.
Step on a crack, you'll break your mother's back.
I wish I knew we could trust you.
I won't do anything to help him, I promise.
But you can't ask me to spy on him and come running to you.
We've made a bargain. I'll get him to leave.
That's all I'll do. I'll get him to leave.
Think, Charlie, think. The man's dangerous. If he gets away from us, he'll...
I don't want to hear what he'll do.
We've made a bargain now.
I'll let you know when he leaves.
Funny if he turned out to be the wrong man.
Could be.
Ann.
I broke my mother's back three times.
Not bad.
Say, Ann, you didn't finish telling me whether Miss Rose married the rich guy, or the one she was in love with.
Well, how long have you two been so friendly?
Oh, we play a game. I ask questions, and she knows all the answers.
The only trouble is, I can't make out what she knows and what she's making up.
I never make up anything.
I get everything from my books.
They're all true.
Come on, Ann. We'd better get home and help with dinner.
Good-bye, Mr. Saunders. - Bye.
Good-bye.
Good-bye, Mr. Graham. Mr. Saunders.
Good-bye, Catherine.
Come on, Catherine.
Ann, why don't you pick some flowers for the dinner table?
Simple flowers are the best.
I didn't ask for orchids.
I wish I'd been born in the South.
Southern women have a lot of charm. They pick flowers with gloves on.
Good-bye, Catherine. - Good-bye, Charlie.
See you after dinner. All right.
Bye.
Hello, Ann.
Hello.
How was church, Charlie?
Did you count the house?
Turn anybody away?
No, room enough for everyone.
I'm glad to hear that.
Show's been running such a long time, I thought maybe attendance might be falling off.
Anything special on the noon broadcast?
A fellow said they caught that other fellow, the one they call the Merry Widow Murderer.
They did, did they?
Where?
State of Maine. Portland.
Didn't catch him exactly.
He was running away from the police, and they were just about to nab him at the airport, and he ran plunk right into the propeller of an airplane.
Oh, boy!
Cut him all to pieces.
Had to identify him by his clothes.
His shirts were all initialed, "C.O'H."
Well, makes a good ending. Couldn't have done better myself.
I guess that closes that case pretty final.
Sure does.
Never cared much for that case.
Well, I think I'll go up and get ready for dinner. I'm hungry.
I can eat a good dinner today.
Charlie, I have great news for you.
Where can we talk alone?
Well, we got a wire from Maine, so we can call off the job.
I'll bet you're relieved. Believe me, I am.
Oh, I am relieved.
Here you were trying to get your uncle out of town.
He must have thought you were crazy.
Jack, now that it's over, I don't want to talk about it anymore.
I'd like to pretend the whole dreadful thing never happened.
There's nothing to pretend about.
There's mother's gloves.
Mother and her gloves. She's always losing things.
All mothers lose things. Someday, she'll be losing you.
Mothers don't lose daughters, don't you remember? They gain sons.
That's right. But gain isn't always the word.
Now take me.
Who'd want a detective for a son-in-law?
My father would.
He would?
You mean to say that if you walked up to him and said,
Father, I'm going to marry a detective," he wouldn't disown you?
It wouldn't have to be me. There's Ann. No.
Ann wants to marry a librarian.
She told me.
So she'll always have plenty of books around to read.
What's the matter?
I was laughing.
It's been so long since I laughed.
I like it when you laugh.
I like it when you don't.
I guess I like you whatever you do.
I guess I like you.
I'm glad. I like you, too.
Funny how you happen to meet someone and like them and like them.
Charlie?
Yes?
I suppose it couldn't ever really happen someday that you'd tell your father...
You know, about marrying someone. A detective, I mean.
I don't know.
I didn't mean to tell you.
I wanted to wait until you'd forgotten all the mess we've been through together, till you could stop thinking of me as a part of something unpleasant and frightening.
I wanted to wait and come back, and then tell you.
But I can't help it. I want to tell you now.
I love you, Charlie. I love you terribly.
I know it's no time to tell you now, and I'm sorry.
Do you mind?
I don't mind.
Do you think you could think about it?
About your loving me?
And perhaps your loving me.
I'd like us to be friends.
We are friends.
I'd like to have that to think about.
Nothing more?
I don't know, Jack.
I just don't know yet.
All right.
But I may come back?
Oh, please come back.
Please come back.
Listen, Charlie.
When I go away, will you go back to that square in the middle of the town and take a good look at it?
'Cause that's where I first knew I loved you.
That's where we had the fight.
I didn't know what to do.
I like my job, but I didn't like it that night.
I hated it that night.
You hate it now?
No, not now.
You know, this is a swell place.
I'm going to put a bronze plaque right up there.
That door's always banging shut!
Oh, it's...
What are you two locking yourselves in the garage for?
When I was young, we sat in the parlor.
Hello, Mr. Oakley.
I was saying good-bye to Charlie. - In the garage?
In the garage, and the door got stuck.
Well, now I'll have to say good-bye to you.
Well, let's say good-bye right out here on the lawn.
No use taking a chance on the garage, again.
Finished here?
All finished, but I'll be back.
You'll be seeing me around.
Oh?
Not on business, though.
I can understand you coming back.
Charlie's a fine girl.
She's the thing I love most in the world.
I mean it.
Have a nice trip, Mr. Graham.
And don't take any more photographs without permission.
Rights of man. You know, freedom?
We'll have a talk about freedom some day, Mr. Oakley.
Bye.
Good-bye.
Don't forget to write. Remember, you have all the addresses.
Jack!
Anything else?
I've got butter, fruit, green thread, and go to the library.
And whatever vegetable looks freshest.
If I've forgotten anything, I'll send Ann later.
All right.
Mother!
Charlie! Darling!
Are you hurt?
I tripped.
Oh, what is it?
Is it your ankle?
I don't think I'm hurt. I grabbed the banister.
Oh, darling. You might have been killed!
I worry myself sick every time one of you children come down these stairs.
They're too steep and rickety. They ought to be fixed.
Are you sure you're all right?
When are you leaving, Uncle Charlie?
Oh, come now, Charlie.
That other business, it's all over. I'd like to forget it.
We're all happy here.
When are you leaving?
I'm not going, you see.
Not yet. I'm not going.
I want to settle down.
Live in a place where people know me, have some money in the bank.
Some sort of business.
Be a part of this family.
I see.
And the most sensible thing for you to do is to be friends with me.
I can do a lot for you, Charlie.
A lot for all of you.
No, not you.
We don't want anything from you.
I wish I'd told my mother about you. I wish I had.
I know what you've been thinking.
How do you think your mother would have felt?
What would it do to her now?
How about your father?
His job at the bank?
What would become of all of you if everything came out?
I know. You needn't be afraid. I can't tell them.
But I'm not afraid, Charlie.
What would you tell?
Who'd believe you?
A waltz runs through your head.
You don't like the initials on a ring, and you connect it all up with a newspaper clipping.
And now, you haven't even got the ring. I don't know what became of it.
You have it.
I?
I gave it to you.
I don't want you here, Uncle Charlie.
I don't want you to touch my mother.
So go away, I'm warning you.
Go away, or I'll kill you myself.
See? That's the way I feel about you.
Here you are, Joe.
Oh, perfume.
Just the nice, fresh, clean smell of lavender.
Yeah, I know.
You look very handsome, both of you.
I must say, I'm pretty proud of the two men in my family.
Emmy, you're a dream.
It's a shame the children have to sit on our laps.
Yeah, it's going to be a tight squeeze for everybody. It won't do my pants any good.
Oh, Joe, I wish you could drive the car.
Well, we do it this way.
Charles, you'll sit...
Mother, Uncle Charlie can sit in back with Dad, and the children can fit in perfectly well beside them.
Nonsense. I'm getting a cab.
You all go in the taxi, and Charlie and I'll go in the car.
No, Uncle Charlie, you go in the taxi.
I want to ride in the taxi!
Course you do. So it's all arranged.
Charlie, you run out to the garage and get the car.
I'd much rather drive the family.
Charlie, I want you to hear my speech on the way.
After all, you're my severest critic, you know.
Well, anyway, we need a taxi.
Ann, go and call Mr. Abercrombie.
Mother!
Mother, please ride with me. Father can take the children.
You know, I'll bet I'll be the only man there outside of Charles fool enough to dress up like this.
Then you'll be the only other one to be correct.
You look very distinguished.
Charles, are you all ready?
Joe, are you? - No.
Wait a minute!
I've got to get my overcoat.
Oh, Joe. Well, please, dear. Hurry!
Take your time, Emmy. They can't start till I get there.
It's getting chilly in here.
KSRO, Santa Rosa, with studios in Vallejo and Santa Rosa, California.
May as well have a little music while we wait.
Oregon State Police pressed their search today for five... Oh!
Does it have to be so loud?
Gets the lower tones better.
I like it loud!
If music's too soft, I can't tell what they're playing.
If I have a band, I'll at least have 87 men.
Help, everybody! Somebody's caught in the garage.
They're suffocating! There's something the matter with the door.
Joe!
I'll take her.
I've got her.
Joe, there's a bottle of whiskey on my bureau.
Charlie. Charlie. Dear Charlie.
Charlie?
Emmy, rub her feet.
Roger, run and get something to fan her with.
Charlie!
Ann, don't, dear.
Charlie?
What are you trying to say, Charlie?
Go away.
Go away.
Emmy, she wants you.
I'm here, darling. Here's mother.
That's right, my baby.
That's right, my brave little girl.
Here... - Take a little sip of this.
No, I'm all right.
Joe, call Dr. Phillips.
No, please, Dad. I'm all right. I just want to get up.
You had a wonderful escape, Charlie.
Someone must have left the motor running.
I couldn't find the key to turn it off.
The key was there when I went in.
Lucky thing I passed by.
She might have died. You saved her. You kept your head.
You knew just what to do.
Don't know how I happened to come across that way.
We'll put the lecture off. There isn't going to be any lecture.
Oh, yes, there is. I want you all to go.
There's the cab now. Go on, all of you.
Oh, I couldn't. I just couldn't go.
Who found me in the garage?
Herb heard you beating on the door.
I was coming across the backyard, and I heard this gasping and beating on the door, and I figured there must be a human being in there.
Quick thinking, Herb.
Lucky thing.
I'm glad you happened to be going by, Herb.
Come on, Mother.
I want to stay with you.
Well, I don't feel much like making a speech now, when I think what might have happened to you, Charlie.
I'm all right.
I just want to sit on the porch awhile and get the air.
No, darling, I won't hear of it.
Mother, I'm all right, really.
I could go to the lecture, but I'd rather stay home and get things ready for the party.
Darling, I want to stay with you.
Herb, will you take Roger?
Ann, you come with us.
I just don't understand it.
First the stairs and...
Mr. Graham isn't there?
This is the Hotel Stewart in Fresno, isn't it?
And you don't expect him?
I see. Thank you.
He isn't there?
Thank you very much. Good-bye.
Can you tell me where I can reach him?
I've already tried to get him at the address he gave me in Fresno.
Thank you.
Mom, may we have some sandwiches?
Oh, but don't take anything from the dining room. Go in the kitchen. Please go in.
And just leave your coats out...
Joe, dear, will you take care of everyone?
Charlie!
I'll be right down.
Well, now...
Now, now, Mr. Oakley.
I thought champagne was only for battleships.
None for me, thanks, and none, I'm sure, for my wife.
But we hope you'll all forget we're here.
I'd like to propose a toast to...
Isn't Charlie coming down?
She'll be down in a moment.
Mrs. Potter.
Don't take that one. I don't know why I make tomato.
They always soak through the bread when they've been standing.
Try one of these.
It's just whole wheat bread and cream cheese.
It's the paprika makes it pink.
Mr. Greene.
Mrs. Greene, what would you like?
Thank you.
I think I'd like to propose a toast, too.
Emmy.
To our distinguished visitor, the man who's made the best speech heard in this town for years.
To that very good fellow, Mr. Oakley. Thank you, sir.
Herbie.
Thank you.
We don't get many American speakers, Mr. Oakley.
Seems like foreigners make the best talkers.
Here she is. Now for my toast.
Charlie, you're just in time for a farewell toast.
I hate to break the news to you like this, but tomorrow I must leave Santa Rosa.
Not forever. - Not forever.
If that isn't the strangest coincidence.
Why, I was planning to go to San Francisco myself tomorrow morning.
Charles.
Oh, Emmy darling, I didn't mean to spoil your fun tonight.
I got a letter today.
I have to catch the early morning train.
I'll miss you, Emmy.
But I want you all to know that I'll always think of this lovely town as a place of hospitality and kindness,
and homes... Homes.
But I can't bear it if you go, Charles.
Oh, Emmy, I'll be back.
I've arranged with Dr. Phillips for our little memorial for the children.
It isn't any of the things you've done.
It's just the idea that we were together again.
I'm sorry!
But, you see, we were so close growing up.
And then Charles went away, and I got married, and...
Then you know how it is.
You sort of forget you're you.
You're your husband's wife...
We'll be looking for you, Mr. Oakley. We feel you're one of us, don't we, Margaret?
Indeed, we do.
And I want to thank you on behalf of our club members.
And bless you for your gift to our hospital.
The children will bless you, too, in all the years to come.
Thank you, sir.
Excuse me, sir, but I can hear the train coming now.
Excuse me.
Better get aboard, Charles.
All right. Good-bye, everybody.
Roger, Ann, come see the train.
Come on, Charlie.
You can see they get off.
All right.
I want to see the rooms, the private ones.
I've seen berths.
I've slept in two uppers and one lower with Papa.
Good-bye, Joe.
Good-bye, Charles.
Good-bye, Emmy. Good-bye.
And don't forget to write, love.
I will. You write, too.
I'll send you my address.
Good-bye.
Don't jump on the seats, Roger.
Roger, what did I tell you?
Porter, there's one more bag. I think it got taken to the other car.
Will you get it, please?
Yes, sir.
Charlie, the train's going to start.
I don't want to get carried away.
Oh, boy! Maybe it's too late! Maybe I'll have to go along!
There's plenty of time. You run along, we'll follow.
Charlie.
Just a minute.
I want you to know I think you were right to make me leave.
It's best for your mother. Best for all of us.
You saw what happened to her last night.
She's not very strong, you know. I don't think she could stand the shock.
I remember once, when she was a little girl...
The train's moving, Uncle Charlie!
Listen, Charlie.
I want you to forget all about me.
Forget that I ever came to Santa Rosa.
Your hands!
Let me go, Uncle Charlie!
Let me go!
I've got to do this, Charlie, so long as you know what you do about me.
Not yet, Charlie. Let it get a little faster.
Just a little faster.
Faster.
Now!
Santa Rosa has gained and lost a son, a son that she can be proud of.
Brave, generous, kindly.
With all of the splendid dignity...
I'm glad you were able to come, Jack.
I couldn't have faced it without someone who knew.
I did know more. I couldn't tell you.
I know.
He thought the world was a horrible place.
He couldn't have been very happy ever.
No.
He didn't trust people.
He seemed to hate them.
He hated the whole world.
You know, he said that people like us had no idea what the world was really like.
Well, it's not quite as bad as that, but sometimes it needs a lot of watching.
It seems to go crazy every now and then.
Like your Uncle Charlie.
... the beauty of their souls, the sweetness of their characters live on with us forever.
When that April with his showers sweet the drought of March hath pierced to the root, and bathed every vein in such licour from which virtue engendered is the flower.
When Zephirus eke with his sweet breath inspired hath in every holt and heeth the tender crops and the young son hath in the Ram his half course run.
And small the flowers make a melody that sleep in all the night with open eye.
So pricketh them nature, in their courage, then long on folk to go on pilgrimages and the palmers, for to seek and stranger strands to distant shrines known in sundry lands.
And especially from every shire's end of England to Canterbury they went, the holy blissful martyr for to seek, that them had helped when they were weak.
600 years have passed. What would they see, then,
Chaucer and his goodly company, today?
The hills and valleys are the same. Gone are the forests since the enclosures came.
Hedge rows have sprung, the land is under plow, and orchards bloom with blossoms on the bough.
Sussex and Kent are like a garden fair, but sheep still graze upon the ridges there.
The pilgrims' way still winds above the wheel, through wood and break and many a fertile field.
But though so little has changed since Chaucer's day, another kind of pilgrim walks the way.
Alas, when on our pilgrimage we wend, we modern pilgrims see no journey's end.
Gone are the ring of hooves, the creak of wheel. Down in the valley runs our road of steel.
No genial host that sinking of the sun welcomes us in.
Our journey's just begun.
Getting on!
Canterbury, next stop.
Getting on, getting on!
Canterbury, next stop.
Next stop, Canterbury.
Canterbury, hey, that's my station!
Sorry, folks.
Thanks, Pop, I'll sit the next dance out.
Oh, you'll break someone's neck one of these days.
Yours too, I shouldn't wonder.
Don't you know there's a bylaw against getting out of a moving train, penalty 40 shilling?
Why don't you light up the names of your stations? How do you expect folks to read the signs?
I don't, nor don't the company.
I'm here to call out the name of the station.
Why wait till the train gets going?
Now, look here, in the first place, I called out the name of the station, loud, precise, and clear while the train was stationary.
You had ample time to alight, ample.
I heard you with my own ears calling out Canterbury after the train started to move.
He called out, Canterbury next stop. See?
But I'm going to Canterbury, darn it!
The train's going to Canterbury.
And you're stopping here at Chillingbourne.
Well, son of a gun.
What time is the nextâ¦ 8:57.
8:57?
AM.
Here, what do those stripes mean?
Sergeant.
Well, they're the wrong way up.
He's a sergeant, see?
Cut the quiz questions, Pop. What kind of a place is this with no train all night?
This is the kind of place where people sleep at night. Are you all right, Sergeant?
Yeah, I have a Chillingbourne cap.
Okay, ticket please. Give me a moment.
You can keep yon.
Miss?
Yeah?
These two gentlemen will accompany you to town hall.
Why do you think I need an escort?
No young lady must go alone at night, Mr. Colpeper's orders.
This way, please.
Who is Mr. Colpeper?
Local magistrate, justice of the peace.
Say Pop, is there a hotel in this place?
They'll tell you down at town hall.
Town hall?
Hey?
I said, don't tell me this whistle stop is a town.
Chillingbourne was constituted a municipal banner in the year 1085,
407 years before Columbus discovered America.
I didn't mean to hurt your civic pride, Pop.
Granted, sonny boy, and my name's Thomas Duckett, station master, acting.
Mine's Bob Johnson, sergeant, also acting.
Peter Gibbs, sergeant, underpaid.
Nice to know you both. Now, where's this hotel? I'll give your town hall a miss.
Oh, you can't do that, all visitors arriving must report to town hall, Mr. Culpeper's orders. That guy again?
How do I get to the camp?
Last bus, you'll just catch it if you hurry.
Where? Marketplace, by town hall.
How do we get there?
Chadding Street, and follow your nose.
Where's Chadding Street? - Through that gate.
Right, let's go.
Here, wait a minute, have you all got torches? - Not me.
I have.
I'll show you a real flashlight.
Put that light out!
What's wrong with it?
Everything.
Does the job, doesn't it?
But it'll do your job if the police catch you flashing it on.
You won't catch no 8:57.
AM.
Okay, okay.
Shall we go, if you're going to catch your bus?
Yes, that's right.
See you in the morning, Pop.
Oh, you'll be clever if you do. I don't come on till 12.
PM?
AM.
And keep an eye on the young lady, check?
Why do railroad companies always have gates like this?
I'll go ahead and shine my torch for you two.
Don't blind us.
What are you doing? Hey, what's going on?
What's that?
What's what?
Oh, my goodness, it's my hair!
Hair?
Something came out of nowhere and poured something on it.
Hi, where are you?
What's wrong with your hair?
It's some sticky stuff.
Sticky stuff?
Why, her hair's full of it.
So this is England, never a dull moment.
Listen!
Somebody up the street.
Quick, Bob, search light!
There he goes!
Hey, soldier!
Can you run, miss?
Watch me!
Hey, Bob!
There he goes, around that building.
Come on!
This way, we'll head him off.
Come on, Bob, you take the river.
Okay!
What's that?
Oh, it's me, darn it.
Any luck?
Not a sausage, now you wait here.
What, alone, no fear.
Think we missed him?
Well, we couldn't have.
It's a cinch he didn't double back.
He's inside, nowhere else he could be.
Let's find the door.
Here it is.
Is that a bus?
Sounds like it.
What's going on out here?
Is this the town hall?
It is.
Then that's my bus, you can handle this, Bob?
Sure.
Good hunting, let me know what happens, good evening.
Where's my bag?
In the road, there.
Peter Gibbs is my nameâ¦
A man is in this building, a soldier. He must have gone into one of the windows.
Just a minute, miss. And who might you be?
My name's Alison Smith.
She's going to work here.
Yes, I'm going to work on Mr. Culpeper'sâ¦
May I see your identity card please?
Identity card nothing, what kind of a cop are you?
American.
Somebody's poured some sticky stuff on my hair!
Sergeant, the Glue Man's out again.
While you're looking us up in the Domesday Book, he's making a getaway.
And what about my hair?
Just a minute if you please, one thing at a time. Are you the incident, miss?
Yes, look, my hair's full of it.
Oh, it's the Glue Man, all right.
Glue Man?
Have a look, dearie. Oh, we'll soon see to that all right.
What is this, an old Chillingbourne custom?
He's in the town hall, Sergeant.
Who is?
Your Glue Man, we chased him down the street and he's in this building.
Hold, there!
What's up, Ernie?
Oh, it's him, the Glue Man!
Where?
I heard the whistle. Up on the church tower. I ran all the way.
On route, I dropped, bumped into a soldier running across the square.
He caught the charter bus.
Nuts, that was Peter Gibbs.
And who may he be?
The soldier who was with us when it happened. Why don't you search the building?
You leave that to us, miss.
We may be slow in Chillingbourne, compared with London ways, and we ain't no G-men either, but we know our duty and we have our methods.
Ernie Brooks, you get back to your fire watching.
If you hear anything, blow your whistle, as a raze.
All right, Bertie.
Sergeant Bassett when on duty, if you please.
Constable Ovenden, you will accompany me on a tour of the building.
You will kindly stay here with the young lady, uh, sergeant is it?
Yeah, Sergeant Johnson.
Say, can't I come too? This guy may be dangerous. Have you got a gun?
This is Chillingbourne, Sergeant Johnson, not Chicago.
See, what kind of a crack is that? I come from Oregon.
I'm getting tired of this old Glue Man spoiling our games.
You shouldn't beat him, saves you money, the way you play.
There's a light in the courtroom.
There's someone in there?
Ready?
Yes, come on. Let's take him by surprise.
Anything wrong, Bassett?
Sorry, Mr. Colpeper, we didn't know you was still up here.
I see, all right.
Can you make me a cup of tea? I'm sure you've got a kettle on downstairs.
Here's my cup.
Yes, sir.
Sir, the Glue Man is out again.
How do you know?
An American soldier and a girl chased him here, sir.
What girl, what American?
Well, the girl who was the incident, sir. Isn't that right?
Yes, Sergeant.
She's come to work for you, sir, on your farm.
She's a land girl. There must be some mistake.
You say they chased the Glue Man here?
Yes, sir, they insist he's somewhere inside this building.
What are you standing talking for, Bassett?
Get on and search it.
Yes, sir.
Gee, what a job.
Is it coming out?
Beg pardon, ma'am?
Any better?
Well, I've got considerable on me, so there must be less on you, but there's still plenty on you.
Here you are, miss.
What on earth am I to do?
Soap's no good, hot water's the only thing.
Miss Grainger's just boiling a kettle.
You seem to be an expert.
She's the eleventh incident.
What about this glue-throwing character?
Captain, you don't mean to say you let him get away from you?
He got away, if ever he were inside.
Now we shan't be long, dearie.
Nice work.
Put another kettle on, Miss Grainger, and make some tea.
Mr. Colpeper's fire-watching. Oy, here's his cup.
Who's Mr. Colpeper?
Magistrate, wants to see you.
Oh, he does?
Okay, ma'am, let's give it another whirl with the hot water.
I guess Mr. Colpeper can wait a while.
Here, we know how to handle this.
Still a bit sticky, sir, glad to meet you.
Welcome to Chillingbourne, you're the first American soldier we've seen.
Bad luck missing your train, Sergeant, uhâ¦
Johnson, sir.
Say, what's that?
That's the old ducking stool, very sensibly used for silencing talkative women.
Are you there, Mr. Colpeper?
Excuse me.
That you, Brooks?
You're showing your light, sir.
Very careless of me. We take our blackout seriously in east Kent.
It's your first time in England?
Yes, sir.
Do you like it?
Sure, but I haven't seen much else but Salisbury.
You've seen something if you've seen Salisbury. It's a fine town.
Yeah, it's got some swell movies.
Really?
You're a great movie goer, Sergeant Johnson.
You bet. It's a great thing to sit back in an armchair and watch the world go by in front of you.
With your bad case, Sergeant Johnson, the people may get used to looking at the world from a sitting position.
I don't quite get you.
Then when they really do pass through it, they don't see anything.
Will you be going to a movie in Canterbury?
Is there anything good on?
This voucher will get you a room in the Hand of Glory, that's the inn.
One of the men will take you over, there's nothing to pay.
Thanks, that's swell of you, but I can pay.
No, no, you're our guest tonight.
Okay, thanks a lot.
That's all right.
Pity.
Pity?
Pity when you get home and people ask you what you've seen in England, you'll say,
I saw a movie in Salisbury and I made a pilgrimage to Canterbury and saw another one.
You've got me all wrong.
I know that in Canterbury, I have to look out for a cathedral.
Do look out for it, just behind the movie theater, you can't miss it.
Take the sergeant down to Mrs. Foster.
Yes, Mr. Colpeper.
And ask the young lady to come in. Good luck, Sergeant.
Goodnight, sir.
Colpeper.
Colpeper.
Up here, miss.
Thank you.
I'm sorry about the incident, Miss, uh?
Alison Smith.
Miss Smith.
I've been by the war agricultural committee.
Don't they telephone before they send people?
You wrote, they sent me.
I want a farm laborer.
You'll have to take what you can get, these days.
You've got me. I can do the work.
I'm sorry, Miss Smith.
You refuse to employ me because I'm a girl?
Miss Smith, there's a camp near this village full of soldiers.
I know!
Oh, you know?
I'm not interested in soldiers.
Perhaps they're interested in you.
Let them, they mean nothing to me.
Aren't you afraid to stay here?
Why should I be afraid?
After what's happened here.
Did you hear it?
What?
Somebody moved, there.
Nonsense.
It isn't nonsense.
Somebody's there.
How could there be, I've been here the whole time.
Why don't you want to open it, then?
Here's some more.
Uh, Mrs. Foster won't be long now, miss.
Can I help you?
Well, I've seen some topsy-turvy things in this war, and the last.
Good to see guests doing real work for me. No, miss.
Do you know Mr. Thomas Colpeper?
Do I know Mr. Colpeper?
You a Londoner, miss?
Well, what you say if I was to ask you, do you know who's the lord mayor of London?
But I don't.
You don't? No!
Well, aren't you ashamed? Not a bit.
I see.
That stone interest you, miss?
It comes from the old road, what some folks call the Pilgrims Road.
Yes, from the bend, up there on the hill.
What do you know about our bend?
I've seen it.
When?
Three years ago.
Oh, then it wasn't our bend you saw. It weren't uncovered then.
No, but the bend was there all the same.
Is it excavated now?
Yes, the whole bend.
Who gave the money?
Council.
I'm glad they changed their minds.
They didn't, we changed our magistrate.
For Mr. Colpeper?
For Mr. Colpeper.
How do you know about our bend?
I spent the whole of my holiday here, once.
I don't call you to mind.
We camped outside the village, in a caravan.
There ain't been no caravaneers by our bend for the past eight years.
That's all you know.
You ain't a gee, uh, geologist?
No. He was my fiancÃ©.
Girl, you can come up now, your room's ready.
Coming.
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
Starting tomorrow, I shall have the Elizabeth room free.
She slept there.
Who?
Queen Elizabeth.
There's an American in it now but he's going in the morning.
Is his name Johnson?
You're the girl?
Yes, we washed it but it's still full of glue.
Revolting.
Extraordinary thing to do, isn't it?
Silly, I call it.
You'll have to wash your hair again, several times.
I'll send you up a kettle.
Thank you.
This is your room.
Who is it?
It's me, Alison. Is that you, Bob?
Gee, ma'am, I didn't know you were stopping here too.
Well, I didn't know myself. I didn't get that job.
Sorry about the job.
Never mind about that, whatâ¦
Let's see, now, since you didn't get the job, that means you're going in with me on the 8:57?
That's just what I wanted to talk to you about. Bob, would you mind very much not catching the 8:57?
Would I mind?
I've got to meet a buddy in London and I want to get the Canterbury first, I promised Ma.
Well, we can go in on the evening train together, and I've written to Peter Gibbs.
Well, what's he got to do with it?
Dear Sergeant Gibbs, you will have heard by now that the Glue Man got away, but he didn't get far.
You mean they've got him?
No.
What kind of a quiz is this?
You met Mr. Colpeper, didn't you?
Yes, he got me this room, and a swell room it is.
There's something about him I don't like.
And he's got a Home Guard's uniform. Don't laugh, Bob.
What I want to do is to snoop around in the village.
Peter can do that at the camp. And I want you to help me, Bob.
You need about as much help as a flying fortress.
8:00, Bob.
AM or PM?
Tea, sir.
I take coffee for breakfast.
You can have coffee for breakfast, sir.
It's an early morning tea.
Can't I have early morning coffee? Oh, no, sir.
What's that?
What, sir?
That window, there.
That's the other side of the street.
That street seems kind of narrow.
They have a story, overhangs.
They do say two six-foot men could shake hands across the street, sir.
Why would they want to do that?
That is what they say, sir.
â" Oh, come, come, come â" To the church in the wild wood â" Come, come, come â" To the church in the vale â"
Morning!
Blimey mirror.
Hello, there.
Hello.
What are you doing?
Standing.
What's your name?
Leslie, what's yours? Bob.
Are you a soldier?
Sure, can't you see my uniform?
I've never seen a uniform like that. What do those stripes mean?
I seem to have heard this one.
I tell you they mean sergeant, and you tell me what?
They're the wrong way up.
Correct.
Could you use a quarter?
A quarter what?
A quarter of a dollar.
That's a shilling.
Catch.
Thank you very much.
You're welcome.
Are you an American soldier?
I have that honor. Mother!
Yes, what?
This is an American soldier.
Don't point, dear, it's rude.
Up, then, come on.
See ya later.
Okay.
Good morning.
Good morning, ma'am.
Sleep well?
Yes, thanks.
Sure is mighty lonesome, lying in the middle of that bed.
One of the three largest in all England.
They say that two six-foot men couldn't shake hands across that bed.
Why would they want to do that, ma'am?
Depends on who's in it, young man.
You missed the Canterbury train.
Thought I might take a ride in with Miss Alison this evening.
You'd better think again because she's stopping.
I woke up this morning, saying to Miss Susanna Foster, you're mad to let a great strong girl like that go when you need someone yourself on the farm.
Was I right?
I guess you ain't often wrong, ma'am.
She's a nice girl.
She having breakfast?
No, she's at a wheelwrights.
Up north, was you?
Yes.
North Umberland?
Yes.
Cheap farming, mostly.
Yes. Ah, they don't know nothing about farming up there.
You're finding society down here.
Yes.
Do you know how to cut the tire off? Know what the tire is?
Yes.
Then you have to sole it down. Know what soling down means?
No.
Ah, well, soling down means, uh, soling down, see?
You goes up the end of the spokes. Then you have a look at them felly joints.
You know what felly joints is?
No.
Ah, you want to know that. You have to open them felly joints three-eighths of an inch.
You'd better remember that just in case Susanna Foster asks you what was wrong with the wheel.
Thank you.
Mr. Horton, what was your job before the war?
Mine?
I've been a blacksmith for 37 years.
My father was a blacksmith, and his before him.
I was selling things in a department store before the war.
I wonder how you would look behind a counter, Mr. Horton.
Horton behind a counter?
American at that, Bob Johnson's the name.
Sergeant, ain't you?
This is Sergeant Bob Johnson of the American Army.
Morning, folks.
Morning.
Morning.
Nice place you've got here.
So you didn't catch the 8:57.
No, ma'am. You look as though you belong around here already.
Do I?
Sure do.
I thought I'd stick around today myself.
Thought I might have a chat with Mr. Colpeper.
I hear he knows a lot about the Old Pilgrims Road.
Ah, so you're interested in that old road, are you?
Well, the wheel's finished, what are you standing around for?
Put her on the cart.
Yes, sir, I'm crazy about that old road and those old Canterbury pilgrims.
AH, them was the days for a wheelwright. Mind that strap, boy.
You got a linchpin, Ned?
Yeah.
Did you hear the news last night, Mr. Horton?
Weren't nothing on the wire, miss.
No, I didn't mean that sort of news. I mean, what happened here last night.
We get all our local news at six o'clock, miss.
You've got a local newspaper?
No, that's when the pub opens.
What happened?
Your Glue Man was on the warpath last night.
Who was he after this time?
Me.
Oh, you.
I suppose that'll learn you not to run around at night.
On the contrary, I shall go out every night until I catch him.
Aren't likely.
Come on, then, get it down.
Can I give you a hand there, ma'am?
Thanks, Bob, I'd rather do it alone.
Elm.
Yeah, and chestnut.
Do you get much sweating in your own planks?
Oh, average.
At home, we build two at a time, for steadiness, side-by-side.
Well, so do us, to tie them longer strips together.
Saw them last winter.
Is that how you do it in America?
It's how we do it in my part of America.
But we take off the strips when we put the planks away in stock.
Well, so do us! How long do you allow for seasoning timber?
A year for every inch of thickness.
Same here. You can't hurry an elm.
No, but some folks try to, all the same.
Yeah, can't do it.
Can't stand to see their money lie idle a piece.
And the war.
Why the war?
Folks gone mad. They cut oak at midsummer.
No!
I'm telling you, yes.
Oak should be cut in winter.
Of course!
Or the spring.
That's right.
And beech in the fall.
And plank it outâ¦
At Christmas.
That's how my dad taught me.
Ah, you was well brought up. In the timber business, was you?
Lumber.
My granddad had the first mill in our parts.
Dad, he was a cabinet maker. I cut my teeth on wood shavings.
Dad, he made my cradle out of cedar of Lebanon.
He said what was good enough for Solomon was good enough for a Johnson of Johnson County.
Gee, I can smell that cedar now.
Can I bum a ride off you, ma'am?
Jump in.
Looks like a good way to see the sights.
Just a minute, missy, we have our dinner at midday.
I'd like to have you join us, Sergeant, that is, if you ain't got nothing better to do.
Thanks a lot, I'd be glad to.
Ah, that'll be fine.
Giddyup.
Hey, mother!
Yes, Jim?
One extra for dinner.
I was thinking of Cornish barn hen.
Ah, well, think of a big chicken.
Nice piece of weather boarding, that water mill.
I must ask the old gentleman who built it. I'll bet it was a Horton.
How did you manage to get around Mr. Horton in that way?
I believe you are a detective.
We speak the same language.
I'm English and I don't speak their language.
He knows about wood, see, and so do I.
That's it.
That is it.
Oh, look at that house.
What a perfect place.
I wonder whose it is, and what it's like at the back.
What wouldn't I give to grow old in a place like that?
Tom, breakfast!
Beats me. Last night, I could have believed anything.
But this morning, if ever a man looked, looked right, heâ¦
Yeah, it don't add up.
But, you know, Alison, things don't add up in life.
Look, Bob, are you positively off tonight?
Positively, but I'll see you before I go and tell you what I find out from old Jim Horton.
What I plan to do the rest of the afternoon, I don't know.
It's a movie. It's Saturday, they have a matinÃ©e.
What, go to a single feature, not me.
Write some post cards.
I'll have to do that to the folks from Canterbury.
Write to your girl.
I don't write my girl anymore.
How do you expect her to write to you if you don't write to her?
You've got that in reverse English.
She doesn't write to me anymore, so I don't write to her.
That's the way it is?
That's the way it is.
Perhaps she has written.
I haven't had a letter in seven weeks.
Sometimes the mail's lost by enemy action. A ship might have gone down.
Yes, a ship might have gone down, the address might have been wrong, there are a hell of a lot of Johnsons in the Army, maybe she was ill, maybe her mother was ill,
I've had all the maybes.
I cabled her, I haven't heard a thing.
She was a swell girl, Alison.
We used to talk. She liked the woods.
She learned some of the bird calls I taught her real well for a girl.
She caught her first rainbow with my rifle, two-and-a-half pounds.
She broiled it herself.
We'd been walking in the woods often, following the trail, and haven't said a word for two hours.
And then both said the same thing together.
What do you figure it means when that happens?
It means love.
It means no letter in seven weeks.
I don't believe this enemy action stuff.
All the other fellows get letters from their girls.
If a ship goes down, it can't just be that particular part of the ship where my letters are dumped that goes down, can it?
Well, so long, Alison.
I hope you don't mind my calling you by your first name.
I shall miss being called ma'am.
Time marches on. Which way does your road go, ma'am?
He knows.
I hope up that hill. Why that hill?
That's where the Pilgrims Road runs.
Along that hill?
Yes.
From the bend, at the eastern edge of the hill, pilgrims saw Canterbury for the first time.
You've seen it?
Yes.
With a friend of mine.
Boy or girl?
Boy.
I hope he writes to you.
No, he doesn't.
Mable the mail was lost by enemy action.
No, Bob.
As it happens, he was lost by enemy action. He was a pilot.
Shot down?
Yes.
Sorry.
I hope you'll have better luck!
I'm Prudence Honeywood. My sister telephoned you were coming.
Glad to see you, we're shorthanded here.
Smiler brought you along all right, I hope.
Yes, Miss Honeywood.
Not afraid of work, are you?
No.
Tie sheaves? - Yes.
Cart muck?
Yes.
Peel potatoes?
Yes.
Knit a harrow?
Not very straight.
Neither can I.
Can you spot wheat?
Yes.
Spread lyme? - If I have to.
You'll have to.
Know anything about hops?
Not a thing.
Most of the hands are down in the fields today. You'd better stay here this morning.
We can put you back in that shed.
Someone told me you had a frightening experience last night.
Wasn't frightening, just unpleasant, and annoying.
I thought so.
It's happened to other girls, none of them died.
My sister likes to dramatize things. You know the type.
Do I know them?
Well, do you or don't you?
I worked in a London store before the war.
Selling things?
Yes, garden furniture, picnic baskets, all that sort of thing.
Did you like the job?
Not much.
It was better than selling ordinary furniture.
I used to imagine my deck chairs in beautiful gardens, and my picnic baskets opened in the woods and fields.
So you like gardens and the country?
Hope you won't miss your London store here.
I shan't.
We get up at sunrise.
But you don't have to queue for the bus.
It's hot and sweaty this time of the year.
You should see the stores in August.
The flies are the very devil.
So were the customers.
That's your room over there, the open one.
You won't get much of a view, I'm afraid.
You should have seen the view from my room in London.
Was it a long street with every house a different sort of sadness in it?
It was a long row of back gardens, where the tall, sad houses were all the same.
Ghastly in winter.
Airless in summer.
You seem to know them.
The only man who ever asked me to marry him wanted me to live in a house like that.
Miss Honeywoodâ¦
Call me Pru, you might as well.
I don't like Prudence, name or quality.
Prudence soon, what has been, and she liked Susanna.
You spoke of other girls who had the same experience as I did last night.
Do you know any of them?
Yes, I have one working in the hop yards, Fee Baker.
I'd like to talk to her.
Well, you'll see her when you take their dinner down.
Don't worry.
What's for dinner?
Got you each an apple dumpling.
Good.
You're Fee Baker, aren't you?
And you're Alison Smith.
Yes.
You're working for Pru?
Yes.
Where are you from?
London.
Oh, I've got an uncle in London.
He's a policeman, his father was a policeman, too.
Very good dancer, the uncle, not the father.
Are you fond of dancing?
Am I?
There aren't many boys around here who can tell their own feet from their partner's,
Lots of soldiers, no good dancers among them?
I wouldn't go out with a soldier for 100 pounds.
Why?
The Glue Man's a soldier, everybody knows that.
He wears a soldier's uniform.
And what makes a civilian a soldier, a uniform.
Besides, there weren't any old Glue Man here before the soldiers came.
Suppose he isn't a soldier.
What are you driving at?
Suppose he's a civilian, someone in the village.
In uniform?
Suppose he wore a uniform to make the girls afraid to go out with soldiers.
Huh, that might be any one of a dozen. Might be a Glue Woman.
What?
Don't be soft. Take Ernie's family.
Who's Ernie, another uncle?
No, my Ernie is with the Eighth Army.
You think his family likes me going out with strange soldiers?
But a girl must live.
I'm sure I'm right.
Well, suppose you are, where does it get you?
Why worry, you weren't the first.
Do you know the other girls?
Of course, there's Dorothy Bird, she's the post girl,
Susan Cummings, Polly Finnâ¦ Hold on a tick.
If nobody else cares, I'm going to find out what can be done about this Glue Man business.
I can tell you that.
Hot water, plenty of hot water.
What's the idea of frightening my horse?
I suppose you weren't scared?
Why don't you keep your beastly carriers off the Pilgrims Road?
I know that voice.
Hey Alison, this is Peter Gibbs.
I thought you didn't get that job. Who'd you steal this cart from?
I'm working for Mrs. Foster. And if you don't take your carriers out of the road at once,
I'll tell her what happened and she'll report you to your CO.
CO's idea.
We didn't know who was in the cart and didn't even know it was a girl.
You're just an objective.
I don't believe a word, and I'm in a hurry.
And we're not. You're our prisoner, but we'll exchange you for some information.
What have you been up to, have you got a plan?
What's Bob doing to earn his keep?
Archie, this is Miss Alison Smith, I told you about.
Archie here had an Angus.
A Gwladys.
Come on, now, do tell the tale.
Well, that's all there was to it, love's young dream.
Glue.
What next?
Well, there wasn't any next, she went home like a scolded cat.
And that was after dark?
Conditions were perfect, until the Glue Man came.
What was the girl's name?
Gwladys, she spelled it with a W. Gwladys what?
How should I know, it wasn't a lasting friendship.
Anyway, it's happened to her.
When, what date?
Oh, no, Archie's my witness, I'll get all the dope.
Okay, Archie.
And talking of dopeâ¦
What's that?
Colpeper Institute, Chillingbourne, admission free, each Saturday at 7:30 PM, a lecture illustrated by lecture slides will be given by Thomas Colpeper,
JP. The members of H.M. forces only.
After the lecture, an open discussion will be held, smoking permitted, attend the whole series and bring your friends.
Admission free, it's tacked up all over the camp, that's the fourth in the series.
Well?
Well, how about it, useful?
It says members of H.M. forces only.
Well, aren't you in the Army, women's land army? Isn't that H.M. forces too?
Yes, it is, but the lecture's tonight.
Well, what's wrong with tonight?
I've got a job, I'm working here.
You are, good. - It's my first day.
Well, what's wrong with it?
We'll go together.
Yes, I suppose I can, if I finish in time.
Can you finish in time?
Yes, if it's important.
Important, in detective work, every clue's important.
What clue?
Did I say clue?
You did.
I meant view, don't be late.
Not heaven itself upon the past has power, but what has been has been and I have had my hour.
Are you from the States?
Yes.
I've got a brother there.
That so?
Butt City.
Butt City, Montana.
Oh, yes, of course.
Name of Isaac Wells, maybe you know him.
Tall fellow?
Short and fat.
Can't place him.
Pity.
Good evening, good evening.
Coming to the lecture?
Yes, in a minute, sir.
I come Three Sisters Falls, Oregon.
I come from the Seven Sister's Road London, put it there.
Pleased to meet you. You sure a whole mess of sisters ahead of me.
Good evening, good evening.
I'm glad to see such a big house.
The last time I was to speak, July 11, I think, to an audience of one, he was reading his evening paper.
I waited for a bit then I asked him, shall I start?
He said, start what?
I said, didn't you come to hear the lecture?
He said, no, the pub's closed.
Well, we'll waited till 5:30 then we adjourned the lecture and both went to the pub.
Would some of you mind the blackout, please?
And I hope there are going to be plenty of questions. Will somebody start the ball rolling now?
Yes, sir. May I ask why you want to lecture us at all, sir?
Well, you see, it's a form of human weakness.
It's only human nature when you hear something interesting, you want to pass it on to somebody else.
Well, I know a lot of interesting things about this part of the country, and I feel the urge to pass some of them on to you.
Good evening, you can find a place at the back, I think.
Oh, good evening, Sergeant Johnson, would you like to join your two friends?
Yes, sir.
Good evening, Miss Smith.
Good evening, Mr. Colpeper.
Say, won't you come back and join us?
Well, I wouldn't like to presume.
Sure, come on, we'd like it.
True?
Sure.
Friend of mine.
Greeting, all.
Good evening.
Big nose.
What?
Tell you later.
What about your train?
Brother, you can take myâ¦
I was born here, my father was born here.
You're here because there's a war on.
You'd rather be in your own part of the country.
You're telling us.
That's why none of you like being here very much.
But suppose there was peace again.
And holidays again.
Well, you'd like to spend your holidays in a beautiful and interesting part of the country.
And if you ask any man who knew England well, where shall I go to, 10-to-one he'd say, go to Kent, but you're in Kent.
Don't rub it in, sir.
Yes, where's the wife and kids?
Only passing through, I know.
I don't know what you are in civil life.
You might be cook, clerk, doctor, lawyer, merchant.
Let me remind you that as much as 600 years ago, doctors and lawyers and clerks and merchants were passing through here on the old road with we call the Pilgrims Way.
And cooks.
Yes, and cooks, too.
Blimey, cooks tour.
These ancient pilgrims came to Canterbury to ask for a blessing or to do penance.
You, I hope, are on your way to secure blessings for the future.
I was thinking, sir.
Yes?
What have we got to do with this old road, and the people who traveled on it 600 years ago?
Hear, hear.
Isn't the house you were born in the most interesting house in the world to you?
Don't you want to know how your father lived and his father?
That's all right, but how do we know it really happened?
There are more ways than one of getting close to your ancestors.
Follow the old road, and as you walk, think of them and of the old England.
They climbed Canterbury Hill, just as you.
They sweated and paused for breath, just as you did today.
And when you see the bluebells in the spring and the wild time, the broom in the header, you're only seeing what their eyes saw.
You follow the same rivers, same birds are singing.
When you lie flat on your back and rest and watch the clouds sailing, as I often do, you're so close to those other people that you can hear the thrumming of the hooves and their horses,
and the sound of their wheels on the road, and their laughter and talk, and the music of the instruments they carried.
And when I turn the bend of the road, where they, too, saw the towers of Canterbury,
I feel I've only to turn my head to see them on the road behind me.
Macky?
How about you?
Makes a nice change.
Now I'd like to show you some drawings and photographs of things we've found in recent excavations.
Hey, Bob, movies.
I don't like free shows. Something always goes wrong.
First I'll show you the bend on the Pilgrims Road.
See?
Sorry, I always do that.
Oh, thanks.
Perhaps our friend will be able to fix it.
He only looks after the carriers.
Pity, I shall only be able to show half of the slides.
By the way, if any of you are really interested, drop in at my house at any time and have a chat.
Thank you.
Are you interested, Miss Smith?
Why shouldn't she be?
I'm interested, too.
Otherwise, we wouldn't be here, right?
Right.
What interests you especially?
Well, what you were saying. Of course, we know we don't know anything about that sort of thing.
Oh, yes we do.
Do we?
We know all about the old road.
We know that the pilgrims weren't the first to use it.
Quite right. I'm sorry it was used by the Romans.
Here in Kent, it certainly goes back to the Iron Age.
I thought this was the Iron Age.
Pipe down, it's very interesting.
A geologist found some Belgian coins not far from here some time ago.
Last time I was in London, I inquired at the British Museum about them but I'm afraid they have no record.
I have them.
You have them?
Yes, they were left to me by the man who found them.
I'd be very grateful if one day you'd let me see the coins.
Anytime, after my luggage gets here.
I wouldn't keep them very long.
I'm going to give them to this museum.
Not to you.
Thank you.
Very much obliged.
May I ask for the blackout again, please?
Here we go, the bend on the Pilgrims Road.
Put that light out!
Okay, okay, why pick on me?
Gee, I forgot! - What?
The proof. - I've got it!
Tell us about it.
Not here. Topography plays an important part in my expose.
Hi, buddy. Have a cigar?
Is this Cherring Street?
That's right.
Leading into Market Place?
That's right.
That building there is the town hall?
That's right.
Now, Mr. Colpeper's office is the second story window?
That's right.
Thanks. Are you, by any chance, the village idiot?
Hey!
Why, that's right.
Anyway, he is right. I checked it this afternoon.
So where does he get it?
You'll see. Now, we came down this street.
That's right.
We didn't see a light in the town hall. That's right.
You're killing me.
When we were in the town hall, the police found Mr. Colpeper in his office.
Later, I saw him there, and so did you.
That's right.
When I was with him in his office, the janitor, or somebody, tapped on the window and said we were showing a light outside.
I saw him pull the curtain myself.
That's very interesting.
We hadn't seen a light, so it followsâ¦
That he wasn't in his office.
He was in such a hurry to draw the curtain when he got back that he never noticed thatâ¦
That's right.
Oh, it's the first real clue we've had, Alison.
Yes.
I still can't believe that he's the Glue Man.
What motive could he possiblyâ¦
Is there a bus?
Sounds like it.
Well, come on, we must run.
See you tomorrow after church, Alison.
Peter is like the camel is in reverse, always going and never coming.
Cigarette?
Thank you.
That was clever of you, to work that out.
Yes, wasn't it?
Make a swell letter home.
Bob Johnson solves village mystery.
I forgot, I don't write to home anymore.
We shall need the watchman's evidence.
You didn't even hear what I said.
I'm sorry, Alison, but I just can't forget that girl.
A fellow goes to war and into all kinds of dangers andâ¦
What do you find so dangerous just now?
I don't mean just now.
But I mean, you go and fight in a foreign country andâ¦
I bought her some writing paper. I write her every time we stop.
And not one line from that blonde. I guess Ma was right.
She says blondes are no good.
What color is your hair, Alison?
Blonde.
No kidding!
Come on, I'll take you home. And tomorrow, I'm going to organize the local guerrillas.
Hello, there. Can I speak to you for a minute?
You speak, you'd better not shout it.
You bet, what's cooking?
A battle, a blind operation, back paddle.
I get it. Say, Colonelâ¦
General, General Halls.
This is Commander Tom, in charge of our landing crew.
Mind if I come aboard?
Not at all, at your own risk, of course.
Sure.
Bring it aside.
Here I come.
Can we have a talk now?
Okay, onto the bank.
Would you mind taking a paddle?
Sure.
Fire at will, fire!
Face it, General, you are outnumbered.
All right.
Hello, General, nice work.
Good forewarning us.
Sure, why didn't you pick sides?
Because my men must have berries, and I've only got six handkerchiefs.
Well, that's different.
Now the battle's over, would your two armies lease lend you two generals for a while?
What's lease lend?
Never ask that question again, son.
If the isolationists were to hear you back home, they'd be mighty sore.
Who are the isolationists?
Shortsighted folks.
Why don't they buy spectacles?
From what I hear, that's just what they are doing. Now here's two quarters.
He means two shillings.
One for each army.
The smaller army will get a bigger share, but that's right too.
Catch.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Is there some place around here we can have a pow-wow?
On the hill.
Looks like this isn't the first time this place has seen a battle.
No.
Now see here.
You've heard about the Glue Man, haven't you?
Don't be scared.
I'm not scared.
Nor am I.
Good, because I'm on his trail.
The Glue Man?
Yes.
You want to catch him?
That's the idea.
Now, if this was the States, every kid in the village would lend a hand to get him.
Who?
I'll tell you.
I want you to help me check some things, are you game?
Yes.
First, I want to know how many drug stores there are in Chillingbourne.
What stores?
Drug stores, where you buy soap and razor blades and ice cream.
You mean the grocers.
Call it what you like. Now, if you wanted to stick something together and needed the stuff to stick it with, where would you buy it?
At the grocers.
Is there only one?
Only one.
Next, I want to find out who's been buying sticky stuff at grocers.
Is he a friendly sort of guy?
Mr. Holmes.
If that's his name, is he human?
He's his father!
Holy smoke, is it that time already?
I've got a date for church.
Show me the shortest way from here and on the way, we'll map out a plan of campaign.
Excuse me, can you tell me anythingâ¦
At the office, they'll tell you.
Oh, no, it isn't bus information I want. It's about, about the Glue Man.
What about him?
Who are you?
You are Polly Finn, aren't you?
Yes, what if I am?
Miss Winter?
Clarice Winter?
Yes?
Have you got a minute?
Five, if you want them.
Can I come up?
No, stay where you are, I'll come down.
You can't come in the box, you know, it's against regulations.
Well, what is it?
I only want to ask you one or two questions.
Oh, well, fire away.
Good morning.
Good morning.
Are you Dorothy Bird?
That's me.
I got your name from Fee Baker. I'm the new land girl working at Fosters.
Go on.
August 27th. There.
Fee Baker, Susan Cummings, Dorothy Bird, Polly Finn,
Gwladys Swinton, and me.
Each time the thing happened after half past 11, but never later than midnight.
Did it ever happen after midnight to anybody?
As far as I can check, no.
I've checked that, they all say it never happened after midnight.
That's important.
Why?
Facts are always important. What about dates?
Fee Baker, June the 8th, Susan Cummings, June the 24th,
Gwladys Swinton, oh, not sure, and me, August the 27th.
Of course, Bertha Rogers on the 11th of August.
Well, wait a minute.
No, false alarm. Well, I can fill in some dates.
Gwladys Swinton was July 10th.
Two other girls, anonymous, July 2nd and August 3rd. Well, let's see.
That gives us two on Tuesday, one on Wednesday, one on Thursday, two on Friday, one on Saturday, blank on Sunday and Monday.
Well, what do you make of that?
I don't know.
Well, anyway, our dates are still incomplete. There were 11 cases in all.
So what?
You know, I'm beginning to think the whole village is cracked.
Just look at that boy.
90 degrees in the shade and he's wearing a winter overcoat.
Hello, Leslie, Terry, come on up.
That's for me.
They'll never get past old Elba.
I'll fix that.
Kids and almanacs, this won't get us anywhere.
You got a better idea?
Yes. I'm going to call on Mr. Colpeper this afternoon, and I want you to come with me.
You can't crash in without being asked.
He has asked me, last night. Anyone really interested, he said.
Well, I'm interested.
Yes, that's clever.
Well, will you come?
I'm not very keen, take Bob.
No, he's got a date.
Meet General Terry,
General Leslie, also Commander Todd. He's the delicate one.
You all like lemonade?
Yes.
You too, Commander?
Yes.
You can take this coat off now, Commander. You're through the enemy's lines.
Meet the account book of Mr. Holmes, the general's father and Chillingbourne drug store keeper.
You mean the grocer.
Beg pardon.
A, B, C, oh. Colpeper, Thomas.
Flour, soap, sugar, baconâ¦
A week's rations.
Here, you look at it, you know the names.
Any sticky stuff?
Do some of the richer people here, like the rector, Mr. Colpeper, buy everything in Chillingbourne?
No, we get lots of things from outside.
How do you know?
We collect salvage from the houses.
Salvage!
Good afternoon, you want my son?
Yes, as a matter of fact, I was at his lecture last night.
And you want to talk to him about it, of course.
Come in.
Thanks.
He'll be here in a moment.
Thanks.
Good afternoon, Sergeant.
Oh, how do you do, sir?
Sorry to bother you on a Sunday.
Oh, don't mention it. I expect your weekdays are fully occupied.
Yes, they are.
Do sit down, what do you drink?
Do you have whiskey on Sunday?
Nothing for me.
Won't you have something?
A cider, please.
Hey, mom, cider!
Well, how's the Army going?
You seem to be busy from morning till night.
It's a bit like your job.
Mine?
You put a great deal in to get very little out.
Are you a farmer in civil life?
Me? No.
May I ask what part of the country you come from?
London. Not much material there for your lectures.
More there than anywhere.
What about the British Museum?
Yeah, I suppose it is pretty good.
Yes, pretty good.
It's only a day's walk from Chillingbourne.
What, 50 miles, some walk.
Not if you like walking, do you like walking?
Not if I can help it, why walk if there's a train?
Oh, mother.
Go on with your talking, I can manage.
I see, sir, you're interested in mountaineering.
Yes, I do a bit of it.
I suppose you'd recommend we wait at the bottom until somebody builds a nuclear railway.
I say why climb to the top at all?
What's wrong with the valley?
The answer's in yourself.
You're dead right.
And the trouble with this country is that every second man thinks he's born to be a missionary, and every third man has a bee in his bonnet.
Thank you.
Look at you. You don't mind?
No, of course not.
You're a gentleman farmer with a fine house.
I'm sure you've got a first-class farm and run it well.
Yet the first chance you get, you're off climbing mountains, or digging up stuff which 600 years ago was thrown out as junk.
No bee in your bonnet? No.
I've got my job, 30 pounds a week. I've got my flat.
I meet my friends when I want to meet them.
That's good enough for me. Don't you want a bigger flat, better job, 40 pounds a week?
I've got the best job a man in my business can have.
May I ask, what is your job?
I'm an organist.
In Saint Paul's Cathedral?
No, in a cinema, West End.
I'm a cinema organist, a good one.
I'm sure you are.
Have you always wanted to be a cinema organist?
Not when I was a kid.
I wanted to be a church organist. I studied for nine years, then luckily for me,
I met a chap who told me about a job.
A new theater, brand new organ.
You see, I never really had the chance to play on any big organ, except the one at the academy.
You never played a church organ?
Not a big one.
Seems to me, Sergeant, there are two kinds of men:
one learns to play Bach and Handel only to play I Kiss Your Little Hand Madame, and the man who learns to walk step by step so that one day he might climb Mount Everest.
Perhaps another convert in the study of ancient Kent.
I feel I have gone rather off the rails.
Never mind, there's plenty of time. Not much to do in Chillingbourne, how do you find it?
I haven't seen much of it.
Oh, how's that?
I only arrived on Friday night.
Yes, I remember seeing you at my lecture with Miss Smith and our American ally, Sergeant Johnson.
Did you walk in together from the station?
Yes. I was with them when the attack took place.
This fellow must be a tough sort of customer, about your height.
As a matter of fact, I had some excitement myself that night, and we searched the town hall, I was on fire guard.
Do you have to do fire watching?
Oh, yes.
As well as home guard?
Twice a week home guard and fire watching every eighth day.
Tom?
Yes, mother?
The salvage boys are here again.
They were here last week.
Well, they say it's a paper drive. Maybe it's my homemade toffee.
There are six boys and Ovenden's donkey.
I'll go and talk to them, excuse me.
Hello, salvage again? Yes, sir, waste paper.
We've got a lot of sacks left.
Did you go around the vale last time? No, sir.
You'd better go around by the back way.
Emma will show you.
How's your father's bag, Telly?
Awful, sir.
Ah, too bad.
I ought to be going now, sir.
Nonsense, I'm enjoying our talk, let's have another mug.
Hello, coming, ma'am.
Four and five and six and seven, two shillings and seven pence.
Now what, press button A, okay.
Looks like I hit the jackpot.
What's that, ma'am?
Press button B?
Check.
Reinsert coins and press button A.
Check again.
A buttons, B buttons, mirrors, tea drinker, left-hand driving, stripes upside down.
Yes, ma'am, it sure is difficult, and hot.
Here I come, button A.
Made it.
Sergeant Michael Roczinski, please.
R-O-C-Z-I, yeah, that's correct, US Army.
He said what?
Now see here, ma'am, I don't care what Mickey Roczinski told you.
He's a buddy of mine. We come from the same company. Wake him up, it's four o'clock.
He can't sleep out his whole leave in London.
You can't.
You won't?
Say, you give good service in your hotel.
Well, tell him Bob Johnson rang.
Bob, B-O-B, Bob.
Call it what you like.
Tell him I can't get to London. He's to meet me in Canterbury.
I'm not in Canterbury now, but I'll be in Canterbury tomorrow.
Where will he meet me?
Holy cats, I don't know where, I've never even seen the place.
Where can he meet me in Canterbury?
Cathedral.
That's right, tell him to meet me in Canterbury cathedral at 11 o'clock.
Thanks.
These London dames have plenty on the ball.
Now look, forget sex for a little while, will you?
I've either solved the whole thing or wasted a perfectly good Sunday.
What about me and my whole furlough?
See that?
Without difficulty.
Now where's that list you made today of the dates of the crimes?
Right here, butâ¦
And now I'll tell you when the crimes were committed.
Why tell me, I have them here.
Yes, but I have them. Now, check.
The last one was Friday, August the 27th.
Considering we were both thereâ¦
Before that, Thursday the 19th.
Unproven.
Oh, take it from me, it's right.
Shandy? - No thanks.
Before that, Wednesday the 11th.
Tuesday, 3rd of August. Hey, that's right.
July the 26th, a Monday.
July the 18th, a Sunday.
10th of July, a Saturday. 2nd of July, a Friday.
All correct.
24th of June, a Thursday.
Then one on Wednesday, the 16th of June, and Tuesday, the 8th of June, altogether, 11.
Say, what have you got there?
This, my fine feathered friend, is the fire guard roto from Mr. Colpeper's house, and the dates that I've quoted to you are the nights that he was on duty.
Every eighth day.
Gee!
Then Ernie Brooks clenches it.
What has he said?
Same as me.
He saw the light in Mr. Colpeper's office around midnight, but not before.
Ho, who goes there?
Sentry, make him come up.
Hello!
How you doing, General?
Okay, full up to now.
Here is something.
Name of a firm, Reimends Limited. Who are they?
A London firm, lot of branches.
They sell office accessories, paper, ink, and gum.
Well, that's that. The rest is just routine.
Yes, we've got him cold.
Let's see now, it was a new football we agreed on, wasn't it?
You sure that's enough?
You've earned it.
Thank you very much.
The pleasure, General, is entirely mine.
Hey, catch!
Glorious, isn't it?
Is anybody there?
It's a real voice you heard, you're not dreaming.
No. Just now, I, I heard sounds.
What sounds did you hear?
Horses' hooves, voices, and a lute, or an instrument like a lute.
Did you hear anything?
Those sounds come from inside, not outside, and only when you're concentrating and you believe strongly in something.
Just now, I was concentrating on who was coming up the hill to disturb me.
Disturb you, at what?
Being there, smelling the earth, and watching the clouds.
Why don't you sit down?
You know, I was very mistaken about you. I'm sorry.
I was mistaken about you, too.
You have to dig to find out about people as well as roads.
Do you know why I wanted to stay so much?
I wanted to be here again.
You've been here before?
Do you see that clump of trees?
I spent 13 perfect days there in a caravan.
Your caravan?
It belongs to me now.
You're the owner?
Is there such a thing as a soul? He must be here somewhere.
He loved this hill so much.
I love it, too.
May I ask, were you engaged?
Three years.
Long time.
His father was the trouble.
Did you ever meet each other?
Well, yes, we didn't dislike each other.
They were a very good family.
He thought his son should marry someone better than a shop girl.
Good family. Shop girl.
Rather dilapidated phrases for war time.
Not for Geoffrey's father. It would have taken an earthquake.
We're having one.
Too late for me.
There are a lot of funny things in the world.
What, for instance?
For instance, why should people who love the country have to live in big cities?
Something's wrong.
Miracles still happen, you know?
Do you believe in miracles?
When I was your age, I didn't believe in anything.
Now I believe in miracles.
For shop girls?
For everybody.
You know, I think a shop girl has a bigger chance of a miracle than a millionaire.
I can see you've never been a shop girl.
Nor a millionaire.
See those clouds forming?
They'll one day tomorrow.
Tomorrow, I've got to go into Canterbury, to the agricultural committee.
I shall visit my property.
You have property in Canterbury?
My caravan.
It's jacked up there in a garage. I pay half a crown a week for it.
Quite a lot for a jacked up caravan.
Not for my caravan.
Can you bring it here?
I hope so.
Pilgrims to Canterbury often receive blessings.
Do you think even a visit to the agricultural committee could be the instrument of a blessing?
Who knows?
If not, I might have a word with you.
Yes, sir, I was born with an open mind.
And mouth.
And mouth, as you remark.
But it sure is a surprise to me to find how much I like everything over here.
Must they see us?
I may ask but one thing.
Not if you keep low.
What's that? - Why do you, from sunrise to sunset, and at odd hours throughout the night, have to drink tea?
I shouldn't be too noisy about it if I were you.
But I hate the stuff.
Well, after Pearl Harbor, you Americans joined the honorable company of tea drinkers.
Don't forget that the Nazis and Japs have knocked down every country they tried to except the tea drinkers:
China, Russia, and England.
So long live drinking tea.
Drinking tea doesn't appear to be much good for the wind.
If anybody had made me walk three miles before the war, and then climb a hill, I'd say he could bury me at the top.
I thought organists as a race were climbers.
Church towers.
I use a lift.
Boy, cast your eye around that noble prospect.
Wasn't it worth the climb?
Maybe.
Of course, I freely admit it's nothing to compare with the view from Three Sisters Mountain.
Now don't start to tell me that you've got higher hills and broader rivers.
I don't see any river.
There, that's the river Star.
That?
It goes to Canterbury.
Going to Canterbury is no proof it's a river.
I'm going to Canterbury and I ain't no river.
Well, I'll bet it's no Mississippi.
And I'll admit I've never seen the Mississippi.
You'll be happy to tell your folks you've seen the river Star. And English blackberries.
I am happy. Ours are bigger than these.
I feel fine.
The whole time, ever since we sailed, something's been wrong with me.
Maybe it was my girl. Maybe I was homesick.
And now, for the first time, I feel swell.
Maybe it was because my mind was preoccupied.
In the Army, they think mostly about keeping your body occupied.
They've not much time to worry about your mind.
Yeah.
The air here is as good as Hyde Park.
Hyde Park, that's in London?
Very much in London.
What would you be doing this afternoon in London, if there wasn't any war?
Sunday afternoon?
Reading, playing cards with the boys, waiting for the pubs to open.
Occupying the mind, letting the body take care of itself.
You don't fancy the countryside much, do you?
If it's truth, I hardly realized there was a countryside before the war.
Funny, that, how the war can open your eyes to a lot of things.
That sounds like the Glue Man's lecture.
Take me, for instance, I was no G-man before the war.
Imagine me, Bob Johnson of Johnson County, Oregon, coming over here and solving the Glue Man mystery.
While you're throwing bookcases at yourself, don't forget me and Alison.
The nutty thing about it is, I like him.
Who?
Old Colpeper.
He's a bit cracked, but I like him too.
Come on, Pete, I'll race you down.
You're on!
Getting on!
Getting on!
Canterbury stop!
Next stop, Canterbury!
Yes, well, he knows. He didn't deny it, did he?
He didn't say a word.
No, he wouldn't, are you going to tell the police?
Certainly, he's called the tune, now he's got to pay the piper.
Hey, what's the holdup, George?
Mr. Colpeper's a bit late.
Did you get that?
Well, how do you know he's going to Canterbury?
It's Monday, his day on the bench.
On the bench?
Hello, pop.
Hello, sonny boy. Bench of magistrate.
The district law court.
Good morning, Mr. Duckett.
Morning, miss.
I warned you to keep an eye on her Friday night.
Well, here he comes.
Get on, Mr. Colpeper.
Thanks.
Thank goodness he didn't come in here.
Good morning.
You don't mind my sitting with you, it's only 10 minutes to Canterbury.
There's plenty of room.
I'm glad to meet you all together.
Well, I suppose you're on your way to rejoin your unit, Sergeant Johnson.
Yes, sir.
And you're off to the agricultural committee.
And you're going to sit on the bench.
And you, Sergeant Gibbs?
I'm going to the police station.
I see.
An excellent police force, the Kent constabulary. They solve every crime, sooner or later.
Do you think the Glue Man knew that?
He knew it, all right.
But he didn't think that what he did was a crime.
What else can you call it?
Upsetting the whole village, giving the soldiers a bad name with everyone.
Some children hate going to school. Their parents have to force them to go. Is that a crime?
Pouring glue on girls' hair is.
It's awful to get out.
You're not going to defend pouring glue on people?
Certainly not.
I'm going to defend pouring knowledge into people's heads, by force, if necessary.
What knowledge?
Knowledge of our country, the love of its beauty.
Beauty of the countryside, who cares about these things in war time?
Who cares about them in peace time?
I tried it before this war. Why should it be any better after it?
I've written articles that didn't get further than the county papers.
I rented a hall in London to speak from but nobody came to listen.
I even held a meeting in Hyde Park.
That's no subject for Hyde Park.
I found that out.
Then the war came, and just as I was thinking, like you, that all the things that I'd been preaching about would have to wait until peace time, a miracle happened.
That's the trouble, you believe in miracles.
Yes, I do.
The miracle was the Army decided to build a camp just outside our village.
Young men flowed in from every part of the country.
I felt as a missionary must feel, one day he finds there's no need to travel into the jungle to find converts, because the savages are coming to him.
Thanks for the compliment.
There's no sin in being a savage.
But a missionary who doesn't try to do his duty is a bad missionary.
Well?
Well, here was a chance to learn from me.
I planned a series of lectures, no one came.
I tried again and again, nobody turned up.
I went to see their CO, he sympathized.
He said when the men had finished their work, they had dates with the girls in the village, or they went to the movies to see glamour girls on the screen, or they go to dances.
They were always with girls or after girls.
Well, what's wrong with that?
Yeah, it's natural to feel lonesome in a strange place.
You have a girl at home, haven't you?
Would you like her to go out with strangers when you're 3,000 miles away?
5,000 miles.
Most of our girls have their men in the services.
The older people didn't like the idea of them going out with every soldier that came along.
I suppose they couldn't do anything about it.
It was difficult.
Nobody wanted to stop the soldiers having a good time.
So you stopped the girls from having one?
Exactly.
Did I ever tell you about old Dad Butler who killed the fly on his baby's head with a sledgehammer?
Mr. Colpeper, didn't it ever occur to you to ask the girls to your lectures?
No.
Pity.
Well, the fly is dead, the baby is alive and kicking, no harm's been done.
Oh, hasn't it?
What beats me is that a man in your position, a magistrate, somebody whose job it is to judge other people,
I wonder what sort of sentence you would pass if the Glue Man was brought before you and your friends on the bench?
It would depend upon the findings of the court.
I would try to find the truth.
I never pass sentence without doing that.
I should try to discover the motives of the accused.
I should question every witness.
But you know that every witness would be against him.
Are you against him?
Fee Baker said that a lot of people in the village were not against him.
Are you against him?
He meant well.
Would you believe a burglar who said he meant well?
If it was his first offense.
He could prove that he broke into the house in order to save the baby from burning to death.
What baby?
Old Dad Butler's baby.
In any case, Sergeant Gibbs, if harm has been done, I shall have to pay for it.
And in order to make you pay, somebody must denounce you.
I want to make that quite clear.
There are higher courts than the local bench of magistrates.
Pilgrims for Canterbury, all out and get your blessings.
Rough sort of pilgrimage for you.
Pilgrimage can be either to receive a blessing or to do penance.
I don't need either.
Perhaps you are an instrument.
Do I get a flaming sword?
Nothing would surprise me.
Taking a pilgrim's view, Sergeant Johnson?
Yes, sir.
Well, if you ever have a son who comes to Englandâ¦
Here's hoping he comes in peacetime, not like his father.
And his grandfather.
And his grandfather?
Make him promise he'll come a pilgrim, too.
At the moment, sir, I'm having a little trouble with my future son's mother, but your advice is sound.
I overheard you say last night that you like me in spite of yourself.
That's true enough.
Well, I like you too. And up here it's tough, but you'll try to make out.
Do you know the way?
Yes, thanks.
I'm taking Bob to the cathedral. He's got a date there with his buddy.
Then it's goodbye.
Good luck.
Thank you.
Why good luck to you especially?
Yes, why you?
Military secret. - What's cooking?
Tell a fellow.
We're off today.
No, where to?
Don't worry, I'll be seeing you.
It's a date.
And the more of us, the merrier.
I'm looking for the police station.
Thank you.
Sergeant?
Yes, sir?
Watch out for convoys.
Very good, sir. Christ's Church in 10 minutes, carry on.
Very good, sir.
Inspector.
Yes?
Superintendent Hall wants to see me.
He's not in.
When will he be?
Well, it's hard to say.
He's got a job on, special service in the cathedral, and they're marching through the city.
I think I'm one of them.
Well, you ought to know, suit yourself, but he won't be back until the soldiers are gone.
Trouble is, when the soldiers are gone, I'll be gone too.
Well, you might find him around the cathedral. Come on, Sergeant.
Good morning, Doctor Colte.
Early as usual.
Excuse me, sir. Have you seen Superintendent Hall anywhere?
This is Canterbury Cathedral, not the police station.
I'm sorry, sir, I was told he might be here.
He wants to see me urgently.
Urgently?
Excuse me, sir. I think you dropped this.
Hm, too much urgency.
Do you mind my looking at the organ for a moment, sir?
Go ahead.
Are you the organist, sir?
Do I look like the chapel-man?
This is some organ.
What do you know about it?
I'm an organist, or at least I was before the war.
Oh, well, once an organist, always an organist.
Unless, of course, you only play the mouth organ.
Where did you study?
Royal Academy of Music.
Under who?
Poirot. Did you know him, sir?
Oh, cut each other for 27 years, but he's a fine teacher, none better.
Yes, we thought so. Are you playing this morning, sir?
Later, there's a special service for a battalion of soldiers.
That's my battalion.
You going, too? Yes, sir.
When did you play last?
Are you deaf?
I played in the cinema. Cinema, oh.
When I was a young man your age, after I got my degree, I played in a circus.
The harmonium.
Piano wasn't loud enough, especially with the elephants.
How much do they pay you in the cinema?
30 a week.
Oh, they only paid me 22.
Ah, but 22 shillings then was more than 30 today.
Perhaps 22 shillings then could buy as much as 30 pounds today.
Well, oh, no, no, no, I don't think so.
Well, do you want to play?
I'd like to.
Not afraid of it?
No, I don't think I'm afraid.
You can have a go, then.
If you're one of them, it's only right that you should play for them.
Now, show what you can do.
Play something, anything. Only don't swing it.
And my dad's pa built the first Baptist church in Johnson County.
Oregon red cedar, cedar shingles.
1887.
Well, that was a good job, too.
Excuse me, would you mind telling me, is this Old Canterbury Lane?
No, this is Rose Lane. Canterbury Lane is further up.
I haven't been here since 1940. The Rose Hotel used to be here.
Just where we're standing.
This is the parade, and that is Saint George's Street.
Oh, yes, I see, thank you.
It is an awful mess, I don't blame you for not knowing where you are. You get a very good view of the cathedral, now.
Excuse me.
Is this Rose Lane Garage?
Yeah.
You don't want to take her out, miss, do you?
No, I, I just want a look at her.
She's a good friend of mine.
Caravan? Yes.
Rude.
We ain't touched this since the blitz.
What happened to the tires?
Requisitioned. You know the regulations.
Mr. Portal couldn't let you know because he had no address for you.
He's got the receipt, he'll be glad you're here,
What a shame.
I knew I should find you here.
I know how you're feeling.
You don't!
Everybody has disappointments in life. Life is full of disappointments.
The moths are eating everything!
I don't doubt your feelings, but there's something impermanent about a caravan.
Everything on wheels must be on the move sooner or later.
Oh, hello, Mr. Portal, how are you?
How do you do, Miss Alison, how do you do?
Do you know Mr. Colpeper?
Yes, I know Mr. Colpeper, I knew his father.
How do you do, Mr. Tom?
How are you, Mr. Portal?
Miss Alison, why didn't you leave us your address?
Two weeks ago, Mr. Geoffrey's father came here.
He came here all the way from Artford.
He didn't want the caravan? He can't have it!
It was Mr. Geoffrey's wish that I should have it.
Well, you were a witness, you were there when he said it.
No, no, it's quite all right, Miss Alison. He doesn't want the caravan, he wants to get in touch with you.
I told him that we'd received a letter from you and that you were coming here.
He's waited for you.
He's staying at the Falstaff. For over two weeks, now, he's waited for you, here in Canterbury.
Why?
Because he has news, Miss Alison, official news, about Mr. Geoffrey.
He's in Gibraltar.
Miss Alison?
I must open the windows!
The caravan's full of moths!
They're ruining everything.
I haven't seen so many moths in all my life. Mr. Colpeper?
Where's Mr. Colpeper?
He's gone, Miss Alison.
Hey!
Why, you homesick, sad sack GI.
Hey, what in Canterbury have you been doing with your three days' leave?
Learning, Sergeant, learning.
Since when did you ever learn anything except from the Indians?
Hey, can I shoot inside?
We'll ask the verger.
The what?
The verger, he's the number one man around here.
Oh. Hey, you know what you missed in London?
Night clubs like New Yorkâ¦
You've never been in New York.
Oh, and girls, and telephone numbers, well, I got a million of them.
You know about the old road?
That's a new one on me.
Where is it, Piccadilly?
Piccadilly?
It's a road, a real one.
Okay, what about it?
It's the Pilgrims Road.
Gee, even you know about the Canterbury pilgrims.
Yeah, now I seem to remember flunking that.
Where does it go to, this old road?
You're standing on it. It goes right here to Canterbury Cathedral.
Come on in, you're a pilgrim yourself but you don't know it.
Hey, let's have some tea first, huh?
That stuff?
Sure, it's a habit, like marijuana.
I'll take marijuana.
You'll drink tea and like it.
I'll drink it but I won't like it.
There, you Canterbury pilgrim, you can sit right there and watch the world go by, like in the movies.
Hey, Betty.
What's cooking?
I beg your pardon?
You know, what do you got to eat in the kitchen?
Scones and rock buns.
All right, bring us an order of each and some tea.
And look, when you're spooning out the tea, don't forget, one for him, one for meâ¦
And one for the pot.
One for the pot.
Looks like she made the original pilgrimage.
Now, look, let me get this straight. You came here by road, not by train?
I came by train but the pilgrims used the old road.
Uh huh, why?
For blessings, you character, for blessings.
Okay, where's yours?
Uh uh, it don't work nowadays. That was 600 years ago.
You see, it's just like I've been saying. Here you are, 600 years too late.
You passed up 72 sleepless hours in London, and you ain't even got a blessing.
Yes sir, you're completely and positivelyâ¦
It don't work nowadays, huh?
Hey, do I look like a heavenly messenger to you?
You look like Mickey Roczinski to me.
Oh, yeah?
Well, I, Mickey Roczinski, have a blessing for you.
Oh, no, I've been carrying these around for two days.
Give me those letters.
The whole lot came in the mail the afternoon you left, from your girl.
Hey, what stamps are these?
Australia. - Australia?
Yeah, she certainly gets around.
These were mailed in Sydney, Australia. She's joined the WACs.
It's your Superintendent Hall, want him?
In 293, 293.
Onward, Christian soldiers, marching as to war.
â" Onward Christian soldiers â" Marching as to war â" With the cross of Jesus â" Going on before
â" Christ the royal master â" Leads against the foe â" Forward into battle â" See His banners go
â" Onward Christian soldiers â" Marching as to war â" With the cross of Jesus â" Going on before â"
Why, hello there, Mr. Neff.
Working pretty late, aren't you, Mr.Neff?
Late enough. Let's ride.
You look kind of all in, at that. - I'm fine.
How is the insurance business, Mr.Neff?
Okay.
They wouldn't ever sell me any. They said I have something loose in my heart. - I say it's rheumatism.
Yeah?
Twelve.
Office memorandum.
Walter Neff to Barton Keyes, Claims Manager.
Los Angeles, July 16, 1938.
Dear Keyes...
I suppose you'll call this a confession when you hear it.
Well, I don't like the word confession.
I just want to set you right about something you couldn't see... because it was smack up against your nose.
You think you're such a hot potato as a Claims Manager... such a wolf on a phony claim.
Maybe you are, but let's take a look at that Dietrichson claim.
Accident and double indemnity.
You were pretty good in there for a while, Keyes.
You said it wasn't an accident.
You said it wasn't suicide. Check.
You said it was murder.
Check.
You thought you had it cold, didn't you?
All wrapped up in tissue paper, with pink ribbons around it.
It was perfect.
Except it wasn't, because you made one mistake... just one little mistake.
When it came to picking the killer, you picked the wrong guy.
You want to know who killed Dietrichson?
Hold tight to that cheap cigar of yours, Keyes.
I killed Dietrichson.
Me, Walter Neff, insurance salesman.
35 years old, unmarried, no visible scars... until a while ago, that is.
Yes, I killed him.
I killed him for money... and for a woman.
And I didn't get the money and I didn't get the woman.
Pretty, isn't it?
It all began last May.
Around the end of May, it was.
I'd been out to Glendale to deliver a policy on some dairy trucks.
On the way back I remembered this auto renewal near Los Feliz Boulevard.
So I drove over there.
It was one of those California Spanish houses... everyone was nuts about 10 or 15 years ago.
This one must've cost somebody about $30,000.
That is, if he ever finished paying for it.
Is Mr. Dietrichson in?
Who wants to see him?
My name is Neff. Walter Neff.
If you're selling something--
Look, it's Mr. Dietrichson I want to talk to... and it's not magazine subscriptions.
Listen, Mr. Dietrichson is not in.
How soon do you expect him?
He'll be home when he gets here, if that's any help to you.
What is it, Nettie? Who is it?
It's for Mr. Dietrichson.
I'm Mrs. Dietrichson. What is it?
How do you do, Mrs. Dietrichson?
I'm Walter Neff, Pacific All Risk.
Pacific all what?
The Pacific All Risk Insurance Company.
It's about some renewals on the automobiles.
I've been trying to contact your husband for the past two weeks... but he's never in his office.
ls there anything I can do?
The insurance ran out on the 15th. I'd hate to think of your having a smashed fender... or something while you're not... fully covered.
Perhaps I know what you mean, Mr. Neff.
I've just been taking a sunbath.
No pigeons around, I hope.
About those policies, Mrs. Dietrichson, I hate to take up your time, but...
Oh, that's all right. If you'll wait till I put something on, I'll be right down.
Nettie, show Mr. Neff into the living room.
Where would the living room be?
In there, but they keep the liquor locked up.
It's all right. I always carry my own keys.
The living room was still stuffy... from last night's cigars.
The windows were closed... and the sunshine coming in through the venetian blinds... showed up the dust in the air.
On the piano, in a couple of fancy frames, were Mr. Dietrichson and Lola... his daughter by his first wife.
They had a bowl of those little red goldfish... on the table behind the big davenport.
But to tell you the truth, Keyes. .. I wasn't a whole lot interested in goldfish right then.
Or in auto renewals, or in Mr. Dietrichson and his daughter Lola.
I was thinking about that dame upstairs, and the way she had looked at me... and I wanted to see her again, close... without that silly staircase between us.
I wasn't long, was I?
Not at all, Mrs. Dietrichson.
Hope I've got my face on straight.
It's perfect, for my money.
Neff is the name, isn't it?
Yeah.
With two "F's," like in Philadelphia, if you know the story.
What story?
The Philadelphia Story.
Suppose we sit down and you tell me about the insurance.
My husband never tells me anything.
Well, it's on your two cars, the LaSalle and the Plymouth.
We've been handling this insurance for Mr. Dietrichson for three years... and we'd hate to see the policies lapse.
That's a honey of an anklet you're wearing, Mrs. Dietrichson.
As I was saying, we'd hate to see the policies lapse.
Of course, we give them 30 days. That's all we're allowed to give.
I guess he's been too busy down at Long Beach in the oil fields.
Couldn't I catch him at home some evening for a few minutes?
I suppose so. But he's never home much before 8:00.
That's fine with me.
You're not connected with the Automobile Club, are you?
No, the All Risk, Mrs. Dietrichson. Why?
Somebody from the Automobile Club has been trying to get him.
Do they have a better rate?
If your husband's a member.
No, he isn't.
Well, then he'd have to join the club and pay the membership fee to start with.
I never knock the other fellow's merchandise, Mrs. Dietrichson.
The Automobile Club's fine. I can do just as well for you, though.
I have a very attractive policy here.
It wouldn't take me two minutes to put it in front of your husband.
For instance, we're writing a new kind of 50 % retention feature... in the collision coverage.
You're a smart insurance man, aren't you, Mr. Neff?
Well, I've been at it 11 years.
Doing pretty well?
It's a living.
You handle just automobile insurance, or all kinds?
Fire, earthquake, theft, public liability, group insurance... industrial stuff and so on, right down the line.
Accident insurance? Accident insurance?
Sure, Mrs. Dietrichson.
Wish you'd tell me what's engraved on that anklet.
Just my name.
As, for instance?
Phyllis.
Phyllis, huh?
I think I like that.
But you're not sure?
I'd have to drive it around the block a couple of times.
Mr. Neff, why don't you drop by tomorrow evening around 8:30?
He'll be in then.
Who?
My husband. You were anxious to talk to him, weren't you?
Yeah, I was, but I'm sort of getting over the idea... if you know what I mean.
There's a speed limit in this state, Mr. Neff. 45 miles an hour.
How fast was I going, officer?
I'd say around 90.
Suppose you get down off your motorcycle and give me a ticket.
Suppose I let you off with a warning this time.
Suppose it doesn't take.
Suppose I have to whack you over the knuckles.
Suppose I bust out crying and put my head on your shoulder.
Suppose you try putting it on my husband's shoulder.
That tears it.
8:30 tomorrow evening then. - That's what I suggested.
Will you be here, too?
I guess so, I usually am.
Same chair, same perfume, same anklet?
I wonder if I know what you mean.
I wonder if you wonder.
It was a hot afternoon and I can still remember... the smell of honeysuckle all along that street.
How could I have known that murder can sometimes smell like honeysuckle?
Maybe you would have known, Keyes... the minute she mentioned accident insurance, but I didn't.
I felt like a million.
I went back to the office to see if I had any mail.
It was the day you had that truck driver from Inglewood on the carpet.
Remember, Keyes?
Mr. Neff, Mr. Keyes wants to see you.
He's been yelling for you all afternoon.
Is he sore, or just frothing at the mouth a little?
Park this for me, will you, sweetheart?
Hello, Walter.
Hi, George.
Come on. Come on, Garlopis. You're not kidding anybody with that line of bull.
You're in a jam and you know it.
Says you. - All I want is my money.
Says you. All you're gonna get is the cops.
Hello, Walter.
This is Sam Garlopis from Inglewood.
Sure, I know Mr. Garlopis.
Wrote a policy on his truck.
How are you, Mr. Garlopis?
I ain't so good. My truck burned down.
Yeah. Now look, Garlopis.
Every month hundreds of claims come to this desk.
Some of them are phonies, and I know which ones.
How do I know?
Because my little man tells me.
What little man?
The little man in here.
Every time one of these phonies comes along, it ties knots in my stomach.
I can't eat.
Yours is one of them, Garlopis. That's how I knew your claim was crooked.
So what did I do?
I sent a tow car over to your garage this afternoon... and they 'yanked up that burned-out truck of yours.
And what did they find? They found what was left of a neat pile of shavings.
What shavings?
The ones you soaked with kerosene and dropped a match on.
Look, Mister, I'm just a poor guy.
Maybe I made a mistake.
That's one way of putting it.
I ain't feeling so good, Mr. Keyes.
Here. Just a minute. Sign this and you'll feel fine.
Sign what?
It's a waiver on your claim.
Right here.
Here?
Here.
Now you're an honest man again.
Goodbye, Garlopis.
But I ain't got no more truck.
$2,600 is lot of dough where I live.
What's the matter, Garlopis, don't you know how to open the door?
Just put your hand on the knob, turn it to the left.
Now pull it toward you.
That's the boy.
Thank you, Mr. Keyes.
What kind of an outfit is this, anyway?
Are we an insurance company, or just a bunch of dimwitted amateurs... to write a policy on a mug like that?
Now, wait a minute, Keyes. I don't rate this beef.
I clipped a note to that Garlopis application... to have him thoroughly investigated... - before we accepted the risk.
I know you did, Walter. I'm not beefing at you.
It's the company. It's the way they do things.
The way they don't do things!
The way they'll write anything just to get it down on the sales sheet.
And I'm the guy that has to sit here up to my neck in phony claims... so they won't throw more money out the window than they take in at the door.
Okay, turn the record over, let's hear the other side.
Well, I get darn sick of trying to pick up after a gang of fast-talking salesmen... dumb enough to sell life insurance to a guy... who sleeps in the same bed with four rattlesnakes.
Walter, I've had 26 years of this and let me tell you, I'm getting--
Yeah, and you've loved every minute of it, Keyes.
You love it, only you worry about it too darn much, you and your little man.
You're so darn conscientious, you're driving yourself crazy.
You wouldn't even say today is Tuesday unless you looked at the calendar.
Then you'd check to see if it was this year's or last year's calendar.
Then you'd find out who printed the calendar... and find out if their calendar checked with the World Almanac's calendar.
Now, that's enough from you, Walter.
Now, get out of here before I throw my desk at you.
I love you, too.
I really did, too, you old crab... always yelling your head off, always sore at everybody.
But you never fooled me with your song and dance. Not for a second.
I kind of always knew that behind the cigar ashes on your vest... you had a heart as big as a house.
Back in my office there was a phone message from Mrs. Dietrichson... about the renewals.
She didn't want me to come tomorrow evening.
She wanted me to come Thursday afternoon at 3:30 instead.
I had a lot of stuff lined up for that Thursday afternoon... including a trip down to Santa Monica... to see a couple of live prospects about some group insurance.
But I kept thinking about Phyllis Dietrichson... and the way that anklet of hers out into her leg.
Hello, Mr. Neff. Aren't you coming in?
I'm considering it.
I hope you didn't mind my changing the appointment.
Last night wasn't so convenient.
That's all right. I was working on my stamp collection anyway.
I was just fixing some iced tea. Would you like a glass?
Yeah, unless you've got a bottle of beer that's not working.
There may be some. I never know what's in the icebox.
Nettie.
About those renewals, Mr. Neff. I talked to my husband about it.
Oh, you did?
Yes. He'll renew with you, he told me so.
As a matter of fact, I thought he'd be here this afternoon.
But he's not?
That's terrible.
Nettie!
Oh, I forgot, today's the maids day off.
Never mind the beer. Iced tea will be fine.
Lemon?
Sugar? - Fix it your way.
As long as it's the maid's day off, maybe there's something I can do for you.
Like running the vacuum cleaner.
Fresh.
I used to peddle vacuum cleaners.
Not much money, but you learn a lot about life.
I didn't think you'd learned it from a correspondence course.
Where'd you pick up this tea drinking?
You're not English, are you?
No. Californian.
Born right here in Los Angeles.
They say all native Californians come from Iowa.
Mr. Neff, I--
Make it Walter, huh?
Walter.
Tell me, Walter, on this insurance, how much commission do you make?
Twenty percent. Why?
I thought perhaps I could throw a little more business your way.
I can always use it.
I was thinking about my husband.
I worry a lot about him down in those oil fields.
It's very dangerous.
Not for an executive, is it?
He doesn't just sit behind a desk.
He's right down there with those drilling crews.
It's got me worried sick.
You mean, some dark night a crown block might fall on him?
Please don't talk like that.
But that's the idea.
The other day a casing line snapped and caught the foreman.
He's in the hospital with a broken back.
That's bad.
It's got me jittery just thinking about it.
Suppose something like that happened to my husband.
It could.
don't you think he ought to have accident insurance?
What kind of insurance could he have?
Enough to cover doctors and hospital bills. Say $125 a week cash benefit.
And he'd rate around $50,000 capital sum.
Capital sum?
What's that?
In case he gets killed.
Maybe I shouldn't have said that.
I suppose you have to think of everything in your business.
Well, your husband would understand.
I'm sure I could sell him on the idea of some accident protection.
Why don't I talk to him about it?
You could try, but he's pretty tough-going.
They're all tough at first.
He has a lot on his mind.
He doesn't seem to want to listen to anything... except maybe a baseball game on the radio.
Sometimes we sit here all evening and never say a word to each other.
Sounds pretty dull.
So, I just sit and knit.
Is that what you married him for?
Maybe I like the way his thumbs hold up the wool.
Anytime his thumbs get tired...
Only, with me around, you wouldn't have to knit.
Wouldn't I?
You bet your life, you wouldn't.
Wonder if a little rum would get this up on its feet.
I want to ask you something, Walter.
Could I get an accident policy for him without bothering him at all?
How's that, again?
It would make it easier for you, too. You wouldn't even have to talk to him.
I have a little allowance of my own.
I could pay for it and he needn't know anything about it.
Why shouldn't he know?
Because he doesn't want accident insurance.
He's superstitious about it.
A lot of people are. That's funny, isn't it?
If there was a way to get it like that, all the worry would be over.
See what I mean, Walter?
Sure. I got good eyesight.
You mean you want him to have the policy without him knowing it.
And that means without the insurance company knowing that he doesn't know it.
That's the setup, isn't it?
Is there anything wrong with it?
No, I think it's lovely.
Then, if some dark, wet night, that crown block did fall on him--
What crown block?
Only sometimes it can't quite make it on its own, it has to have a little help.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Of course, it doesn't have to be a crown block.
It can be a car backing over him, or he could fall out of the upstairs window.
Any little thing like that, just so it's a morgue job.
Are you crazy?
Not that crazy.
Goodbye, Mrs. Dietrichson.
What's the matter?
Look, baby, you can't get away with it.
You want to knock him off, don't you?
That's a horrible thing to say.
What'd you think I was, anyway?
A guy that walks into a good looking dame's front parlor and says: "Good afternoon, I sell accident insurance on husbands.
You got one that's been around too long? "One you'd like to turn into a little hard cash?
Just give me a smile and I'll help you collect."
Boy, what a dope you must think I am.
I think you're rotten.
I think you're swell, so long as I'm not your husband.
Get out of here.
You bet I'll get out of here, baby. I'll get out of here, but quick.
So I let her have it straight between the eyes.
She didn't fool me for a minute, not this time.
I knew I had hold of a red-hot poker... and the time to drop it was before it burned my hand off.
I stopped at a drive-in for a bottle of beer, the one I had wanted all along... only I wanted it worse now, to get rid of the sour taste of her iced tea... and everything that went with it.
I didn't want to go back to the office so I dropped by a bowling alley... at Third and Western and rolled a few lines... to get my mind thinking about something else for a while.
I didn't feel like eating dinner when I left, and I didn't feel like a show.
So, I drove home, put the car away and went up to my apartment.
It had begun to rain outside and I watched it get dark... and didn't even turn on the light.
That didn't help me either.
I was all twisted up inside... and I was still holding on to that red-hot poker.
And right then it came over me that I hadn't walked out on anything at all.
That the hook was too strong... that this wasn't the end between her and me.
It was only the beginning.
So at 8:00 the bell would ring and I'd know who it was without even having to think.
As if it was the most natural thing in the world.
Hello. You forgot your hat this afternoon.
Did I?
Don't you want me to bring it in?
Sure.
Put it on the chair.
How'd you know where I live?
It's in the phone book.
It's raining.
Yeah.
Peel off your coat and sit down.
Your husband out?
Yes. Long Beach. They're spudding in a new well.
He phoned he'd be late. About 9:30.
It's about time you said you were glad to see me.
I knew you wouldn't leave it like that.
Like what?
Like it was this afternoon.
I must have said something that gave you a terribly wrong impression.
You must never think anything like that about me, Walter.
Okay. - No, it's not okay. Not if you don't believe me.
What do you want me to do?
I want you to be nice to me.
Like the first time you came to the house.
It can't be like the first time.
Something's happened. - I know it has.
It's happened to us.
I feel as if he was watching me.
Not that he cares. Not anymore.
He keeps me on a leash so tight I can't breathe.
He's in Long Beach, isn't he?
Maybe I oughtn't to have come.
Maybe you oughtn't.
You want me to go?
If you want to.
Right now?
Sure, right now.
I'm crazy about you, baby.
I'm crazy about you, Walter.
That perfume on your hair. What's the name of it?
I don't know. I bought it in Ensenada.
You ought to have some of that pink wine to go with it.
The kind that bubbles.
All I got is bourbon.
Bourbon is fine, Walter.
Get a couple of glasses, will you?
Club soda?
Plain water, please.
You know, about six months ago a guy slipped on a cake of soap in his bathtub... and knocked himself cold and was drowned.
Only he had accident insurance.
So they had an autopsy and she didn't get away with it.
Who didn't?
His wife.
Then there was a case of a guy who was found shot.
His wife said he was cleaning a gun and his stomach got in the way.
All she collected was a three-to-ten stretch in Tehachapi.
Perhaps it was worth it to her.
See if you can carry that as far as the living room.
It's nice here, Walter. Who takes care of it for you?
A colored woman comes in a couple of times a week.
Cook your own breakfast?
Squeeze a grapefruit once in a while.
Get the rest down at the corner drugstore.
Sounds wonderful.
Just strangers beside you.
You don't know them and you don't hate them.
You don't have to sit across the table... and smile at him and that daughter of his every morning of your life.
What daughter?
You mean the little girl on the piano?
Lola. She lives with us.
He thinks a lot more of her than he does of me.
You ever think of a divorce?
He wouldn't give me a divorce.
I suppose because it'd cost him too much money.
He hasn't got any money. Not since he went into the oil business.
But he had when you married him?
Yes, he had.
And I wanted a home. Why not?
But that's not the only reason.
I was his wife's nurse. She was sick a long time.
When she died, he was terribly broken up. - I pitied him so.
And now you hate him.
Yes, Walter.
He's so mean to me.
Every time I buy a dress or a pair of shoes he yells his head off.
He never lets me go anywhere. He keeps me shut up.
He's always been mean to me.
Even his life insurance all goes to that daughter of his.
That Lola.
Nothing for you at all?
No. And nothing is just what I'm worth to him.
So you lie awake in the dark and listen to him snore and get ideas.
Walter, I don't want to kill him. I never did.
Not even when he gets drunk and slaps my face.
Only sometimes you wish he was dead.
Perhaps I do.
Then you wish it was an accident, and you had that policy for $50,000.
Is that it?
Perhaps that, too.
The other night we drove home from a party.
He was drunk again.
When we drove into the garage, he just sat there with his head on the steering wheel... and the motor still running.
And I thought what it would be like if I didn't switch it off... just closed the garage doors and left him there.
I'll tell you what it'd be like.
If you had that accident policy and tried to pull a monoxide job...
We've got a guy in our office named Keyes.
For him a setup like that'd be just like a slice of rare roast beef.
In three minutes he'd know it wasn't an accident.
In 10 minutes you'd be sitting under the hot lights.
In a half-hour you'd be signing your name to a confession.
But, Walter, I didn't do it and I'm not going to do it.
Not if there's an insurance company in the picture, baby.
They know more tricks than a carload of monkeys.
And if there's a death mixed up in it, you haven't got a prayer.
They'll hang you just as sure as ten dimes will buy a dollar.
And I don't want you to hang, baby.
Stop thinking about it, will you?
So we just sat there.
She started crying softly, like the rain on the window, and we didn't say anything.
Maybe she had stopped thinking about it, but I hadn't. I couldn't.
Because it all tied up with something I'd been thinking about for years.
Since long before I ever ran into Phyllis Dietrichson.
Because you know how it is, Keyes.
In this business you can't sleep... for trying to figure out all the tricks they could pull on you.
You're like the guy behind the roulette wheel... watching the customers to make sure they don't crook the house.
And then one night, you get to thinking how you could crook the house yourself.
And do it smart.
Because you've got that wheel right under your hands.
You know every notch in it by heart.
And you figure all you need is a plant out front.
A shill to put down the bet.
And suddenly the doorbell rings... and the whole setup is right there in the room with you.
Look, Keyes, I'm not trying to whitewash myself.
I fought it, only I guess I didn't fight it hard enough.
The stakes were $50,000, but they were the life of a man, too.
A man who'd never done me any dirt, except... he was married to a woman he didn't care anything about.
And I did.
Will you phone me?
Walter?
I hate him. I loathe going back to him.
You believe me, don't you, Walter?
Sure I believe you.
I can't stand it anymore. What if they did hang me?
They're not going to hang you, baby.
It's better than going on this way.
They're not gonna hang you because... you're gonna do it and I'm gonna help you.
Do you know what you're saying?
Sure, I know what I'm saying.
We're gonna do it and we're gonna do it right.
And I'm the guy that knows how.
Walter, you're hurting me.
There's not going to be any slip-up.
Nothing sloppy. Nothing weak.
It's got to be perfect.
Call me tomorrow. But not from your house. From a booth.
And watch your step every single minute.
This has got to be perfect, you understand?
Straight down the line.
That was it, Keyes.
The machinery had started to move and nothing could stop it.
The first thing we had to do was fix him up with that accident policy.
I knew he wouldn't buy, but all I wanted was his signature on an application.
Sol had to get him to sign without his knowing what he was signing.
And I wanted another witness besides Phyllis to hear me give him a sales talk.
I was trying to think with your brains, Keyes... because I wanted all the answers ready... for all the questions you were gonna spring as soon as Dietrichson was dead.
A couple of nights later I went to the house.
Everything looked fine, except I didn't like the witness Phyllis had brought in.
It was Dietrichson's daughter, Lola.
And it made me feel a little queer in the belly... to have her sitting right there in the room, playing Chinese checkers... as if nothing were going to happen.
I suppose you realize, Mr. Dietrichson... that, not being an employee... you are not covered by the State Compensation Insurance Act.
The only way you can protect yourself is by having a personal policy of your own.
Yeah, I know all about that.
The next thing you'll tell me I need... earthquake insurance and lightning insurance and hail insurance.
If we bought all the insurance they can think up... we'd stay broke paying for it, wouldn't we, honey?
What keeps us broke is you going out and buying five hats at a crack.
Who needs a hat in California?
Dollar for dollar, Mr. Dietrichson... accident insurance is the cheapest coverage you can buy.
Well, maybe some other time, Mr. Neff. I had a tough day.
Just as you say.
Suppose we just settle that automobile insurance tonight.
Sure.
All we'll need on that is for you to sign the application for renewal.
Phyllis, do you mind if we don't finish this game?
It bores me stiff.
Got something better to do?
Yes, I have.
Father, is it all right if I run along now?
Run along where?
Who with?
Just Anne. We're going roller-skating.
Anne who?
Anne Matthews.
It's not that Nino Zachetti again, is it?
It better not be that Zachetti guy.
If I ever catch you with that--
It's Anne Matthews, I told you.
And I also told you we're going roller-skating.
I'm meeting her at the corner of Vermont and Franklin, the northwest corner... in case you're interested, and I'm late already.
I hope that's all quite clear.
Good night, Father. - Good night, Phyllis.
Good night, Miss Dietrichson.
I'm sorry. Good night, Mr...
Neff.
Good night, Mr. Neff.
A great little fighter for her weight.
Now, if you'll just sign these, Mr. Dietrichson.
Sign what?
The applications for the auto renewals.
So you'll be covered until the new policies are issued.
When will that be?
About a week.
Just so I'm covered when I drive up north.
San Francisco?
Palo Alto.
He was a Stanford man, Mr. Neff. And he still goes to his class reunion every year.
What's wrong with that?
Can't I have a little fun, even once a year?
Great football school, Stanford.
Did you play football, Mr. Dietrichson?
Left guard. Almost made the varsity, too.
Where do I sign?
The bottom line.
Both copies, please.
Sign twice, huh?
Yes. One is the agent's copy. - I need it for my files.
Files.Duplicates. Triplicates.
Thank you, Mr. Dietrichson.
Don't worry about the check, I can pick it up at your office some morning.
How much you taking me for?
$147.50. I think that's enough insurance for one evening, Mr. Neff.
Plenty.
Bring me some soda when you come up, Phyllis.
Good night, Mr. Neff.
Good night, Mr. Dietrichson.
I think you left your hat in the hall, Mr. Neff.
Good night, Mr. Neff.
All right, Walter?
Fine. - He signed it, didn't he?
Sure he signed it. You saw him.
Now, listen. That trip to Palo Alto.
When does he leave?
End of the month.
He drives, huh?
He always drives. Not this time.
You're gonna make him take the train.
Why? - Because it's all worked out for a train.
Listen, baby.
There's a clause in every accident policy... a little thing called double indemnity.
The insurance companies put it in as a sort of come-on for the customers.
That means they pay double on certain accidents.
The kind that almost never happen.
Like for instance, if a guy is killed on the train... they pay $100,000 instead of $50,000.
I see.
We're hitting it for the limit, baby. That's why it's got to be the train.
It'll be the train, Walter. Just the way you want it.
Straight down the line.
Hello, Mr. Neff.
It's me.
Is anything wrong?
I've been waiting for you.
For me?
Why? I thought you could let me ride with you, if you're going my way.
Which way would that be?
Down the hill. Down Vermont.
Sure. Vermont and Franklin. Northwest corner, wasn't it?
Be glad to, Miss Dietrichson.
Going roller-skating, huh?
You like roller-skating?
I can take it or leave it.
Only tonight you're leaving it?
Yes, lam.
I'm having a very tough time at home.
My father doesn't understand me and Phyllis hates me.
Sounds tough, all right.
That's why I have to lie sometimes.
You mean it's not Vermont and Franklin?
It's Vermont and Franklin all right.
Only it's not Anne Matthews.
It's Nino Zachetti.
You won't tell on me, will you?
I'd have to think it over.
Nino's not what my father says at all. He's just had bad luck.
He was doing premed at USC... and working nights as an usher in a theater downtown.
Got behind in his credits, flunked out.
Then he lost his job for talking back.
He's so hot-headed.
Becomes expensive, doesn't it?
Guess my father thinks nobody's good enough for his daughter... except maybe the guy that owns Standard Oil.
I wish he'd see it my way.
I can't give Nino up.
It'll all straighten out, Miss Dietrichson.
I suppose it will sometime.
This is the corner right here, Mr. Neff.
Nino?
Over here, Nino.
This is Mr. Neff, Nino.
Hello, Nino.
The name is Zachetti.
Nino, please.
Mr. Neff gave me a ride from the house. I told him all about us.
Why does he have to get told about us?
We don't have to worry about Mr. Neff, Nino.
I'm not doing any worrying.
Just don't you broadcast so much.
Well, what's the matter with you, Nino?
Why, he's a friend. - I don't have any friends.
If I did, I like to pick them myself. Come on.
Look, sonny, she needed a ride, so I brought her along.
Is that anything to get tough about?
All right, Lola, make up your mind. Are you coming or aren't you?
Of course I'm coming.
Don't mind him, Mr. Neff. And thanks a lot for the ride.
You're awfully sweet.
Nino?
She was a nice kid.
Maybe he was a little better than he sounded.
But right then it gave me a nasty feeling to be thinking about them at all... with that briefcase right behind my head that had her father's signature in it... and what that signature meant.
It meant he was a dead pigeon.
It was only a question of time, and not very much time at that.
You know that big market up on Los Feliz, Keyes?
That's the place Phyllis and I had picked for a meeting place.
I already had most of the plan in my head... but a lot of details had to be worked out.
And she had to know them all by heart when the time came.
We had to be very careful from now on.
We couldn't let anybody see us together.
We couldn't even talk to each other on the telephone.
Not from her house or at my office, anyway.
So she was to be in the market every morning about 11:00, buying stuff.
And I could sort of run into her there any day I wanted to.
Sort of accidentally on purpose.
Walter, I wanted to--
I wanted to talk to you, ever since yesterday.
Let me talk first.
It's all set. The accident policy came through. I've got it in my pocket.
I got his check, too.
I saw him down in the oil fields. He thought he was paying for the auto insurance.
The check's just made out to the company, so it could be for anything.
But you have to send a check for the auto insurance, see?
It'll be all right that way, because one of the cars is in your name.
Open your bag.
Can you get in the safe-deposit box?
Yes. We both have keys.
Fine.
But don't put the policy in there yet. I'll tell you when.
Remember, you never saw it, you never even touched it, you understand?
I'm not a fool.
Okay. When is he leaving on the train?
That's just it. He isn't going.
What?
That's what I've been trying to tell you. The trip is off.
What happened?
Mister, could you reach me that package of baby food?
That one up there?
I don't know why they always put what I want on the top shelf.
Go ahead. I'm listening.
He had a fall-down at the well. Broke his leg. It's in a cast.
Broke his leg?
What do we do now, Walter?
Nothing. We just wait.
Wait for what?
Until he can take the train.
I told you it's got to be the train.
But we can't wait. I can't go on like this.
Look, we're not gonna grab a hammer and do it quick, just to get it over with.
There are other ways.
We're not gonna do it other ways.
But we can't leave it like this.
What do you suppose would happen if he found out about the accident policy?
Plenty. But not as bad as sitting in that death house.
Don't ever talk like that.
Don't let's start losing our heads, that's all.
It's not our heads. It's our nerve we're losing.
Excuse me.
We're gonna do it right. That's all I said.
It's the waiting that's getting me.
It's getting me just as bad, baby. - But we've got to wait.
Maybe we have, Walter, only... it's so tough without you.
It's like a wall between us.
I better go, baby.
I'm thinking of you every minute.
After that, a full week went by and I didn't see her once.
I tried to keep my mind off her and off the whole idea.
I kept telling myself that maybe those Fates they say watch over you... had gotten together and broken his leg to give me a way out.
Then it was the 15th of June.
You may remember that date, Keyes.
You came into my office around 3:00 in the afternoon.
Hello, Keyes.
I just came from Norton's office.
The semiannual sales records are out. You're high man, Walter.
That's twice in a row.
Congratulations.
Thanks.
How would you like a cheap drink?
How would you like a $50 cut in salary?
Do I laugh now or wait till it gets funny?
No, I'm serious. I've just been talking to Norton.
Too much stuff piling up on my desk.
Too much pressure on my nerves.
I spend half the night walking up and down in my bed.
I've got to have an assistant and I thought of you.
Me? Why pick on me?
Well, because I've got a crazy idea you might be good at the job.
That's crazy, all right. I'm a salesman.
Yeah.
A peddler, a gladhander, a backslapper.
You're too good to be a salesman.
Nobody's too good to be a salesman.
Phooey! All you guys do is just ring doorbells and dish out a smooth line of monkey talk.
What's troubling you is that $50 cut, isn't it?
Well, that'd trouble anybody.
Now look, Walter. The job I'm talking about takes brains and integrity.
It takes more guts than there is in 50 salesmen.
It's the hottest job in the business.
Yeah, but it's still a desk job.
I don't want to be nailed to a desk. - Deskjob?
Is that all you can see in it?
Just a hard chair to park your pants on from 9:00 to 5:00, huh?
Just a pile of papers to shuffle around, and five sharp pencils... and a scratch pad to make figures on, maybe a little doodling on the side.
Well, that's not the way I look at it, Walter.
To me, a claims man is a surgeon, that desk is an operating table... and those pencils are scalpels and bone chisels.
And those papers are not just forms and statistics and claims for compensation.
They're alive.
They're packed with drama... with twisted hopes and crooked dreams.
A claims man, Walter, is a doctor and a bloodhound and a--
Okay, hold on a minute.
A claims man is a doctor and a bloodhound and a cop and a judge and a jury... and a father confessor, all in one.
And you want to tell me you're not interested? You don't want to work with your brains?
All you want to work is with your finger on the doorbell... for a few bucks more a week.
Walter Neff speaking.
I had to call you, Walter. It's very urgent. Are you with somebody?
Yes, I am.
Can't I call you back, Margie?
No, you can't. I've only got a minute. It can't wait.
Listen. He's going tonight. On the train.
Are you listening? Walter? Yeah.
I'm listening, Margie.
Only, make it snappy, will you?
He's on crutches. The doctor says he can go if he's careful. The change will do him good.
It's wonderful, Walter. Just the way you wanted it, on a train.
Only with the crutches it makes it much better, doesn't it?
Yeah. Yeah, that's 100 % better.
Hold the line a minute, will you?
Keyes, suppose I join you in your office?
That's all right. I'll wait. Only tell her not to take all day.
Go ahead.
It's the 10:15 from Glendale. I'm driving him.
It's still the same dark street, isn't it?
And the signal is three honks on the horn.
Okay. Anything else?
No.
Oh, uh... what color did you pick?
Navy blue.
And the cast is on his left leg.
Mmm-hmm.
Yeah, that suits me fine.
This is it, Walter.
I'm shaking like a leaf. But it's straight down the line for both of us.
I love you, Walter. Goodbye.
Sorry, Keyes.
What's the matter?
Dames chasing you again?
Or still? Or is it none of my business?
If I told you it was a customer--
Margie. I bet she drinks from the bottle.
Why don't you settle down and get married, Walter?
Why don't you, for instance?
I almost did, once. Long time ago.
Now look, Keyes, I've got to call on a prospect.
Even had the church picked out, the dame and I.
She had a white satin dress with flounces on it.
I was on my way to the jewelry store to buy the ring.
And then suddenly that little man in here started working on me.
So you went back and had her investigated?
Yeah.
And the stuff that came out...
She'd been dyeing her hair ever since she was 16.
There was a manic depressive in her family, on her mother's side.
She already had one husband.
He was a professional pool player in Baltimore.
And as for her brother--
I get the general idea.
She was a tramp from a long line of tramps.
Yeah. All right, all right. Now what do I say to Norton?
What about this job I want you for'? I don't think I want it, Keyes. - Thanks just the same.
Fair enough.
Only get this, I picked you for the job... not because I think you're so darn smart... but because I thought you were a shade less dumb than the rest of the outfit.
Guess I was wrong.
You're not smarter, Walter. You're just a little taller.
Yes, Keyes.
Those Fates I was talking about had only been stalling me off.
Now they had thrown the switch.
The gears had meshed.
The time for thinking had all run out.
I wanted my movements accounted for up to the last possible moment.
So when I left the office I put my rate book on the desk as if I had forgotten it.
That was part of my alibi.
From here on, it was a question of following the timetable... move by move.
I got home about 7:00 and drove right into the garage.
This was another item to establish my alibi.
Hi, Mr. Neff.
Hello, Charlie.
How about giving the heap a wash job?
How soon you gonna want it?
I got a couple cars ahead of you.
Any time you get to it, Charlie. - I'm staying in tonight.
Okay.
Up in my apartment I called Lou Schwartz... one of the salesmen that shared my office.
He lived in Westwood, so it was a toll call and there'd be a record of it.
I told him I'd forgotten my rate book and needed some dope... on the public liability bond I was figuring.
I changed into a navy blue suit like Dietrichson was going to wear.
Lou Schwartz called me back and gave me a lot of figures.
I stuffed a hand towel and a roll of adhesive into my pockets... so I could fake something that looked like a cast on a broken leg.
Next, I stuck a card inside the telephone box... so that it would fall down if the bell rang.
That way I'd know if anybody had called me while I was away.
Then I did the same thing to the doorbell in case anybody came to see me.
I left the apartment by the service stairs.
Nobody saw me.
I walked all the way from my apartment to the Dietrichson house.
I didn't want to take the bus... because there was always the chance that someone might remember seeing me on it.
I was being that careful.
I could smell that honeysuckle again.
Only it was even stronger, now that it was night.
I slid the garage door open as quietly as I could.
She'd backed the sedan in, just the way I told her to.
I'd figured it was safer that way... in case he got into the car before she drove it out.
I got into the back of the car.
I lay there on the floor and waited.
All the time I was thinking about that dark street on the way to the station... where I was to do it... and the three honks on the horn that were to be the signal.
About 10 minutes later they came down.
All right, honey?
Yeah, I'm all right.
Take it easy, honey. - We've got lots of time.
Remember what the doctor said.
If you get careless... you might end up with a shorter leg.
So what?
I could break the other one and match them up again.
It makes you feel pretty good to get away from me, doesn't it?
It's only for four days. I'll be back Monday at the latest.
This is not the right street. Why did you turn here?
What are you doing that for?
What are you honking the horn for?
You take care of the redcap and the conductor.
Don't worry.
Keep away from me as much as you can.
Tell them I don't want to be helped.
I said, don't worry, Walter.
You start as soon as the train leaves.
When you get to the refinery, turn off the highway onto the dirt road.
From there it's exactly eight-tenths of a mile... to the dump beside the tracks.
Remember.
I remember everything.
No speeding.
You don't want any oops stopping you with him in the back.
Walter, we've been through all that so many times.
When you leave the highway, turn off all your lights.
I'll be back on the observation platform. I'll drop off as close to the spot as I can.
Let the train pass, then dim your lights twice.
San Francisco train, lady?
Car 9, section 11. Just my husband.
Car 9, section 11?
This way please.
Thank you. My husband doesn't like to be helped.
Car number 8. Up there.
Car 9, section 11.
Thank you.
Here're the tickets. Take good care of yourself with that leg.
Yeah. You take it easy driving home.
I'll miss you, honey.
Section 11, sir.
All aboard! - Thank you.
Goodbye, honey.
Good luck, honey.
Porter, will you make up my berth right away?
Yes, sir.
I'm going back to the observation oar for a smoke.
Right this way, sir.
Like a chair?
No, thanks.
I'd rather stand.
You going far?
Palo Alto.
My name's Jackson. I'm going all the way to Medford.
I had a broken arm once.
That darn cast itches something fierce, doesn't it?
I thought I'd go crazy with mine.
Palo Alto's a nice little town.
You a Stanford man?
I used to be.
I'll bet you left something behind.
I always do.
My cigar case.
I guess I left it in my overcoat back in the section.
Would you care to roll yourself a cigarette, Mister--
Dietrichson.
No thanks, I really prefer a cigar.
Maybe the porter could--
Well, I could get your cigars for you.
Be glad to, Mr. Dietrichson.
If it's not too much trouble.
Car 9, section 11.
Car 9, section 11. With pleasure.
Okay. This has gotta be fast.
Here, take his hat.
Pick up the crutches back on the tracks.
Okay, baby. That's it.
All right. Let's go.
On the way back, we went over once more... what she was to do at the inquest... if they had one, and about the insurance, when that came up.
I was afraid she might go to pieces a little, now that we had done it.
But she was perfect.
No nerves.
Not a tear, not even a blink of the eyes.
She dropped me a block from my apartment house.
Walter, what's the matter?
Aren't you going to kiss me?
It's straight down the line, isn't it?
I love you, Walter.
I love you, baby.
It was two minutes past 11:00, as I went up the service stairs again.
Nobody saw me this time either.
In the apartment I checked the bells. The cards hadn't moved.
No calls. No visitors.
Then I changed my clothes again.
That left one last thing to do.
I had to go down to the garage.
I wanted Charlie to see me again.
You gonna use your oar, after all?
I'm not quite through.
Well, that's all right, Charlie.
Just going up to the drugstore to get something to eat.
Been working upstairs all night. My stomach's getting a little sore at me.
Yes, sir, Mr. Neff.
That was all there was to it.
Nothing had slipped, nothing had been overlooked.
There was nothing to give us away.
And yet, Keyes, as I was walking down the street to the drugstore... suddenly it came over me that everything would go wrong.
It sounds crazy, Keyes, but it's true, so help me.
I couldn't hear my own footsteps.
It was the walk of a dead man.
That was the longest night lever lived through, Keyes... and the next day was worse, when the story had broke in the papers... and they started talking about it at the office... and the day after that, when you started digging into it.
I kept my hands in my pockets because I thought they were shaking.
I put on dark glasses so people couldn't see my eyes.
And then I took them off again so they wouldn't get to wondering why I wore them.
I tried to hold myself together, but...
I could feel my nerves pulling me to pieces.
Oh, Walter?
Hello, Keyes.
Come along. The big boss wants to see us.
The Dietrichson case?
Must be.
Anything wrong?
Well, the guy is dead.
We had him insured and it's gonna cost us dough.
That's always wrong. - What have they got so far?
Autopsy report.
No heart failure, no apoplexy, no predisposing medical cause of any kind.
Died of a broken neck.
When's the inquest?
Had it this morning.
His wife and daughter made the identification.
The train people and some of the passengers told how he went through... to the observation car.
It was all over in 45 minutes.
Verdict?
Accidental death.
What do the police figure?
That he got tangled up in his crutches and fell off the train.
They're satisfied.
It's not their dough.
Come on, Walter.
All right. Thank you very much, gentlemen.
I believe the legal position is now clear.
Please stand by. I may need you later.
Come in, Mr. Keyes.
You, too, Mr. Neff.
You find this an uncomfortably warm day, Mr. Keyes?
I'm sorry, Mr. Norton, but I didn't know this was formal.
Sit down, gentlemen.
Thank you. Any new developments?
I just talked to this Jackson long distance, up in Medford, Oregon.
Who's Jackson?
He's the last man who saw Dietrichson alive.
They were out on the observation platform together, talking.
Dietrichson wanted a cigar and so Jackson went back... to get Dietrichson's cigar case for him.
When he returned to the observation platform, no Dietrichson.
Well, Jackson didn't think anything was wrong until... a wire caught up with the train at Santa Barbara.
They found Dietrichson's body on the tracks near Burbank.
Very interesting about the cigar case.
Anything else? - No, not much.
Dietrichson's secretary says she didn't know anything about the policy.
There's a daughter, but all she remembers is Neff talking to her father... about accident insurance at their house one night.
I couldn't sell him at first.
Mr. Dietrichson opposed it. He said he'd think it over.
Later I saw him in the oil fields and closed him.
He signed the application and gave me his check.
A fine piece of salesmanship that was, Mr. Neff.
Well, there's no sense in pushing Neff around.
He's got the best sales record in the office.
Are your salesmen supposed to know a customer is going to fall off the train?
Fall off a train?
Are we sure Dietrichson fell off the train?
I don't get it.
You don't, Mr. Keyes?
Then what do you think of this case?
This policy might cost us a great deal of money.
As you know, it contains a double indemnity clause.
Just what is your opinion?
No opinion at all.
Not even a hunch?
One of those interesting little hunches of yours?
Nope. Not even a hunch.
I'm surprised, Mr. Keyes.
I've formed a very definite opinion.
I think I know. In fact, I know I know what happened to Dietrichson.
You know you know what?
I know it was not an accident.
What do you say to that?
Me?
Well, you've got the ball. Let's see you run with it.
There's a widespread feeling that just because a man has a large office--
Yes?
Have her come in, please.
There's a widespread feeling that... just because a man has a large office, he must be an idiot.
I'm having a visitor, if you don't mind.
No, no. I want you to stay and watch me handle this.
Mrs. Dietrichson.
Thank you very much for coming, Mrs. Dietrichson.
I assure you I appreciate it.
This is Mr. Keyes.
How do you do?
How do you do?
And Mr. Neff.
I've met Mr. Neff. How do you do?
Mrs. Dietrichson.
May I extend our sympathy in your bereavement?
I hesitated before asking you to come here so soon after your loss.
But now that you're here I hope you won't mind if I plunge straight into business?
You know why we asked you to come, don't you?
No. All I know is that your secretary made it sound very urgent.
Your husband had an accident policy with this company.
Evidently you don't know that, Mrs. Dietrichson.
No. I remember some talk at the house, but he didn't seem to want it.
Your husband took the policy out a few days later, Mrs. Dietrichson.
You'll probably find the policy among his personal effects.
His safe-deposit box hasn't been opened yet.
It seems a tax examiner has to be present.
Please, Mrs. Dietrichson, I don't want you to think... you're being subjected to any questioning... but there are a few things we should like to know.
What sort of things?
We have the report of the coroner's inquest. Accidental death.
We are not entirely satisfied.
In fact, we are not satisfied at all.
Frankly, Mrs. Dietrichson, we suspect... a suicide.
I'm sorry. Would you like a glass of water?
Please.
Thank you.
Had your husband been depressed or moody lately, Mrs. Dietrichson?
Did he have financial worries, for instance?
He was perfectly all right and I don't know of any financial worries.
Let us examine this so-called accident.
First, your husband takes out this policy in absolute secrecy.
Because he doesn't want his family to suspect what he intends to do.
Do what?
Next, he goes on this trip entirely alone.
He has to be alone.
He hobbles all the way out to the observation platform.
Very unlikely with his leg in a cast, unless he has a very strong reason.
Once there, he finds he is not alone.
There is a man there.
What was his name, Keyes?
His name was Jackson. Probably still is.
So he gets rid of this Jackson with some flimsy excuse about cigars.
And then he is alone. And then he does it.
Does what?
He jumps. Suicide.
In which case, the company is not liable.
You know that, of course.
Now, we could go to court--
I don't know anything. In fact, I don't know why I came here.
Just a moment, please. I said we could go to court.
I didn't say we want to.
What I want to suggest is a compromise on both sides.
A settlement for a certain sum, a part of the policy value.
Don't bother, Mr. Norton.
When I came in here, I had no idea you owed me any money.
You told me you did. Then you told me you didn't.
Now you tell me you want to pay me a part of it, whatever it is.
You want to bargain with me, at a time like this.
I don't like your insinuations about my husband, and I don't like your methods.
In fact, I don't like you, Mr. Norton.
Goodbye, gentlemen.
Nice going, Mr. Norton. You sure carried that ball.
Only you fumbled on the goal line.
Then you heaved an illegal forward pass and got thrown for a 40-yard loss.
Now you can't pick yourself up because you haven't got a leg to stand on.
I haven't, eh?
She can go to court and we can prove it was suicide.
Oh, can we?
Mr. Norton, the first thing that struck me was that suicide angle.
Only I dumped it into the wastepaper basket just three seconds later.
You know, you ought to take a look at the statistics on suicide sometime.
You might learn a little something about the insurance business.
Mr. Keyes, I was raised in the insurance business.
Yeah, in the front office.
Come now, you've never read an actuarial table in your life, have you?
Why, they've got 10 volumes on suicide alone.
Suicide by race, by color, by occupation... by sex, by seasons of the year, by time of day.
Suicide, how committed?
By poisons, by firearms, by drowning, by leaps.
Suicide by poison, subdivided by types of poison... such as corrosive, irritant, systemic, gaseous, narcotic... alkaloid, protein, and so forth.
Suicide by leaps, subdivided by leaps from high places... under the wheels of trains, under the wheels of trucks... under the feet of horses, from steamboats.
But, Mr. Norton... of all the cases on record there's not one single case of suicide by leap... from the rear end of a moving train.
And do you know how fast that train was going... at the point where the body was found?
15 miles an hour.
Now how can anybody jump off a slow moving train like that... with any kind of expectation that he would kill himself?
No. No soap, Mr. Norton.
We're sunk, and we'll have to pay through the nose, and you know it.
May I have this?
Come on, Walter.
Next time I'll rent a tuxedo.
I could have hugged you right then and there, Keyes... you and your statistics.
You were the only one we were really scared of... and instead you were almost playing on our team.
That evening when I got home, my nerves had eased off.
I could feel the ground under my feet again.
And it looked like easy going from there on in.
That $100,000 looked as safe for Phyllis and me... as if we had the check already deposited in the bank.
Hello?
Oh, hello, baby.
Sure, everything is fine.
You were wonderful in Norton's office.
I felt so funny, I wanted to look at you all the time.
How do you think I felt, baby? Where are you?
At the drugstore. Just a block away. - Can I come up?
Okay. But be careful. Don't let anybody see you.
Hello, Keyes.
What's on your mind?
That broken leg. - The guy had a broken leg. - What are you talking about?
Talking about Dietrichson.
He had accident insurance, didn't he?
Yeah.
Then he broke his leg, didn't he?
So what?
And he didn't put in a claim.
Why didn't he put in a claim?
Why? - What are you driving at?
Walter, I had dinner two hours ago and it stuck half way.
That little man of yours is acting up again, huh?
There's something wrong with the Dietrichson case. Why?
Because he didn't file a claim?
Maybe he just didn't have time.
Maybe he just didn't know that he was insured.
No. No, that couldn't be it.
You delivered the policy to him personally, didn't you?
Yeah.
You got his check?
Sure I did.
Got any bicarbonate of soda? - No, I haven't.
Walter, I've been living with this little man for 26 years.
And he's never failed me yet. There's got to be something wrong.
Well, maybe Norton was right. Maybe it was suicide.
No. Not suicide. - But not an accident, either.
What else? Now look, Walter.
A guy takes out an accident policy that's worth $100,000..
If he's killed on a train.
Then two weeks later, he is killed on a train.
And not in a train accident, mind you, but falling off some silly observation oar.
Do you know what the mathematical probability of that is?
One out of I don't know how many billions.
And add to that the broken leg.
No, it just can't be the way it looks.
Something has been worked on us.
Such as what?
Murder?
Don't you have any peppermint or something?
Sorry.
Want a little soda water?
No, no, no.
Who do you suspect?
Maybe I like to make things easy for myself.
But I always tend to suspect the beneficiary. - You mean the wife?
Yeah.
That wide-eyed dame that just didn't know anything about anything.
You're crazy, Keyes.
She wasn't even on the train.
I know she wasn't, Walter.
I don't claim to know how it was worked, or who worked it... but all I know is that it was worked.
I've got to get to a drugstore. This thing feels like a hunk of concrete inside me.
Good night, Walter.
Good night, Keyes.
See you at the office in the morning.
I'd like to move in on her right now, tonight.
If it wasn't for Norton and his striped-pants ideas about company policy...
I'd have the police after her so fast it'd make her head spin.
They'd put her through the wringer... and, brother, the things they would squeeze out.
Only you haven't got a single thing to go on, Keyes.
Not too much. Just 26 years experience... all the percentage there is, and this hunk cf concrete in my stomach.
Can I have one of those things?
Good night, Keyes.
So long, Walter.
How much does he know?
He doesn't know anything.
It's those stinking hunches of his.
And he can't prove anything, can he?
Not if we're careful. Not if we don't see each other for a while.
How long a while?
Until this dies down. You don't know Keyes.
Once he gets his teeth into something, he never lets go.
He'll investigate you, have you shadowed. He'll watch you every minute from now on.
You afraid, baby?
Yes, I'm afraid.
But not of Keyes. I'm afraid of us. We're not the same anymore.
We did it so we could be together, but instead of that it's pulling us apart.
What are you talking about?
And you don't really care whether we see each other or not.
Shut up, baby.
Hello, Mr. Neff.
Hello.
Lola Dietrichson. - Don't you remember me?
Yes. Yes, of course.
Could I talk with you just a few minutes?
Somewhere where we could be alone?
Oh, yes. Come into my office.
Is it something about what happened?
Yes, Mr. Neff.
It's about my father's death.
I'm terribly sorry, Miss Dietrichson.
Lou, do you mind if I use the office alone for a few minutes? No.
It's all yours, Walter.
Look at me, Mr. Neff.
I'm not crazy.
I'm not hysterical. I'm not even crying.
But I have the awful feeling that something is wrong... and I had that same feeling once before, when my mother died.
When your mother died?
We were at Lake Arrowhead. That was six years ago. We had a cabin there.
It was winter and very cold.
My mother was very sick with pneumonia. She had a nurse with her.
There were just the three of us in the cabin.
One night I got up and went into my mother's room.
She was delirious with fever.
All the bed covers were on the floor and the windows were wide open.
The nurse wasn't in the room.
I ran and covered my mother up as quickly as I could. Just then I heard a door open behind me.
The nurse stood there.
She didn't say a word, but there was a look in her eyes...
I'll never forget.
Two days later, my mother was dead.
Do you know who that nurse was?
No. Who? - Phyllis.
I tried to tell my father, but I was just a kid then.
Six months later she married him... and I kind of talked myself out of the idea she could have done anything like that.
But now it's all back again, now that something's happened to my father, too.
You're not making sense, Miss Dietrichson. Your father fell off a train.
Yes, and two days before he fell off that train, what was Phyllis doing?
She was in her room in front of a mirror, with a black hat on... pinning a black veil to it.
As if she couldn't wait to see how she would look in mourning.
You've had a pretty bad shock, Miss Dietrichson.
Aren't you just imagining these things?
I caught her eyes in the mirror.
They had that look in them they had before my mother died.
That same look.
You don't like your stepmother, do you?
Isn't it just because she is your stepmother?
I loathe her because she did it.
She did it for the money.
Only you're not going to pay her, are you, Mr. Neff?
She's not going to get away with it this time, because I'm going to speak up.
I'm going to tell everything I know.
You'd better be careful, saying things like--
I'm not afraid. You'll see.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to act like this.
All this that you've been telling me, who else have you told?
No one.
How about your stepmother?
Of course not.
I've moved out.
I'm not living at home anymore.
And you haven't told that boyfriend of yours? Zachetti?
I'm not seeing him anymore. We had a fight.
Where are you living now?
I got myself a little apartment in Hollywood.
Four walls, and you just sit and look at them?
Yes, Mr. Neff.
So that evening I took her to dinner... at a Mexican restaurant down on Olvera Street where nobody would see us.
I wanted to cheer her up.
The next day was Sunday and we went for a ride down to the beach.
She had loosened up a bit, she was even laughing.
I had to make sure that she wouldn't tell that stuff about Phyllis to anybody else.
It was dynamite, whether it was true or not.
And I had no chance to talk to Phyllis.
You were watching her like a hawk, Keyes.
I couldn't even phone her because I was afraid you had the wires tapped.
Monday morning there was a note on my desk that you wanted to see me, Keyes.
For a minute I wondered if it could be about Lola.
It was worse.
Outside your door was the last guy in the world I wanted to see.
Come in. Come in, Walter.
Hello, Keyes.
I want to ask you something.
After all the years we've known each other... do you mind if I make a rather blunt statement?
About what? - About me.
Walter, I'm a very great man.
Yeah? This Dietrichson business, it's murder... and murders don't come any neater.
As fancy a piece of homicide as anybody ever ran into... smart, tricky, almost perfect, but...
I think Papa has it all figured out.
Figured out and wrapped up in tissue paper with pink ribbons on it.
Go ahead. I'm listening.
You know what?
That guy Dietrichson was never on the train.
He wasn't?
No, he wasn't.
Now look, Walter.
You can't be sure of killing a man... by throwing him off a train that's going 15 miles an hour.
The only way you can be sure is to kill him first... and then throw his body on the tracks.
Now that would mean either killing him on the train... or, and this is where it really gets fancy, you kill him somewhere else... and put him on the tracks.
Two possibilities, and I personally buy the second.
You're way ahead of me, Keyes.
Well, look, Walter, it was like this.
They killed the guy, the wife and a somebody else... and the somebody else took the crutches and went on the train as Dietrichson... then the somebody else jumped off... then they put the body on the tracks where the train had passed.
An impersonation, see?
A cinch to work.
Because it was night, very few people were about... they have the crutches to stare at... they never really looked at the man at all.
Fancy all right, Keyes, but maybe it's a little too fancy.
Is it?
I tell you, it all fits together like a watch.
Now let's see what we have in the way of proof.
The only guy who really got a good look at this supposed Dietrichson... is sitting right outside my office.
I took the trouble to bring him down here from Oregon.
Come here, Mr. Jackson.
Yes, sir, Mr. Keyes.
These are fine cigars you smoke.
Two for a quarter. - That's what I said.
Well, did you study those photographs?
Yes, indeed.
I studied them thoroughly. - Very thoroughly.
Have you made up your mind?
Mister Keyes, I'm a Medford man. Medford, Oregon.
Up in Medford we take our time making up our mind.
Well, we're not in Medford now. We're in a hurry.
Let's have it.
Are these photographs of the late Mr. Dietrichson?
Yes.
Then my answer is no.
What do you mean, no?
I mean, this is not the man that was on the train.
Will you swear to that?
Mr. Keyes, I'm a Medford man. Medford, Oregon.
If I say it, I mean it. If I mean it, of course I'll swear it.
There you are, Walter. There's your proof.
This is Mr. Neff, one of our salesmen.
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Neff. Pleased, indeed.
How are you?
Very fine, thank you. - Never was better.
Sit down, Mr. Jackson. Just how would you describe the man you saw on the observation platform?
Well, I'm pretty sure he was a younger man... about 10 or 15 years younger than the man in these photographs.
Dietrichson was about 50, wasn't he, Walter?
Fifty-one, according to the policy.
The man I saw was nothing like 51 years old.
Of course, it was pretty dark out on that platform.
Come to think of it, he tried to keep his back towards me.
But I'm positive just the same. - Thank you, Jackson.
Of course, you understand this matter is strictly confidential?
We may need you again down here in Los Angeles, if the case comes to court.
Any time you need me, I'm entirely at your disposal, gentlemen.
Expenses paid, of course.
Oh, yes. Yes.
Get me Lubin, in the cashier's office. Hello, Lubin. This is Keyes.
Listen. I'm sending a man named Jackson down to you with an expense account.
Well, we brought him down here from Medford, Oregon in connection with... the Dietrichson claim.
Well, take care of his hotel bill, will you?
Ever been in Oregon, Mr. Neff? Yeah. He'll be right down.
Never been up there.
Wait a minute. You go trout fishing?
Maybe I saw you up Klamath Falls way.
Nope. I don't fish.
You don't go fishing, Mr. Neff.
Neff. It's the name.
There's a family of Neffs in Corvallis. - No relation.
Let me see.
This man's an automobile dealer in Corvallis.
A very reputable man, too, I'm told.
All right, Mr. Jackson. Suppose you go down to the cashier's office.
Room 27 on the 11th floor.
He'll take care of your expense account and your ticket for the train tonight.
Tonight?
Tomorrow morning would suit me better.
There's a very good osteopath in town... - I'd like to see before I leave.
Osteopath?
Well, just don't put her on the expense account.
Well, goodbye, gentlemen.
It's been a pleasure. - Goodbye.
There it is, Walter.
It's beginning to come apart at the seams already.
Murder's never perfect. Always comes apart sooner or later.
And when two people are involved, it's usually sooner.
Now, we know the Dietrichson dame is in it, and a somebody else.
Pretty soon we'll know who that somebody else is.
He'll show. He's got to show. Sometime, somewhere, they've got to meet.
Their emotions are all kicked up.
Whether it's love or hate doesn't matter.
They can't keep away from each other.
They may think it's twice as safe because there are two of them.
But it isn't twice as safe. It's 10 times twice as dangerous.
They've committed a murder... and it's not like taking a trolley ride together... where they can get off at different stops.
They're stuck with each other and they've got to ride... all the way to the end of the line.
And it's a one-way trip, and the last stop is the cemetery.
She put in her claim.
I'm gonna throw it right back at her.
Let her sue us if she dares.
I'll be ready for her and that somebody else.
They'll be digging their own graves.
Mrs. Dietrichson?
This is Jerry's Market.
We just got in a shipment of that English soap you were asking about.
Will you be coming by today?
Thank you, Mrs. Dietrichson.
Hello, Walter.
Come over here.
What's the matter?
Everything's the matter.
Keyes is rejecting your claim.
He's sitting back with his mouth watering, waiting for you to sue.
He wants you to sue, but you're not going to.
What's he got to stop me?
He's got plenty.
He's figured out how it was worked.
He knows it was somebody else on the train... and he's dug up a witness he thinks can prove it.
Prove it how?
If he rejects that claim, I have to sue.
Yeah? And then you're in court and a lot of other things are going to come up.
Like, for instance, about you and the first Mrs. Dietrichson.
What about me and the first Mrs. Dietrichson?
The way she died.
And about that black hat you were trying on before you needed a black hat.
Lola's been telling you some of her cockeyed stories.
She's been seeing you.
I've been seeing her, if you want to know.
So she won't yell her head off about what she knows.
She's putting on an act for you, crying all over your shoulder, the lying--
Keep her out of this.
All I'm telling you is we're not going to sue.
Because you don't want the money anymore... even if you could have it, because she's... made you feel like a heel all of a sudden?
It isn't the money anymore. It's our necks.
We're pulling out, do you understand?
Because of what Keyes can do?
You're not fooling me, Walter.
It's because of Lola, what you did to her father.
You're afraid she might find out someday and you can't take it, can you?
I said, leave her out of this.
It's me I'm talking about. - I don't want to be left out of it.
Stop saying that. It's just that it hasn't worked as we wanted. - We can't go through with it, that's all.
We have gone through with it. The tough part is all behind us.
We just have to hold on now and not go soft inside... stick close together the way we started out.
Watch it.
I loved you, Walter, and I hated him.
But I wasn't going to do anything about it, not until I met you.
You planned the whole thing.
I only wanted him dead.
And I'm the one that fixed it so he was dead.
Is that what you're telling me?
And nobody's pulling out.
We went into this together, we're coming out at the end together.
It's straight down the line for both of us, remember?
Yes, I remembered.
Just like I remembered what you had told me, Keyes... about that trolley car ride... and how there was no getting off till the end of the line where the cemetery was.
And then I got to thinking what cemeteries are for.
They're to put dead people in.
I guess that was the first time I ever thought about Phyllis that way.
Dead, I mean.
And how it would be if she were dead.
I saw Lola three or four times that week.
One night we went up into the hills behind the Hollywood Bowl.
I guess it sounds crazy, Keyes, but it was only with her that...
I could relax and let go a little.
Why are you crying?
Not gonna tell me, huh?
Of course I will, Walter. I wouldn't tell anybody else but you.
It's about Nino. - Zachetti?
What about him?
They killed my father together. He and Phyllis.
He helped her do it. I know he did.
What makes you say that?
I've been following him.
He's been to her house, night after night. It was Phyllis and him all along.
Maybe he was just going with me as a blind.
And the night of the murder--
You promised me you weren't gonna talk like this anymore.
He was supposed to pick me up after a lecture at UCLA.
But he never showed up. He said he was sick.
Sick!
He couldn't show up, because the train was leaving with my father on it.
Maybe I'm just crazy. Maybe it's all in my mind.
Sure, it's all in your mind.
I only wish it were, Walter, 'cause I still love him.
Zachetti.
Phyllis and Zachetti.
What was he doing up at her house?
I couldn't figure that one out.
I tried to make sense out of it and got nowhere.
But the real braintwister came the next day.
You sprang it on me, Keyes, after office hours, when you caught me... down in the lobby of the building.
Walter. Walter, just a minute.
Hello, Keyes.
Just hang on to your hat, Walter.
What for?
Oh, nothing much. That Dietrichson case just busted wide open.
How do you mean?
The guy showed. That's how.
What guy?
The guy who helped her do it.
The somebody else?
No kidding?
Yeah. She just filed suit against us.
It's okay by me.
When we get them in that courtroom, I'll tear them to pieces, both of them. - Come on.
I'll buy you a martini, Walter.
No thanks, Keyes.
With two olives.
No, I've got to get a shave and a shoeshine. I've got a date.
Margie.
I still bet she drinks from the bottle.
They give you matches when you buy cigars, you know. All you have to do is ask for them.
Don't like them, they always explode in my pocket.
I was scared stiff, Keyes.
Maybe you were playing cat- and-mouse with me.
Maybe you knew all along I was the somebody else.
I had to find out, and I knew where to look.
In your office.
Memo to Mr. Norton. Confidential. Dietrichson file.
With regard to your proposal to put Walter Neff under surveillance... I disagree absolutely.
I have investigated his movements on the night of the crime... and he's definitely placed in his apartment from 7:15 p.m. on.
In addition to this, I have known Neff intimately for 11 years... and I personally vouch for him without reservation.
Furthermore, no connection whatsoever has been established... between Walter Neff and Mrs. Phyllis Dietrichson... whereas I am now able to report that such a connection has been established... between her and another man.
This man has been observed to visit Mrs. Dietrichson... on the nights of July 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th and 13th.
We have succeeded in identifying him as one Nino Zachetti... former medical student, age of 28... residing at Lilac Court Apartments... 1228 1/2 North La Brea Avenue.
We have checked Zachetti's movements on the night of the crime... and have found that they cannot be accounted for.
I am preparing a more detailed report for your consideration.
It is my belief that we already have sufficient evidence against Zachetti... and Mrs. Dietrichson to justify police action.
I strongly urge that this whole matter be turned over to the office... of the district attorney.
Respectfully, Barton Keyes.
Phyllis? It's Walter. I've got to see you.
Yes, it has to be tonight.
How's 11:00?
Don't worry about Keyes.
Just leave the front door unlocked and put the lights out.
No, nobody's watching the house. Not anymore.
It's just for the neighbors.
I told you not to worry about Keyes.
I'll see you at 11:00.
Yeah.
Goodbye, baby.
I guess I don't have to tell you... what I intended to do at 11:00, Keyes.
For the first time, I saw a way to get clear of the whole mess I was in... and of Phyllis, too, all at the same time.
Yeah, that's what I thought.
What I didn't know was that she had plans of her own.
In here, Walter.
Hello, baby.
Anybody else in the house?
Nobody. Why?
What's that music?
A radio up the street.
Just like the first time I came here, isn't it?
We were talking about automobile insurance.
Only you were thinking about murder.
I was thinking about that anklet.
And what are you thinking about now?
I'm all through thinking, baby.
I just came to say goodbye. - Goodbye?
Where are you going?
You're the one that's going, baby. Not me.
I'm getting off the trolley car right at this corner.
Suppose you stop being fancy. Let's have it, whatever it is.
All right, I'll tell you.
A friend of mine's got a funny theory.
He says when two people commit a murder, it's sort of like they're riding... on a trolley oar together.
One can't get off without the other.
They're stuck with each other and they have to go on... riding together clear to the end of the line.
And the last stop is the cemetery.
Maybe he's got something there.
You bet he has.
Two people are gonna ride to the end of the line, all right.
Only I'm not gonna be one of them.
I've got another guy to finish my ride for me.
Just who are you talking about?
An acquaintance of yours.
A Mr. Zachetti.
Come on, baby, I just got into this thing... because I happen to know a little something about insurance, didn't I?
I was a sucker.
I'd have been brushed off just as soon as you got your hands on the money.
Nobody wanted to brush you off.
Save it. I'm telling this.
It's been you and that Zachetti guy all along, hasn't it?
That's not true.
Doesn't make any difference if it's true or not.
The point is, Keyes believes Zachetti is the one he's been looking for.
He'll have him in that gas chamber before he knows what's happened to him.
What's happening to me all this time?
Don't be silly, baby.
What do you think is gonna happen to you?
You helped him do the murder, didn't you?
That's what Keyes thinks.
And what's good enough for Keyes is good enough for me.
Maybe it's not good enough for me, Walter. Maybe I don't go for the idea.
Maybe I'd rather talk.
Sometimes people are where they can't talk.
Under six feet of dirt, maybe.
And if it was you, they'd charge that up to Zachetti, too, wouldn't they?
Sure they would, and that's just what's gonna happen, baby.
'Cause he's coming here tonight, in about 15 minutes. With the cops right behind him.
It's all taken care of.
That would make everything lovely for you, wouldn't it?
Right.
And it's got to be done before that suit of yours comes to trial... and Lola gets a chance to sound off... before they trip you up on the stand, and you start to go in drag me down with you.
Maybe I had Zachetti here so they won't get a chance to trip me up... so we can get the money and be together.
That's cute. Say it again.
He came here first to ask where Lola was.
I made him come back. I was working on him.
He's a crazy sort of guy, quick-tempered.
I kept hammering into him that she was with another man... so he'd go into one of his jealous rages, and then I'd tell him where she was.
And you know what he would've done to her, don't you, Walter?
Yeah, and for once I believe you, because it's just rotten enough.
We're both rotten.
Only you're a little more rotten.
You got me to take care of your husband for you... and then you got Zachetti to take care of Lola, maybe take care of me, too.
Then somebody else would have come along to take care of Zachetti for you.
That's the way you operate, isn't it, baby?
Suppose it is.
Is what you've got cooked up for tonight any better?
I don't like that music anymore.
Mind if I close the window?
You can do better than that, can't you, baby? Better try it again.
Maybe if I came a little closer?
How's this?
Think you can do it now?
Why didn't you shoot again, baby?
Don't tell me it's because you've been in love with me all this time.
No, I never loved you, Walter, not you or anybody else.
I'm rotten to the heart. I used you, just as you said.
That's all you ever meant to me... until a minute ago... when I couldn't fire that second shot.
I never thought that could happen to me.
Sorry, baby. I'm not buying.
I'm not asking you to buy. Just hold me close.
Goodbye, baby.
Zach em.
Come here.
I said, come here.
My name is Neff.
Yeah, and I still don't like it.
What do you want?
Look, kid. I want to give you a present.
This nice new nickel.
What's the gag?
Suppose you go on back down the hill... to the drugstore and make a phone call.
Keep your nickel and buy yourself an ice-cream cone.
The number is Granite-0-3-8-6. Ask for Miss Dietrichson. First name is Lola.
She isn't worth a nickel.
If I ever talk to her, it's not going to be over any telephone.
Tough, aren't you? Here, take the nickel and call her. She wants you to.
She doesn't want any part of me.
I know who told you that.
It's not true.
Lola's in love with you. She always has been.
Don't ask me why. I couldn't even guess.
Here. Granite-0-3-8-6. Now go on and call her.
Go on. That way.
It's almost 4:30 now, Keyes. It's cold.
I wonder if she's still lying alone up there in that house.
Or if they've found her by now.
I wonder a lot of things. They don't matter anymore.
Except I want you to do a favor for me, Keyes.
I want you to be the one to tell Lola, kind of gently, before it breaks wide open.
And I want you to take care of her and that guy Zachetti... so he doesn't get pushed around too much.
Hello, Keyes.
Up pretty early, aren't you?
I always wondered what time you got down to the office.
Or did that little man of yours pull you out of bed?
The janitor did.
Seems you leaked a little blood on the way in here. Yeah.
Wouldn't be surprised.
I wanted to straighten you out on that Dietrichson case.
So I gather.
How long have you been standing there?
Long enough.
Kind of a crazy story with a crazy twist to it.
One you didn't quite figure out.
You can't figure them all, Walter.
That's right. I guess you can't at that.
Now I suppose I get the big speech... the one with all the two-dollar words in it.
Let's have it, Keyes.
Walter, you're all washed up.
Thanks, Keyes. That was short anyway.
I'm gonna call for a doctor.
What for?
So they can patch me up?
So they can nurse me along till I get back on my feet?
So I can walk into that gas chamber up at San Quentin on my own power?
Is that it, Keyes?
Something like that.
I've got a different idea.
Yeah?
Look, Keyes.
Suppose you went back to bed and didn't find these cylinders... till tomorrow morning, when the office opens...
After that you can play it any way you like.
Would you do that much for me, Keyes?
Give me one good reason.
I need four hours to get where I'm going.
You're not going anywhere, Walter. - You bet I am.
I'm going across the border.
You haven't got a chance, Walter.
Good enough to try for.
You'll never make the border.
That's what you think. Just watch me.
You'll never even make the elevator.
So long, Keyes.
Hello... send an ambulance to the Pacific Building on Olive Street.
Yeah.
It's a police job.
How you doing, Walter?
Fine.
Only somebody moved the elevator a couple of miles away.
They're on the way.
You know why you couldn't figure this one, Keyes?
I'll tell you. Because the guy you were looking for was too close.
He was right across the desk from you.
Closer than that, Walter.
I love you, too.
Stand back.
No, Paula.
Don't look back. You've got to forget everything that's happened here. That's why you're going to Italy, to Signor Guardi.
He was the best friend your aunt ever had, and he'll be yours, too.
Perhaps Signor Guardi will make you into a great singer, as she was.
Wouldn't you like that?
You must think of the future, dear, not the past.
No. Now, look.
Wait a moment, signorina. There's no use.
Paula, you are not concentrating. Your mind's not on your singing.
All these years you've worked so hard. Now what's come over you?
This opera is tragedy, signorina. You seem incapable of understanding.
Did you never hear your aunt sing Lucia?
You look like her.
But I don't sing like her.
I know.
Signor Guardi, may I speak to you seriously?
Very seriously.
Maestro.
It is 10 minutes to the hour. If you're not continuing the lesson, I'd like to be excused.
Very well, Signor Anton.
Thank you. Good afternoon, signorina.
Now, what is it you wish to say to me seriously?
Very seriously."
Signor Guardi, I've tried.
I've worked hard, but it's no use. - I haven't the voice, have I?
The trouble is not in your voice alone. Your heart is not in your singing anymore.
Each time you come here now, you look happier and you sing worse.
Tell me, Paula, you're in love?
It's something that has never happened to me before... something I never expected would happen... but suddenly it is as if nothing else existed... even my music, which used to mean so much to me.
Yes, you are right. My thoughts were wandering while singing just now.
I'm too happy. That's why you said... the tragedy was something I could never understand.
It was cruel of me to say that... cruel and untrue.
Real tragedy has touched your life... and very deeply.
But now there is a chance to forget tragedy, my child. Take it.
Free yourself from the past... and forget your singing, too, for a while.
Happiness is better than art.
Dear Maestro, no one has ever been as kind to me as you have since she died.
Will you let me meet the man who is taking my pupil away from me?
Yes, of course.
You have a rendezvous with him.
The moment your lesson is over, you fly to him.
Is he jealous of your music, these hours you spend away from him?
Dear Maestro...
I don't know when we'll meet again.
Thank you.
Did you tell him?
He told me. He didn't know who.
What did he say?
He said I should take my happiness.
And will you? Now?
Why do you still hesitate, Paula?
But I don't know you. I don't know anything about you.
Nor I about you, but I want to marry you. - Are you afraid?
I think I am, a little.
Of me?
No. No, never, but of happiness. I haven't had a lot, and I feel I can't trust it.
You must give me time to get used to the idea.
You shall have all the time you want. I've waited for you so long.
Waited? We've only known each other two weeks.
I've waited all my life till now.
I can wait a little longer. But it will not be easy to wait, to be patient, seeing you every day.
No, it won't be easy for me, either. - I should go away.
Go away?
By myself for a week, only a week... just to know what I'm doing, just to be sure.
Where will you go?
I thought perhaps to the Lakes. - And when will you go?
I thought tomorrow.
Tomorrow?
Is that too soon?
No, the sooner you go, the sooner you will come back.
But while you're away, never forget for one moment I'm here waiting... and in love with you.
My dearest.
Oh, my goodness!
It's so exciting.
Your book? Yes. It's about a girl who marries a man, and what do you think?
He's got six wives buried in the cellar. - That seems a lot.
Yes, and I'm only on Page 200, so I'm sure there's still more to come. - It's a wonderful book.
It sounds a little gruesome.
Yes. I'm afraid I enjoy a good murder now and then. My brother always calls me "Bloodthirsty Bessie."
Have a biscuit, dear.
Thank you.
Digestive biscuits. Unpleasant name, isn't it? I always call them "diggy biscuits."
I never travel without them.
You're not English, are you? - No. I was brought up there.
My aunt lived in London.
Are you on your way there now? - No.
I'm going to Lake Como.
All by yourself?
Yes, all by myself.
But is that wise?
I don't think any harm will come to me.
I'm going to London. I must be in London for the spring.
The crocuses, you know, and the daffodils and the tulips. The gardens are so beautiful in the spring.
I say "good morning" to my flowers in Thornton Square every day.
Thornton Square?
Yes. That's where I live, Number 16.
I know Thornton Square.
Do you know anyone living there?
Not anymore. - I wonder who that could be.
I know almost everyone who lives there now.
We're all so very friendly, popping in and out of each other's houses. - What number did your friends live at?
I'm afraid I don't remember.
You know, we had a real, live murder there.
Yes, I'd heard of it.
Unfortunately, it's before I went to live there, just a year before.
Ten years ago, at Number 9, a famous singer called Alice Alquist.
Have another biscuit, dear.
No, thank you. It was a most mysterious case. They never found out who killed her.
They never even found a motive. I've tried to get in the house many a time. I think it's so exciting.
Don't you? I mean, just to see.
It's just as it used to be. Nothing's been changed... - all the furniture and everything...
I think we're getting into Como.
So we are.
Is anyone meeting you?
No. - You will be careful, won't you?
I will.
Goodbye. Goodbye. Come and see me if you're ever in London.
My name is Thwaites, Miss Thwaites. I'll point out the window of the room in Number 9 where it happened. You can see it from my drawing room.
You're not angry with me?
Angry? If you hadn't come, I should have sent for you.
Come and look at the morning.
Aren't you cold like this?
What were you dreaming of?
Our life together.
And how do you see it?
I saw all the places where we'll be together. Lovely places like this.
I was thinking of our life together, too, only I heard it in music. - Something that I want to write.
Yes, what?
The whole thing is alive with happiness. I want a feeling of the early morning.
This morning.
Yes. With the sun rising, lighting your hair as it is now.
I don't know how it ends. Perhaps it never ends until I do.
When will you start on it?
Some day... after we've had our honeymoon... and settled down in a home of our own somewhere.
Where?
Where would you like us to settle?
I haven't thought. Paris, perhaps.
Paris?
Or Rome?
How would you feel about London?
London?
Paula, if you won't laugh at me, I'd like to tell you something.
I won't laugh at you. What is it?
It's an idea, a silly idea that's been with me for years.
I was in London once in the winter. It seemed there was no city in the world... that was colder to the homeless... or that could be warmer to the ones who had a home.
How I used to long for a home of my own... in one of those quiet houses in the little London squares... with the woman I should one day come to love.
Could we settle down in London? Not in a house in a square, perhaps...
Paula, why do you look like that?
Because there is a house in a square.
What house?
9, Thornton Square. - She left it to me.
She? You mean Alice Alquist?
She was my mother's sister. My mother died when I was born.
I don't know anything about her or my father. I lived with my aunt always as if I were her own.
After it happened I never went back.
That house comes into my dreams sometimes... a house of horror.
It's strange. I haven't dreamed of it since I've known you.
I haven't been afraid since I've known you.
Afraid?
Yes. For years I've been afraid of something nameless... ever since she died.
You've cast out fear for me.
If it were true, it would make me very happy.
It is true. I've found peace in loving you.
I could even face that house with you.
No, Paula, beloved. - I would not ask that of you.
Yes, you shall have your dream. You shall have your house in a square.
Good morning, daffodils. Good morning, tulips.
Percy! There it is, dear.
What are you doing, my good man?
Turning on the water in Number 9, ma'am.
Nine? Why nine?
Orders, ma'am.
It must be going to be occupied at last, after all these years.
Wouldn't care to live in there, myself.
I don't know about living there, but I would like to get a peep inside.
Good morning.
Good morning.
Are we late? - Not at all.
I've only been here a moment.
Good morning, Mr. Anton.
It's you.
Don't you remember me?
In the train in Italy last month. Diggy biscuits.
Yes, of course, I do.
Don't tell me you're coming to live in Number 9?
Yes.
We mustn't keep Mr. Mufflin waiting.
Sorry, I must go now. Perhaps we can...
I'll call directly you're settled. That's my house over there, with the pink curtains.
Goodbye, for the present. Goodbye.
I'm so glad we are to be neighbors.
So am I.
This lock needs oiling.
If there's anything further I can do, let me hear from you. Good day.
Good day.
Good day, Mr. Anton.
Now, Paula...
This is the dining room?
Yes. There's a little study beyond it.
And the drawing room is upstairs?
Yes.
Come, Paula. Don't stand there in the doorway.
Will you light the gas, please?
Gregory.
It's a very handsome room.
Yes, but to see it like this...
I remember parties in this room when it was full of flowers and light.
Those must have been wonderful days.
It's all dead in here.
The whole place seems to smell of death.
There. It will all be fresh again in a moment.
That's where she kept her treasures. Things she collected on her tours around the world.
The glass is broken.
It was broken that night.
All the things were disarranged, but there was nothing missing.
I know all these by heart.
It was a great treat when she'd unlock them... and take them out and tell me all their stories.
Careful, dearest. - She wore this glove in Romeo and juliet... at the command performance at Covent Garden.
Gounod signed it for her afterwards.
I never knew what happened to the other glove. I used to ask her sometimes... but she'd only laugh and say she'd given it away.
A very great admirer.
She would never tell me who.
I wish I could have seen her.
Let me show her to you.
That's as the Empress Theodora.
That was her greatest role.
When she sang it in St. Petersburg... the Czar used to come to every performance.
She was very beautiful, very much like you.
It was there that I found her, there in front of the fire... under her own portrait.
I was in bed, and something woke me. I've never known what.
I came running down the stairs... frightened, as if I knew what had happened.
She had been strangled.
She had been strangled. Her lovely face was all...
No, I can't stay here.
Then how would it be if we took away all these things that remind you so of her?
The painting, all this furniture. Shut it away so you can't even see it?
Suppose we make it a new house with new things, beautiful things... for a new, beautiful life for us.
Yes, and then later, we'll have people here and parties again.
Don't you want to?
Later, yes, but not just at once.
Let us have our honeymoon here by ourselves for a little longer.
Yes.
I only... - I know.
Later.
Now, where should we put all these things?
There is an attic under the roof.
All her trunks are up there and all her costumes.
Then we'll put all these there, too, and then we'll board it up... so you'll never have to see it again, never even think of it.
That piano traveled with her everywhere in the great days.
It will need tuning terribly.
Look, here's some of her music.
Her score of Theodora, just as she left it.
We'll send those upstairs with all the rest.
No, not her music. Perhaps later I might like to study again. I'd like to have her scores to study from.
What makes you play that?
Why not? That was her great song. She always used it in her concerts for her last encore.
It was everybody's favorite.
Here's an old letter.
Dear Miss Alquist, I beg of you to see me just once more.
I have followed you to London."
It was written two days before she was murdered.
Where did you find that?
In this score. She must have left it there. It was written by somebody called Sergis Bauer.
Give it to me!
Gregory, what is it?
I'm sorry...
I didn't mean to be so violent. It's just that...
Why does this letter upset you so?
It's not the letter. It's just that I am upset for you.
All these things are reminding you of her.
You said that you had lost your fears, and now everything you touch here... brings them back.
While you are afraid of anything, there cannot be any happiness for us.
You must forget her.
No, not her. Only what happened to her.
Elizabeth!
I say!
Elizabeth!
Good afternoon, Elizabeth.
It's you, miss. - Good afternoon.
Good afternoon.
The house is looking very nice now.
What's that, miss?
I said, the house looks very nice now... - from the outside.
Yes, miss.
I expect you're glad you got rid of the workmen at last.
Yes, miss. Do you think that Mr. And Mrs. Anton will be ready to receive callers soon?
I couldn't say, miss, I'm sure. We haven't had no visitors yet.
Master says seeing people isn't good for her. She hasn't been feeling too well lately.
I'm sorry to hear that.
What's that, miss?
I said, this fine summer weather we're having ought to do her good.
Yes, miss. They're going out this afternoon. First time for some while.
Good day, miss.
Good day.
What lovely-looking strawberries. I never get big ones like that.
I think I'll just taste one for luck. Good afternoon.
If you have your bags, you can start immediately.
Thank you, sir. They're downstairs, sir.
Then everything is arranged. - Your wages will be L16 a year.
Yes, sir. I understand all right, sir.
Just one more thing... I don't want you to bother your mistress about anything, ever.
If you have any questions, just come to me.
Yes, sir. That'll suit me, sir.
Then you'll remember it.
Your predecessor did not. That's why she left.
It may seem a little unusual... but your mistress is inclined to be rather highly strung.
Elizabeth, come in. This is Elizabeth, the cook.
Hello.
You'll find that she's a little deaf.
Hello.
Elizabeth, this is our new housemaid.
I was explaining her duties to her. She'll be down in a moment.
Very good, sir. I'll see you downstairs.
She's a tartar, ain't she?
What do you mean by that?
You know, strict-like.
I'm not gonna sleep in the same room with her. You see the way she looked at me?
Don't you think perhaps your costume might have something to do with it?
What's the matter with it?
It's a little, shall we say, loud?
I hope you're not a flighty girl, Lucy.
My name's Nancy, sir.
I'm sorry, Nancy.
Are you?
I don't think so, sir.
I'm glad to hear that. Your mistress is very particular about everything being very correct.
Is she, sir?
Yes.
So am I.
This is our new housemaid.
How do you do?
I'm all right, ma'am.
You can go now, Nancy.
Very good, sir.
She seems a nice girl. I'm glad.
I hope I haven't kept you waiting. - I had to go back for the guidebook.
You look like a summer's day.
Because I'm happy. We're going out, and I'm going to show you London.
Do you know what day today is?
Yes.
Three months ago today... we came out of that little church by the lake, man and wife.
I have a present for you, Paula.
Where did you find anything so beautiful?
It belonged to my mother, and before that to her mother... and now it belongs to you.
I shall wear it always. Always, my dear.
How sweet of you to give me this.
I'm afraid the pin is not very strong. - No.
I'll have it mended. You better not wear it until I have. You might lose it.
You know, you are inclined to lose things.
I am?
I didn't realize that.
Just little things. I'll put it in your bag for safekeeping.
There.
Now, you'll remember where it is.
Don't be silly.
Of course I'll remember.
That's London.
It's music.
Good afternoon.
Good afternoon, ma'am.
It's nice to see you getting out again.
Where to, ma'am? - The Tower of London.
Very good, ma'am. The Tower of London it is.
What's the matter with the mistress?
She don't look ill to me.
Is she? I don't know. Not as I can see.
Here, ladies and gentlemen, we have the ax of the headsman... and the execution block.
These are the originals with which such historic persons as Lady Jane Grey... and Queen Catherine Howard was beheaded within these precincts.
The victim, kneeling, laid his head upon the block... fitted his neck into the small, hollowed-out space... designed to receive it, whereupon the ax descended... severing the head from the torso with one blow... or in unlucky cases, two.
Moving to our right, we have a model of the famous rack... the instrument of torture upon which prisoners were stretched... their limbs being frequently torn from their sockets... in an effort to extract a confession from them, true or false.
There you are. I wondered what had become of you.
It was so close in there. Let's go out into the sunshine.
Are we going to see the torture chamber?
Uncle Brian, what's the matter?
You look as if you've seen a ghost.
That's exactly what I thought I'd seen.
There's no such thing as a ghost.
I know. I meant I just thought I saw someone I know is dead.
I have no idea who he is.
He seemed to know me and... Do you usually bow to people you don't know?
No. I supposed I'd met him somewhere.
Are you telling me the truth?
Of course.
Why should I lie?
I don't know who he is. - Yet you smiled at him.
Why? I tell you, I wasn't thinking.
I don't know why I did it. Like the other things.
What other things?
Nothing. Only I've been noticing, Paula, that...
you've been forgetful lately.
Forgetful? Losing things and...
Don't look so worried, Paula. It's nothing.
You get tired and... - Yes, that's probably what it is. I get tired.
Can't we go home? - No, we still have the crown jewels to see.
They're in that building over there. - How do you know?
What did you say?
How do you know where they are? You haven't been here before.
The guide told us inside.
Are you becoming suspicious as well as absent-minded, Paula?
No, of course not, Gregory.
The Kohinoor or "Mountain of Light." It's the most famous diamond in the world.
The imperial state crown...
That's that one. - Yes, I know. "...was made for the coronation of Queen Victoria.
Among the jewels it contains are the ruby of the Black Prince...
the size of a hen's egg, the Stuart sapphire... "which was among the jewels... "James II took with him when he fled to France...
and the diamonds and pearls from the earrings of Queen Elizabeth."
Jewels are wonderful things. They have a life of their own.
Gregory, can't we go home now?
Of course, my dear. I'll take you home.
That's the mistress's room. That's the master's.
We've got all this to see to. Have you got the sheets there?
I could have sworn that there were more than that, but...
What's up there?
Never mind about up there. - The whole floor's been boarded off.
Why?
That's the way the master wanted it.
You were right. There is nothing more beautiful than London in sunshine.
I'm sorry I spoiled the day by bringing you home so soon.
You should lie down and rest for a little, Paula.
Should I stay with you and not go out this evening?
No. You go and work as usual.
Can you really work in that room you rented?
I wish you'd let me see it and make it attractive.
I never notice my surroundings when I'm working.
You might give me your broach so I can have it repaired.
What's the matter?
I can't find it.
What?
I missed it when we were in the Tower.
I must turn everything out.
I know it was here. I can't understand it.
I couldn't have lost it.
It must be here.
I'm sure it's there.
It's not.
Paula, didn't I tell you? How did you come to lose it?
I must have pulled it out with something, I suppose. - I'm terribly sorry. Please forgive me.
Forgive, my dear? It's not as serious as that. It's not valuable.
Your present to me, your mother's broach.
I don't remember opening my bag. I suppose I must have. You did put it in there?
Don't you even remember that?
Yes, of course I do.
But suddenly, I am beginning not to trust my memory at all.
I tell you, you're just tired, that's all. It doesn't mean anything. I'm sure it doesn't.
Don't worry so, Paula. Don't worry.
Nancy, has the master left?
Yes, ma'am. A little while ago.
Please see that he has plenty of coal on the fire in his room.
You already told me that, ma'am.
Nancy, did you turn the gas up in there?
Turn it up?
No, why?
I thought it went down in here, as if you had.
I never touched it.
But this went down.
Perhaps Elizabeth lit another jet in the kitchen.
Couldn't have been her. She's been in bed for an hour. I could hear her snoring.
That's odd.
Good night, Nancy.
Good night, ma'am.
Yes, that's it.
I beg your pardon?
I said, "That's it." That's the Alquist house.
It happened in the drawing room, upstairs. That window.
I live just across the square. My name is Thwaites, Miss Thwaites.
How do you do?
How do you do? Perhaps you could tell me, has the house been occupied long?
About four or five months now.
Come along.
You don't happen to know who's living in the house, do you?
Yes. A foreign couple. Anton's the name.
What do you mean, mysterious?
Never have visitors... never go out anywhere. At least, she doesn't.
I think you're wrong.
There aren't as many as usual here today. Come along, pigeons. Come along, sparrows.
What did you say?
You seem to be wrong about her not going out.
How very surprising.
It's you, ma'am. I never knew you'd gone out.
I went for a walk, but it looks as if it might rain...
so I thought I should have my umbrella.
Suppose the master comes back and asks where you've gone?
Tell him I just went for a walk.
By yourself, ma'am?
Of course. Why not?
Suppose the master asks where?
Tell him I just...
Now do you see what I mean?
Goes out, goes back, goes in. Odd. Definitely odd.
It's an odd household, too. That maidservant, most impertinent. I can't get a thing out of her.
She won't talk to me... though she would quick enough if I wore trousers.
The way she carries on with that policeman on the beat. It's scandalous!
There, that's all there is.
Fly away, pigeons. More tomorrow.
Well!
Paper! Thank you, sir. There you are, sir.
Extra. Special. Special edition.
Here you are, governor. Paper?
Put that file back where you got it.
I tell you, the case is dead. I'm not going to have it all dug up again for nothing.
Do you understand?
You had no right to go through that file. - Budge had no right to let you get at it.
Sorry, General.
Mr. Cameron is your assistant...
Then it's his job to assist me... not go digging into 10-year-old cases on wild suspicions of his own.
Now then, Budge, you get along.
Very good, General.
What's your interest in this case, anyway?
It was rather a famous case... and it impressed me very much at the time. Besides...
I once met Alice Alquist. I was taken to hear her... at a command performance when I was 12 years old... and afterwards to meet her in the artists' room.
It sounds silly, but I still think she was the most beautiful woman...
And now...
You've seen someone who looks like her.
Living in the same house.
Why shouldn't she? If she's the niece, the house probably belongs to her.
And if you're trying to meet a pretty woman... you've no right to use official business as an excuse.
It's not that, sir. But I tell you, sir, I have a feeling there's something peculiar going on there.
Perhaps even more than peculiar.
Look here, Brian, once and for all, the case was given up as hopeless.
As for the matter of the jewels, that was dropped by order... of a most important personage.
Jewels?
There's nothing here about jewels.
There were some jewels.
They were given to her... by somebody very highly placed.
Some of the crown jewels of his... - Of another country, as a matter of fact.
What happened to them?
They disappeared.
That's why she was murdered.
That was the official theory. Though what the murderer wanted the jewels for I can't imagine.
They were too famous for him to be able to sell them.
Have they never shown up since?
Not as far as I know.
Well then, where are they?
I don't know. The murder part of the case was pursued to the utmost... as you can see for yourself from that file.
There was never any case against anyone.
There were the usual blind-alley suspects. You've read all their names there in that stuff.
And there was never anything to prove against any of them. Now run along, there's a good fellow.
Very well, sir.
Good day, sir.
Afternoon, Mr. Cameron. - Williams.
Did you want me, sir?
Tell me, you're not a married man, are you?
No, sir.
Where are you on duty now?
Down in the East End, sir.
How would you like a more fashionable locality?
I'd like it very much, sir.
We'll see what can be done about it. Don't say anything to anybody for the moment.
If you want coal on the fire, Paula, why don't you ring for the maid?
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake you. Go back to sleep, dear.
No, Paula. Now that you have wakened me, we might as well be comfortable.
Ring for the maid.
I can put it on myself.
We've had this subject out before.
Please, pull the bell cord.
It seems so unnecessary.
What do you suppose the servants are for?
Answer me. What do you suppose the servants are for?
To do things. To serve us, I suppose.
Exactly.
It's only that I think we should consider them a little.
Don't be cross with me.
I'm not cross with you.
There are a lot of things...
Did you ring, sir?
No. Your mistress rang.
Go on. Why don't you tell Nancy what you rang for?
A little coal on the fire, please, Nancy.
Very good, madam.
You're looking very pretty this afternoon, do you know that?
I don't know it at all, sir, I'm sure.
Tonight is your night out, isn't it?
That's right, sir. Whom are you meeting tonight?
You might light the gas, too, Nancy.
I see they've changed the policeman on the beat.
Is his heart going to be added to the list of those you've broken?
I didn't know I'd broken any, sir.
I'm sure that's not true.
And that complexion of yours... that's something that's not quite true, either.
In fact, I was wondering whether you might not care... to pass some of your secrets on to your mistress... and help her get rid of her pallor.
Sure. I'd be very pleased to do anything I can, sir.
Will that be all you're wanting?
Yes, except tea when it's ready.
Very good, sir.
How can you talk to Nancy like that?
You seem so anxious to regard the servants as your equals.
I thought I would treat her as one. Besides, I was only trifling with her.
No wonder that girl despises me, the way you encourage her.
Despises you?
Whatever makes you think that?
Her whole manner!
The way she talks to me, the way she looks at me.
Looks at you?
I hope you're not starting to imagine things again.
You're not, are you, Paula?
Of course I'm not.
I hope you're not, but if you start talking about the way Nancy looks at you...
Don't turn away, Paula. We must have this out.
Do you really think Nancy despises you?
Answer me, Paula.
No, Gregory.
I'm glad of that. It hurts me when you're ill and fanciful.
Come in.
What is it now?
If you please, sir, Miss Thwaites is downstairs. She wanted to know if the mistress was at home.
You mean that old busybody from across the square?
Yes, sir. She has her nephew with her.
I don't think we need bore ourselves with them. - Tell her your mistress is not at home.
Gregory, really, she's been...
My dear, if you let her in once, you'll always have her here.
But she's called so often, and we've never been at home to her...
I do not want people all over this house!
Bringing her family with her.
You tell Miss Thwaites... that your mistress is sorry, but she's not well enough to see her.
Very good, sir.
Gregory, why did you do that?
I would've liked to have seen her.
I thought you were only trying to be polite. Why didn't you tell me you really wanted to see her?
I couldn't in front of that girl.
You must get over this ridiculous fear of the servants.
If you really wanted to see her, all you had to say was: "Show her up, Nancy," wasn't it?
Yes, but...
I'm sorry, miss. That's all I know. The mistress isn't well enough to receive anyone.
Please tell her how sorry we are.
Come along, Auntie dear.
You wouldn't have had time to see them anyway. You have to dress, do your hair.
Why?
We're going out tonight.
We are?
You didn't tell me. Or have I forgotten?
Don't you think this is charming?
It's from the new operetta at the Gaiety. I wish I could write tunes like Strauss.
Paula, you silly child, don't look like that. Of course you haven't forgotten anything.
This is my surprise for you. We're going to the theater tonight.
How wonderful!
And you thought I was being cruel to you.
No, you're not cruel.
Keeping people away from you, making you a prisoner.
You're the kindest man in the world. I'm sorry.
I'm so happy.
What's the matter?
Paula, I don't want to upset you. If you will put things right... when I'm not looking, we'll assume it did not happen.
But what?
Gregory, what?
Please don't turn your back on me. What has happened?
You mean you don't know?
No, I...
Look.
Yes.
The little picture has been taken down.
Who took it down?
Why has it been taken down?
Why indeed?
Why was it taken down before?
Get it from wherever you've hidden it and put it back in its place.
But I haven't hidden it. I swear I haven't. Why should I?
Don't look at me like that.
Someone else must have done it.
No, don't ring. Please don't ring. - Don't shame me before the servants.
Please stop being hysterical.
Now sit down and calm yourself before they come.
We must get to the bottom of this once and for all.
Please come in, Elizabeth.
Do you notice anything missing from this room?
Missing, sir? No.
I don't think so, sir.
Look carefully on the walls.
There's a little picture missing, sir.
Exactly.
Did you take it away?
No, sir. Have you ever taken it down from where it belongs?
No, sir. Why ever should I?
Why indeed?
You go to church, don't you?
To what, sir?
Church!
Yes, sir.
Please kiss this Bible as a solemn oath that you've told the truth.
Thank you, Elizabeth. You may go now. And send Nancy in here at once.
Nancy. - Yes, sir.
Gregory, no, not that girl.
I'll say anything. I'll say that I did it.
I'll not have that... Please!
Have the goodness to control yourself. This is painful enough without your making it worse.
Please come back.
Since you've thrown suspicion on the servants... they must be cleared of it. Now sit down.
Did you hear what I said?
Sit down.
Come here, Nancy.
A picture has been taken down from the wall there.
So it has. That's another rum go.
I did not ask for any comments on your part. I want to know whether it was you who took the picture down.
Of course it wasn't, sir. What would I want to take it down for?
Shall I ask her to kiss the Bible, Paula, or will you accept her word?
Of course I'll accept it.
Let her go. - Very well. You may go, Nancy.
Give me that Bible!
There. Do you see? I swear on the Bible I didn't take that picture down.
Go look for that picture.
So you knew where it was all the time.
I didn't know.
I only looked there because that's where it was found twice before.
I didn't know, Gregory. I didn't.
I think you better go to your room.
We're not going to the theater?
I'm afraid you are far from well enough for the theater. Now come.
Lf it was I who took that picture down... - lf?
If it was I who took it down the other times... if I do all these senseless, meaningless things...
It's so meaningless. Why should I take a picture down?
Then I don't know what I do anymore.
I know, Paula. - That's just the trouble.
But then, if that's true... then you must be gentle with me.
You must bear with me, please.
Please, Gregory, please.
Now come, Paula.
You better go to your room.
What are you going to do?
I'm going out to work and forget all this. No.
Please don't leave me here all by myself now.
I get so frightened when I am here alone and you go out night after night.
Frightened?
You never told me that before.
I'm telling you now! I'm frightened of the house!
I hear noises and footsteps.
I imagine things, that there are people over the house.
I'm frightened of myself, too.
Gregory, please! Please don't leave me. Stay with me.
Please. Take me in your arms, Gregory.
I hope to find you better in the morning.
She seems to be getting worse, doesn't she, sir?
You will please not refer to your mistress as "she."
Thank you, Nancy.
Gonna work on your tunes again tonight, sir?
You're always working, aren't you?
Yes. What are you doing with your evening out?
I'm going to a music hall.
I've never been to an English music hall.
You don't know what you've missed, sir.
You'd like it a lot, sir.
We must see about that.
And whom are you going to the music hall with?
Gentleman friend, sir.
Now, you know, Nancy, don't you... that gentleman friends are sometimes inclined...
to take liberties with young ladies? - No, sir, not with me. I can take care of myself when I want to.
It strikes me that you're not at all the kind of girl that your mistress... - should have for a housemaid.
No, sir?
She's not the only one in the house, is she?
Let people find their own places for the concert. Just sit where they like.
Those who don't care for music can go into the smoking room.
May I come in?
Brian.
Good evening.
Good evening, Lady Dalroy. How are you, sir?
How are you, my boy?
Nice to see you. - Am I the first to arrive?
I have a favor to ask. Are you having a sit-down supper afterwards?
Yes, and I've put you next to Laura Pritchard.
I don't like Laura Pritchard. She's got adenoids.
Nonsense. She's a most agreeable girl, and I want you to be very nice to her.
Haven't you learned yet that Mildred is an incurable matchmaker?
I'll be nice to Miss Pritchard another time. Tonight I want you to be very kind and put me next to Mrs. Anton.
Will you? - It's most tiresome of you. All right.
Who's Mrs. Anton?
She's the niece of Alice Alquist.
She used to come here as a child. Brian told me she was back in London now and married... so I invited them to come tonight.
Who's Mr. Anton, by the way?
What does he do? Where does he come from?
Put me next to her tonight, and I'll find out for you.
I'm sorry, Brian, but you'll have to sit next to the Pritchard girl after all.
The Antons can't come.
No. - Letter from her?
No.
From him. - Him? - Yes.
Apparently she's ill. Very tiresome of her. Read it if you want to.
I must go and order the tables.
Is that you, Paula?
Yes.
Why are you dressed up like that?
Because tonight is Lady Dalroy's reception.
But I sent a note.
I know.
I sent a note to say you were not well enough.
I'm quite well enough, and I want to go.
Lady Dalroy was very kind to me when I was small... and I am going.
I must get out of this house, meet people... and see a little of what's going on in the world.
I am going to this reception, Gregory.
Then I'm afraid you'll have to go alone.
Then I must go alone.
I didn't realize this party meant so much to you.
I'll go and change immediately.
You didn't really think I would let you go alone, did you?
I don't know.
I shan't be a minute.
Come in.
Did you ring for something, ma'am?
Yes. Please fetch a cab.
But I thought you were...
Get a cab, Nancy.
Is the master going out, too? - Yes, he is.
Please hurry.
Very good, ma'am.
Cabby!
Beckoning a cab on your evening out?
Yes. I'm going out to dinner at Buckingham Palace, I am. - I'm gonna have a lovely evening out.
What's the matter with you?
First they're going out, then they're not.
Changing all my plans. Never a word to me from him.
You better get along. They'll be out in a minute.
See you Sunday?
Perhaps.
Usual place?
Usual place.
Good night.
Good night.
Draw your cloak around you. It's damp. Dalroy House.
Good night, Nancy. - Have a nice evening, sir.
You're Paula Anton. I'm sure you don't remember me.
I do indeed, Lady Dalroy. It was at the children's party here, and there was a magician.
May I introduce my husband, Lady Dalroy.
How do you do?
I hope you will forgive all the confusion... but my wife suddenly felt much better, and we were so anxious to come.
But of course.
You'll find some seats over there. Seratsky hasn't played yet. I'll see you later at supper.
What are you looking at?
Nothing. I thought I saw someone I knew, that's all.
My watch is gone.
I didn't put it there. I swear I didn't put...
Would you be quiet, please?
Paula, please control yourself.
Being seen like this in public.
Come.
I'm very sorry, but I'm afraid my wife's illness has returned.
Can I send for a doctor?
No. If I can just get her home.
We shouldn't have come tonight, but she was so anxious. I'm so sorry, Lady Dalroy.
I think it's the most...
I've tried so hard to keep it within these walls, in my own house.
Now, because you would go out tonight, the whole of London knows it.
If I could only get inside that brain of yours... and understand what makes you do these crazy, twisted things.
Are you trying to tell me I'm insane?
That's what I'm trying not to tell myself.
But that's what you think, isn't it?
That's what you've been hinting and suggesting for months, ever since...
Since what? - Since the day I lost your broach.
Yes, that's when it all began.
No, it began before that.
The first day here, when I found that letter.
The one I found among the music... from that man called Bauer. - What letter?
Sergis Bauer. Yes, I remember.
Yes, you're right. That's when it began.
I can see you still, standing there and saying:
Look at this letter," and staring at nothing.
What? - You had nothing in your hand.
What?
I was staggered, but I didn't know then... how much reason I had to be.
I don't know. What reason?
I didn't know then about your mother.
What about my mother?
Your mother was mad.
She died in an asylum when you were a year old.
That's not true.
I've been making inquiries about Alice Alquist's sister. I've talked to the doctor who attended her.
Would you like to see him?
No. He described her symptoms to me. Would you like to hear them?
It began with her imagining things, that she heard noises, footsteps, voices... and then the voices began to speak to her.
In the end, she died in an asylum with no brain at all. No!
Please stop.
Now perhaps you will understand a lot of things about yourself and me.
Now perhaps you will understand why I cannot let you meet people.
He must have been rather disappointed that you left before he could talk to you.
Who?
The man who was sitting behind us.
Where?
Tonight.
You only went because you knew he would be there.
What, Gregory? Who?
The man who bowed to you that day at the Tower.
Who is he, someone from the past?
Someone you refused, perhaps?
I never met him. I have no idea who he is.
Who is he?
Why is he dogging my footsteps?
I don't know that he is.
You lie.
Why do you lie to me?
I never lie to you.
I'm sorry. I should not have said that.
I know you never lie to me. I believe you.
You're not lying. It's worse than lying. You've forgotten.
You've forgotten him as you forget everything.
But perhaps I'm wrong to try to handle this myself.
The case is one for people who know about those things.
We shall have visitors, and shortly.
A doctor? - Two.
I believe two is the required number.
Yes?
It's you, Constable.
Good evening, sir.
Nasty night to be out, isn't it?
Very nasty, sir, indeed.
Where'd he go?
He didn't get past me as I came through the alley.
He certainly turned in here.
You must have missed him in the fog. I'd have heard his footsteps as he passed, Mr. Cameron.
He must've gone into the rear of one of these houses.
Yes, but which?
Do you think he could have gone into his own house?
Lf he did, sir, that's not against the law.
No, but it's against common sense.
Why should he walk out of his own house and all the way around the corner... just to get back to where he started from?
But the service entrance to Number 9 is out front. There's no way into Number 9 from back here.
Then where did he go?
Number 5 is empty. But what would he want to go into an empty house for?
I don't know, Williams.
Just coming, ma'am.
What is it, ma'am?
I want you to help me.
I'm so tired. - Yes, ma'am.
Did you turn on the gas?
Did you turn on the gas anywhere downstairs just now?
Why, no, ma'am. I've had it on in the kitchen all evening, that's all.
I thought it went down in there, as if someone... had turned it on in some other part of the house.
There's no one in the house but me, ma'am. Nancy's not back yet.
But the gas comes in pipes, ma'am.
And I expect they get more gas in the pipes at some times... than they does at others.
Yes, I suppose that could explain it.
Do you hear anything?
Hear anything, ma'am?
Yes. Up there. Listen.
Listen to what, ma'am?
Those sounds. Those noises up there.
But there are sounds. Sounds like someone moving about.
Elizabeth, listen, please. - There are no noises up there, ma'am. How could there be?
The whole floor is boarded up. You know that as well as I do.
No one can't get in up there. You know, ma'am, you just imagine things.
And into the mews.
Williams, come in.
You're early. Get another cup, will you?
Sit down.
Make yourself comfortable.
I don't know what it means, but this morning around 3:00...
I was standing on the corner of Thornton Square, looking both ways-like... and suddenly, who should I see turning up, but our friend again.
Coming out of the mews, it looked like.
Yes? I got a good look at him under the lamppost. I tell you, that man had been up to something.
What?
I wouldn't undertake to say what exactly... but he was kind of in a mess.
Clothes untidy, tie all on one side. Dirt and dust all over, even on his face.
Had he been in a fight?
He didn't look like that, sir.
More as though he'd been digging in a cellar or something.
Have some coffee.
Thank you, sir. I've had my breakfast already. Had it in the kitchen at Number 9, as a matter of fact.
Nancy tell you anything this morning?
If you ask me, Nancy's getting ideas above her station.
Seems the master told her... that her mistress might be going away for quite a long time... and that he wanted her to stay and look after him.
The master told her her mistress might be going away?
That's right, sir.
A long time, you said?
Yes, sir. What do you think that means?
From all you've told me these last weeks, I should say it could mean... any one of a number of quite unpleasant things.
I've to get into that house tonight.
Not while he's there. - He goes out every evening?
Right, sir.
Tonight after dinner.
Nancy says he's told her not to let her mistress see anyone.
Then you'll have to see to it that Nancy isn't home tonight.
Any little thing I can do for the Yard, sir.
I thought you wouldn't mind.
There's just one thing more though. How do you know the lady herself will see you?
I don't know.
Yes. I think there's a way.
People who go every night to places of public amusement... "can hardly enter into..."
Your mother was mad.
People who go every night to places of public amusement... "can hardly enter into the fresh gala feeling... "with which an opera or a concert..."
She died in an asylum with no brain at all.
The snug comfort of the close carriage... "...the pleasure of setting out with companions...
I'm sorry, sir, but the mistress won't see anyone.
Did she tell you to say that?
You're Elizabeth, aren't you?
How'd you know my name?
I know many things about this house. You're fond of her, aren't you?
You'd like to help her, wouldn't you? This is your chance because I'm a friend, and you're going to let me see her.
No. I don't dare, sir. I'd lose me place.
My husband isn't here.
I know that, Mrs. Anton.
It's you I want to see.
Go away. I'm ill. I can't see anyone.
Elizabeth, stop him. I didn't ask him to come.
Mrs. Anton, my name is Brian Cameron.
You mustn't come here.
Go away. Not until I've given you this.
Look at it, please. Alice Alquist gave it to me years ago at Covent Garden.
I was a little boy overcome with admiration.
Now you'll trust me, won't you?
She gave it to you.
After all these years... the great admirer she used to make such a mystery of.
Tell me something, Mrs. Anton. Are you planning on going away somewhere?
Go away? Why, no. I have nowhere to go.
Unless my husband sends me away.
Is that why you came here?
To take me away? Are you as frightened as all that?
I'm sorry. I haven't talked to anyone for a long time.
I can't talk to you, either. I'm not... I'm afraid I...
You're afraid you're going out of your mind.
I'm here to prove to you that you're not.
To help me do that, you've got to answer my questions. Tell me now... where is your husband now?
Where has he gone?
He has taken a studio where he can work on his composing.
He can't work in this house. He has to have it quiet.
Tell me, is there anyone else in the house now except us and Elizabeth?
No. Why?
The gas just went down.
You saw that, too?
Then it really happens.
I thought I imagined it. That only means that someone else has turned it on.
I thought that, too, but every night, I've been all over the house... and there's never been another light turned on.
At last I can tell this to someone. Every night when my husband goes out...
The light goes down?
Yes. - And then what?
Then I think I hear things.
I watch and wait. - Later on, the gas goes up again.
And he comes back.
Yes. Quite soon after. Always quite soon after.
You say you think you hear things. What things?
Sounds. Noises over my room.
What's up there?
A whole floor of trunks and furniture.
Is that what you meant?
Yes!
But who?
Mrs. Anton, you know, don't you?
You know who's up there. - No.
Are you sure you don't?
No.
How could he be?
There's an alley behind these houses. He goes in the back of Number 5, that's the empty one... and then across the roof.
Why?
You said there's old furniture up there.
My aunt's. And her clothes, stage costumes, trunks, all of her things.
All of her things?
And they said the case was dead.
Tell me, has he any weapons in the house?
He has a revolver. Why shouldn't he?
Do you know where he keeps it?
I think he has it in his desk in there.
You can't open his desk. No. You have no right to.
Whoever you are, you have no right to! He'll know. He'll think that I...
What should I say to him? You won't have to say anything.
Perhaps it's a good thing I came tonight.
There was a letter.
And it was from Sergis Bauer.
What was that?
What was that name you said? - Sergis Bauer. I found this, but my husband said I dreamed, and now it's here.
Bauer.
It's been here the whole time.
There was a Sergis Bauer connected with Alice Alquist.
He was a young pianist who played for her in Prague. Let me see that.
Dear Miss Alquist, I beg of you to see me once more. "I followed you to London."
Look.
Dear Lady Dalroy..." This is my husband's writing.
So is this. Your husband and Sergis Bauer are one and the same person.
This letter from him to Alice Alquist was written two days before her murder.
He said there was no letter, that I was going out of my mind!
No. You're slowly and systematically being driven out of your mind.
Why?
Perhaps because you found this letter and know too much.
Or because then he would have control of your property, of this house... and could search in the open instead of the dark like this.
Search? What is there to search for?
For the things for which Alice Alquist was murdered: Her jewels.
I have her jewels.
They're the jewels you didn't know she had.
Famous jewels.
Jewels for which he was searching that night... when he was frightened away by hearing someone come down the stairs.
Someone he never saw. A little girl.
Me.
So he was here that night, but he never...
He never knew her.
You're wrong. You're making a mistake.
I know him. He's my husband.
I've lived in the same house with him. You're talking about the man I'm married to.
Mrs. Anton, there's not a detail of the Alquist case that I don't know... and unless I'm more mistaken than I've ever been in my life... the man called Sergis Bauer has a wife living in Prague now.
So you see, he must have planned the whole thing... step by step from that night.
If that were true, then from the beginning, there would have been nothing.
Nothing real from the beginning.
I'm sorry to take everything away from you like this.
No. - But you must believe me. Your life depends on what you're going to do now.
Don't you see the way everything fits in?
The gas.
How long has it been up?
Elizabeth, whatever happens tonight, have her welfare in mind.
You can count on me, sir. But what am I going to say to the master when he comes back?
He won't come back anymore, Elizabeth.
What are you doing?
I was lying down.
Fully dressed?
Did you hear what I said?
Yes.
Then why don't you answer?
I don't know.
You don't know?
Do you know anything about anything you do?
I will be obliged if you will come with me to my room.
Sit down in this chair.
You know what you remind me of as you walk across the room? Have you ever seen anyone walking in their sleep?
But you're not asleep. No, you can't deceive me.
You're fully awake, or you would not have broken open my desk!
Now be careful how you answer. Why did you open my desk?
I didn't open your desk.
Nancy?
Nancy's out.
Who, then? Elizabeth?
No, it wasn't Elizabeth.
Please don't question me anymore.
Let me go back... No. Stay there, Paula.
Why did you open my desk? - I didn't open your desk.
Why did you open my desk?
I didn't open your desk. It was he...
He opened it.
What are you talking about?
Who is he?
A man. A man who came to see me.
When?
While you were out.
Who let him in?
Yes, sir?
Who was the man who came to see your mistress while I was out?
What man, sir?
Come, Elizabeth. You must have answered the bell.
No one was here, sir, while you were out.
But, Elizabeth... But you saw him.
You opened the door for him yourself.
Elizabeth, say it!
No, ma'am. I didn't see anyone at all.
But he was here. I know it.
I know it. But he was here. I know it!
I saw him. You see how it is, Elizabeth?
Yes, sir.
I see just how it is.
I couldn't have dreamed it. No, I couldn't have dreamed it.
Did I dream?
Did I really dream?
Yes, Paula, you dreamed it. You dreamed all day long.
Are you telling me that I've dreamed...
Everything.
All that happened?
All that did not happen.
Then it's true. - My mind is going.
Haven't I told you?
It was a dream.
Like all the rest. - Take me away.
I can't fight it anymore.
I will. It was a dream.
Take me away.
Was I any part of this curious dream of yours, Mrs. Anton?
You.
Perhaps my presence here might help you to recall it.
Who the devil are you?
Apparently a mere figment of your wife's imagination.
Through the skylight, like you... and down these stairs. - How did you get into this house?
You made it very easy.
Will you tell me what you're doing here?
Mrs. Anton, I think you'd better go to bed. You must be tired.
You'd better explain your business, sir.
As a mere figment, as a mere ghost existing in your wife's mind... I could hardly be said to have any business.
Paula, go to your room, please.
So you found them after all.
I was right about you. I knew from the moment I saw you that you were dangerous to me.
I knew from the first moment I saw you that you were dangerous to her.
I should have followed my instinct about you, as you followed yours.
I thought she was Alice Alquist come back to life.
I didn't know then that she was walking with Sergis Bauer.
I'm afraid I don't know your name.
Cameron. Want my address, too?
No. I think I can guess it.
So we both ended our search tonight.
This is where Alice Alquist hid them.
Where the world could see them, yet no one would know where they were... except the man who gave them to her, watching from the royal box.
Pretty clever of her to put four priceless jewels among a lot of paste and tape.
For the last time, what do you want?
The jewels, and justice.
How does it feel, Bauer, to have planned and killed and tortured for something... - and then to know it's been for nothing?
For nothing?
What is it, ma'am?
I thought I heard a shot.
Help!
Mr. Williams, come quick!
Up there!
Anybody at home?
Well, Mrs. Anton, you believe me now.
Perhaps you'd like to see these things.
They cost a woman's life.
I want to speak to my husband.
Mrs. Anton, I don't think that's advisable.
I want to speak to him alone.
I'm afraid that's impossible.
I assure you, I'm quite helpless.
I'll be waiting on the stairs.
Go and see if he's listening.
He is not listening.
You have got confidence in him.
Did he tell you a lot of things about me?
Yes. - They were lies.
Why should he lie to me?
Because he's in love with you. I can tell. I feel it.
Do you? Do you really, Gregory?
Or shall I call you Sergis?
So he told you that, too. What of it? Have you never heard of an artist taking a stage name?
Sergis Bauer's mine. It was a part of my life I didn't care to tell you about.
I was a failure then. - They don't hang a man for that, do they?
No, they don't hang a man for that.
You remember our first days.
You remember Italy? There have been times when I thought I only dreamed those days.
Come closer, Paula.
Closer.
Look into my eyes.
If I ever meant anything to you, and I believe I did... then help me, Paula. Give me another chance.
Look, in the drawer of that cupboard there is a knife. Get it and cut me free.
Be quick, Paula. Get me the knife. Cut me free.
Would you get it, Paula?
Would you get it for me?
Yes, I'll get it. I'll get it for you.
Hurry, Paula.
There's no knife here.
Yes. I put it there.
I don't see any knife.
I put it there tonight.
No, it isn't here.
Are you suggesting that this is a knife I hold in my hand?
Have you gone mad, my husband?
Or is it I who am mad? Yes, of course.
That's it. I am mad.
I'm always losing things and hiding things. I can never find them. I don't know where I put them.
That was a knife, wasn't it? And I have lost it.
I must look for it, mustn't I? If I don't find it, you will put me in the madhouse.
Where could it be, now?
Perhaps it's behind this picture.
Yes, it must be here.
No. Where shall I look now?
Perhaps I put it over here. Yes, I must have done that.
My broach. The broach I lost at the Tower.
I found it at last! You see? But it doesn't help you, does it?
And I'm trying to help you to escape, aren't I? - How can a madwoman help you escape?
But you're not mad.
Yes, I am mad, as my mother was!
No, Paula. That wasn't true!
Help me.
If I were not mad, I could have helped you. Whatever you had done, I could have pitied and protected you.
But because I am mad, I hate you. Because I am mad, I have betrayed you, and because I am mad...
I am rejoicing in my heart without a shred of pity... without a shred of regret, watching you go with glory in my heart!
Mr. Cameron, come.
Come, Mr. Cameron. Take this man away!
Take this man away!
You ready?
Quite ready.
I don't ask you to understand me. Between us all the time were those jewels, like a fire.
A fire in my brain that separated us...
Those jewels which I wanted all my life.
I don't know why.
The cab is coming, Mr. Cameron.
Goodbye, Paula.
Goodbye, Gregory.
This night will be a long night.
But it will end. It's starting to clear.
In the morning, when the sun rises... sometimes it's hard to believe there ever was a night.
You'll find that, too.
Let me come and see you and talk to you. Perhaps I can help somehow.
You're very kind.
Well!
But, Father Fitzgibbon, why do you want a new furnace?
Because, Mr. Haines, last winter, in the month of November alone... four of me parishioners took to the bed with pneumonia.
That's too bad.
It's only by a miracle that I meself pulled through.
It'll only cost $632.50... complete with an automatic damper.
But, Father, I didn't come here to put in new furnaces.
I think you ought to give him his furnace, Dad.
It would warm people's hearts, and maybe his collections would be bigger.
No, Son. Improvements are out.
Now, Father...
That was good. What he said, that was good.
Well, he's new to our business. Now, Father...
No furnace? No furnace.
Now, Father, here's my business.
You owe the Knickerbocker Savings and Loan Company... five payments on this mortgage.
If they're not taken care of...
I'm afraid the Knickerbocker Savings and Loan Company... will have to take the necessary action.
Why don't you make it the subject of your sermon next Sunday?
Tell it to your people. "The Lord loveth a cheerful giver."
Oh, I can imagine meself saying that in Mass next Sunday.
What a sermon that would be, Mr. Haines.
The text of me sermon this morning...
is taken from the mortgage... "according to Mr. Haines...
from the 1st to the 23rd clause."
Very dull, you know.
But that's your business. Keep it bright.
But seriously, Father, we've made a bad loan... and we want our money back.
Well, you'll get it somehow.
That's all I wanted to know.
Good day, Father. Come on, Son.
Dad.
You can't foreclose. Why, it just isn't being done.
I read up on it.
There's never been a Catholic church foreclosure... in the history of New York.
There's always a first time, isn't there?
Don't you think you're being a little harsh with him?
You've got to be. Son, never loan money to a church.
As soon as you start to close in on them, everybody thinks you're a heel.
Well, aren't you? Yes.
Good morning.
Could you tell me where I'd find Saint Dominic's Church?
I'm looking for St. Dominic's Church.
Why?
I'm gonna work there.
The new assistant?
And you can't even find the church.
Well, all I can say, young man, you're off to a mighty bad sta.
What's your name?
Father O'Malley. Charles Francis Patrick O'Malley.
What's yours?
Her name is Quimp!
Hattie Quimp!
You'll see a lot of her, you will. At St. Dominic's, she's a regular two-a-dayer.
Very religious, burns candles.
I could tell you plenty about them, too.
And if I did, they'd have to leave the neighborhood.
If you're looking for St. Dominic's, Father, it's a block up and then to your left.
Thank you.
Hello.
Hello.
How's things going?
Terrible. They never hit one to me.
Watch right field for me a minute, will you, Father?
Sure. I got to run in the house. Okay.
Hey, fellas, the Father's gonna take my place.
Okay, Father.
I got it!
Got it!
Thanks.
What do you think you're doing?
I'm the substitute right fielder.
You ought to be ashamed of yourself... playing around with kids, smashing people's windows.
A big grown-up man.
And a priest, besides.
Hello.
Still looking for St. Dominic's.
You just wait till I tell Father Fitzgibbon.
Look, you keep out of this, will you?
Go on. This is between him and me.
Honestly, I'm sorry about the window.
Yeah, but being sorry don't fix it.
I intend to pay for it.
When?
Priests never have any money.
That window... Now wait a minute, my good man... I said I'd pay for it.
I told you I'm sorry.
What else can I say after I say I'm sorry?
That ain't the idea. It's the principle of the thing.
A priest shouldn't go around breaking people's windows.
It sets a bad example for the children.
You got me stymied there. I'm contrite and I'm penitent. I've told you I'm sorry.
You told me that twice.
But that don't...
That doesn't fix the broken window, I know.
I think you're just playing hard to get along with.
Maybe a little security might help? These were given to me.
Why don't you keep them until I've made good?
Maybe they'll make you feel better.
They're mother of pearl, you see?
If that'll satisfy you, I'll run along.
Hey, you, here, I got no use for this.
First place, I don't believe in it.
As a matter of fact, I don't believe in anything.
I can believe that. I'm an atheist. Besides, I'm superstitious.
All right, then, I'm sorry about the window. I'll have it fixed.
Can I have the ball back?
You even throw like an atheist.
Mrs. Carmody, did the young priest come yet?
He's here, but he insisted on changing his clothes before seeing you.
That's nice. Tidy himself up a bit.
Hello, Father.
I'm your new curate, Father.
If you'll excue my appearance.
No, it's not possible. The Bishop may have a grudge against me.
He may think I've a mouthful of clover and can't preach... but even the Bishop wouldn't do a thing like this to me.
I see what you mean.
Young man, may I ask... is that the official garb of the priests in St. Louis?
No, I... Something happened to me on the way over.
I guess this just isn't my day, Father. Do you mind if I...
No.
Young man, as a matter of curiosity... what made you become a priest?
Why, I...
Hello?
Well, you don't say.
You don't say.
Oh, yes, I can well believe it, yeah.
Mrs. Quimp?
Yes, indeed, Mrs. Quimp.
I appreciate your good intentions. Yes. Goodbye.
I guess she told you about me?
Yeah, the garrulous old biddy.
Young man, I'm afraid you're off to a very bad start.
That's what she said. I'm sorry, Father, I...
Smashing people's windows. Such conduct.
Oh, yes, that reminds me. I wanted to ask you something.
Listen now.
Tell me, young man, how did you happen to become a priest?
Well, I...
Yeah. Chuck?
Chuck who?
Father Chuck? That's me.
Here, I'll take it over here.
Hello?
Timmy!
Well, how are you, Timmy? I just got in.
Well, what do you know?
That's Father O'Dowd, an old friend of mine. We used to go to school together.
Hail Alma Mater Thy time-honored halls
Shall echo with our praise till we die
And 'round our hearts are the ivy-covered walls
Of East St. Louis
High
Good, Chuck. Can't you talk?
Well, no.
All right, then, I'll do the talking.
How does your new pastor impress you?
You're a big help. It's a little early to say.
Time will tell, though.
No, I think it would be better if I told you when I saw you.
Yes, it would be much better.
All right, Timmy, make it soon, huh? So long. He's a great little man.
Yeah.
What were we talking about?
Yes, I was going to ask...
You were going to ask me if I want to see the church.
Yes, that's right. Yes.
I like this. It's beautiful. Thank you.
How long you been here, Father?
Forty-five years.
And the...
Forty-six in October.
The church? Same.
I built it.
I can only hope someday I can say I built as much.
This is nice.
Yeah, the birds like it.
They're good company. Listen.
I've taken a great deal of pleasure in me garden.
It's been hard work, but it's been worth it.
I think you'll find this a very pleasant place in which to meditate.
You do meditate, don't you?
Oh, yes, sure.
Now I'll show you the church.
What we really need is a loudspeaker system.
For a minute I thought I found a four-leaf clover.
Guess it just isn't my day.
Would you like to see the church? Yes.
Mrs. Carmody, just a minute.
Just a minute.
Where's Father O'Malley?
He left early this morning.
The young man doesn't sleep as late as you do, you know.
What's this?
His luggage.
It just arrived. Golf, tennis. And where, may I ask, is his fish pole?
It's here.
Good morning, Father.
Been to market?
Mrs. Carmody could attend to that. You should have been making parish calls.
I have. Mrs. McGonigle, the one with the big house and rheumatism.
She sent you a present.
She did?
Very generous of her, I must say. A fine Christian woman, Mrs. McGonigle.
Wonder what it is. Something to eat, I dare say.
Jam. No, pickled pig's feet.
Possibly some brandied peaches.
If there's one thing I'm partial to, it's a nice big jar of brandied peaches.
A nice basket, too.
Yes. She wants it back.
They're too young. Much too young to be separated from their mother.
That's what she said. So here's the mother.
Isn't she cute?
The joy of giving is indeed a pleasure.
Especially when you get rid of something you don't want.
Mrs. McGonigle is famous for these tricks.
When her husband died, she sent me his umbrella... his long flannel underwear, and his moustache cup.
Hail Alma Mater Thy time-honored halls
Shall echo with our praise till we die
And 'round our hearts are the ivy-covered walls
Of East St. Louis High
Timmy, how are you?
Chuck, I'm glad to see you.
How long since we've seen each other?
Four years.
Five, anyway.
Has it been that long?
Pardon me.
Father Fitzgibbon, this is my old friend, Father O'Dowd.
How are you, Father Fitzgibbon?
We've been friends since we were knee-high to a niblick.
He was our local Huckleberry Finn.
Laugh and the world laughs with you," he'd say.
Cry, and you cry all by yourself.
How are you, Father?
I just dropped by to see if Father O'Malley could play a little golf this afternoon.
You did? Where's your parish?
Right over here, St. Francis.
Well, now, about your golf.
But at St. Dominic's we've very little time for games of golf and such like.
If you were working for me, all I can say is that you wouldn't have time for it, either.
It's lucky for me then that I'm at St. Francis.
It's my hope St. Francis can say the same.
He's got you there, Timmy.
Good, Father, very good.
Father, why don't you come with us?
It's a grand game.
Sure, we'll teach you. A man is never too old to learn.
Lot of fresh air on the golf course.
And profanity, too.
No, a golf course is nothing but a poolroom moved outdoors.
You mind if I use that one sometime, Father?
Young man, would you mind...
How did he ever become a priest?
Well, I don't...
Father Fitzgibbon.
Excuse me.
Who is it?
Mrs. Quimp.
Does he know?
Does he know what?
That you're in charge.
How'd you know? I didn't.
I gathered as much when I heard you were here.
Everybody knows that St. Dominic's is in a bad way.
Father Fitzgibbon is getting to be an old man.
This needs a young fellow...
Timmy, look.
Don't mention it to anybody.
No.
When I had my talk with the Bishop, it was our understanding... that Father Fitzgibbon was to remain here as pastor... and I was to try and straighten out St. Dominic's without hurting his feelings.
I see. You're in charge, but you're not.
I don't think I'd like an assignment like that.
But the Bishop couldn't very well put him out to pasture, could he?
Pasture"?
What's this I hear about a pasture?
I was just saying to him, Father... the next time I come past your church
I'm going to drop in and see you. Good day, Father. So long, Chuck.
I was going to ask you something.
Oh, yes, the telephone. Mrs. Quimp just telephoned.
Her landlord is throwing her out again.
She wants somebody to go and see her.
You better go. I'll go right along, Father.
Would you mind the puppies?
Thank you.
I'll bet you're the new assistant... the one who's going to get St. Dominic's out of all its trouble.
And I'll bet you're all the trouble.
I'll wager you're the man with the mortgage.
You've heard about the mortgage?
All churches have mortgages.
It isn't respectable for a church not to have one. My name's O'Malley.
Mine's Haines.
Nice meeting you.
We may have to touch you for a little more a little later on.
We're gonna need a new paint job here soon.
I must run along. You look like a man it'll be a pleasure to do business with.
Get out!
You're not putting me out!
I'll pay you me rent when I get it!
Good morning, Father.
Good morning.
Hello, Father. Mrs. Quimp and I were just discussing you.
You were?
As you know, I represent... the Knickerbocker Savings and Loan Company.
Inasmuch as Mrs. Quimp declines to pay her rent... the Knickerbocker Savings and Loan Company... refuses to offer her any further hospitality.
Is she very far in arrears?
Mrs. Quimp has paid us nothing for six months.
It's certainly very nice of you to show her leniency.
Supposing the poor old woman has no place to go?
The Knickerbocker Savings and Loan Company is not a charitable institution... like St. Dominic's.
With us, it's just a matter of cold-blooded business.
With you it's different. You haven't got anything and you don't want anything.
That's your business and people respect you for it.
But I'm not in your business, see?
If I haven't got anything and don't want anything, I'm a bum.
Surely there must be something we can do about it.
I don't know what you'll do about it, but I'm going to throw her right out on her ear.
Give her a break. Give her a month to make good in.
St. Dominic's will guarantee it.
St. Dominic's?
I can see you haven't been around long.
Why, St. Dominic's is in worse shape than Mrs. Quimp.
My old man happens to own the mortgage...
Your father holds the mortgage?
You're darn right he does. Confidentially, he'd like to find a way to foreclose.
He wants to tear down the church and make a parking lot of it.
Can you imagine it?
He's a very disliked man.
I'm sort of following in his footsteps.
Junior?
It's turkeys.
Let's cut through the churchyard.
Good afternoon, boys.
Hello, Father.
That's a fine fat bird you have there.
We was sort of bringing it over for you.
It's sort of a present. Ain't it, Herman?
Yeah.
That's very generous of you.
Such a fine bird and all.
Now, where may I ask did you get it?
We got...
We won it in a raffle over at the theatre.
We were lucky. Isn't that great?
But, surely, your mother...
Except on Christmas, Ma don't like turkey.
She don't?
Honest.
That's most fortunate for me. There's nothing I'm more partial to than a nice tom turkey.
Roasted, all with dressing. I appreciate your kindness, boys.
It ain't nothing, Father.
On the contrary, I appreciate the thought behind it.
Small luxuries, like small sacrifices, are ofttimes the most godly.
Bless you both. Thank you.
Take it inside the kitchen to the housekeeper.
Okay, Father, we'll see you later.
So you guaranteed Mrs. Quimp's rent?
Of course.
St. Dominic's can't afford it.
I expected you to counsel Mrs. Quimp, not to adopt her.
Hot turkey.
Hot? Of course it's hot.
That's what I say.
Bless us, O Lord, for these Thy gifts which we are about to receive. Amen."
Amen.
Say, Father, you know a youngster around here named Tony Scaponi?
What about him?
This afternoon...
Tony belongs to a fine upstanding Catholic family.
Eleven children. Sure, I know Tony.
As fine a lad as there is in the parish.
Police don't think so.
They don't?
No.
If something isn't done about Tony and his pals... they're gonna wind up in a reform school.
Who told you that?
The police.
You've been listening to Patrick McCarthy, no doubt.
Let me tell you that that man hasn't been to Mass in the last 10 years.
That may be, but I think McCarthy's right about those kids.
They're terrorising the whole neighborhood.
No use talking like that.
To hear the police talk, you'd think that every lad in the parish was a criminal.
I'll have you know that the very food there before us... is brought to us by two of those very lads the police are so maliciously slandering.
Is that so?
Tony Scaponi was one of them. I gave them both my blessing.
And they gave you the bird.
Yeah.
I'll get it.
Hello, McCarthy.
Good evening, Father.
Well, I brung them. Tony Scaponi, Herman Langerhanke.
Hi, fellows. I don't think you have to wait, McCarthy.
Okay, Father.
Say, I understand that you fellows like baseball pretty well.
Yeah.
I was thinking, Saturday... the Yanks are playing the St. Louis Browns, a doubleheader.
Would you like to go out and see the games with me?
St. Louis is my old hometown, you know. I'll get all the passes I want.
What do you say?
Well, I guess so.
Yeah, sure, I guess the fellas would like that.
It's a date then. I'll meet you here Saturday at noon?
That'd be good.
You run along and have your dinner. I'll go finish my turkey.
Let me see now, where was I?
Oh, yeah, I know. I was going to ask you something.
What made me become a priest? No.
About young Tony. What was it the police accused him of?
Stealing.
Stealing what?
Turkeys.
Seems the boys hijacked a poultry truck down the street here.
There was quite a bit of excitement. The driver reported them to the police.
Did the poor man get his turkeys back?
All but one, Father.
Thank you.
McCarthy, how are you?
Good morning, Father.
You open for business?
Always open for business, McCarthy.
Come on in.
Come on.
Come right in, Pat.
I got a problem, Father. Yeah?
Seems like it's more yours than mine.
It's her. Well, Father, it's this way.
Last night I'm walking me beat, see?
Who do you think I runs into?
Her?
Mrs. Quimp.
Officer McCarthy," she says. You know how the old stool pigeon talks.
Yes, I do.
If you'll go around the corner, you'll find a girl.
I've been watching her and she ain't up to no good."
Well, Father, I goes around the corner and there, like the Quimp says, I finds her.
Do you follow me, Father?
Yes.
Well, I looks at her and sizes her up.
One of those things, I think. I'm just about to say to her:
Look, sister, not on my beat."
When she turns, and right away I sees I'm out of line.
You follow me, Father? Yeah.
To get down to it, Father, I find she's broke and run away from home.
Doesn't know a soul in town.
So, instead of booking her, I takes her home.
It's all right with the missus for one night, but if she stays any longer...
I guess Mrs. McCarthy, good woman that she is... is no different from any other woman.
You follow me, Father?
I follow you. So, anyway, she tells us that she's run away from home... on account of her folks don't understand her.
We tried arguing with her, Father, but she's a tough one.
She thinks "Honor thy father and thy mother" is a belly laugh.
Well, Father, guess I'll let you pick it up from here.
Says her name's Carol James.
All right, McCarthy.
So long. Goodbye. All right.
You can go in now.
Come right in. Won't you sit down over here?
Carol, suppose you give us your version of it?
I guess it's just about like he said.
You don't get along with your parents? No.
So you're going to leave home?
I've left.
How are you fixed for funds?
I haven't any. That's how I met Officer McCarthy.
But I'll get by.
Why don't you go back home?
I tell you, at home my life is intolerable.
Parents?
We don't agree on anything.
Don't like the way I do my hair, my eyebrows, too much lipstick.
Too something or other, too long, too short. Do you think it's too short?
Well, I don't know.
They even object to my boyfriends.
If they do let me go out, they say,
Where are you going? Come home early.
Come right home after the show."
No drive-in."
No matter how early I get in, it's too late.
And if I say we ran out of gas, they say I'm lying.
Are you?
Sometimes.
Did you ever think of maybe having the boyfriends over to the house?
Now you talk like they do.
I can't have them over to the house because Grandma sleeps in the living room.
She does?
By 9:00 we have to be off the couch.
She needs it for a bed. Can you imagine?
Of course, you know, there might be two sides to it.
Maybe you're being a little unreasonable.
I'm 18.
Eighteen? As old as that?
When I was 18, I thought my father was pretty dumb.
After a while, when I got to be 21... I was amazed to find out how much he'd learned in three years.
Now that you're in New York, what do you propose to do?
I'm going to get a job.
I'm a singer. A singer?
You any good?
Of course I'm good.
What makes you think so? Well, I...
I'm just good, that's all.
Would you sing something for me? Maybe I can help you.
Supposed to be a pretty good judge.
You wouldn't know the kind of songs I know.
How do you know?
Do you happen to know Day After Forever?
What key?
Do you mind dropping it just a little?
¶ All day tomorrow
¶ I'll be whispering your name ¶
¶ And the day after forever
¶ I know I'll do the same
¶ Maytime or winter
¶ I won't let you out of sight ¶
¶ And the day after forever
¶ We'll talk about tonight
¶ Your laughter is a melody
¶ That I'll remember long
¶ It plays upon my heartstrings ¶
¶ It's my favorite song
¶ All through a lifetime
¶ I'll be loving you and then ¶
¶ On the day after forever
¶ I'll just begin again
What do you think?
You got a pretty nice voice, but instead of so much of this... you ought to think about putting a little feeling into the words.
For instance, Father?
¶ All day tomorrow
¶ I'll be whispering your name ¶
¶ And the day after forever
¶ I know I'll do the same
¶ Maytime or winter
¶ I won't let you out of sight ¶
¶ And the day
¶ After forever
¶ We'll talk about tonight
I see what you mean, Father.
Supposing you try it then?
Just speak the words.
Your laughter is a melody... that I'll remember long.
That's it.
It plays upon my heartstrings.
Now sing it.
¶ It's my favorite song ¶
¶ All through a lifetime
¶ I'll be loving you
And then ¶ On the day after forever
I'll just begin ¶ Again
What's that "again"?
I was imitating you, Father.
Did I do that?
Definitely.
Maybe, but I didn't do that... ¶ And the day after forever ¶
¶ You're my favorite song There's no thought behind that at all.
¶ We'll talk about
What has that got to do with the song?
Hello, Father.
This young lady came to us for some help.
So it's work you're wanting.
Yes, Father.
I think maybe I could place you.
You can?
What would you think of a little general housework?
Mrs. Scaponi, with all those children, 11, no, 12, in October.
I think maybe she could use you.
No. I'm not looking for that kind of work.
I don't think you understand, Father. She's a singer.
Aren't you?
Well, now...
And where, may I ask, are you expecting to find employment?
In some nice cool, airy nightclub, I suppose.
Any prospects?
No.
Not exactly. And you're willing to starve rather than push a broom?
You have a home, I presume?
No, she just left it, Father.
Go right back to your parents.
A fine little girl like you singing someplace like that...
Blue Goose or something.
But you've got to start someplace, Father.
Nonsense. Being a good wife and mother is a good enough start for you. Like your own mother.
Goodbye, Father.
Young lady, you go home and stay home till the right man comes around.
The right man will never come near our house.
But don't worry. I'll get by.
Carol!
Wait just a minute. Father.
Do you think you could let me have 10?
Of what?
$10. She's all alone. She hasn't a thing.
Open up our hearts. $10.
Just a minute.
How about $5? No, $10.
Carol, I didn't like the way you said, "I'll get by."
Here's something to tide you over.
But, Father...
It's all right. It's not charity. It's a loan.
Thanks. I can use it. I appreciate it.
I guess there's a lot of things I should have said to you... advice and one thing or another.
But you wouldn't have paid any attention.
After all, you are 18, aren't you?
Don't worry. I'll be all right.
Of course you will, Carol.
I'll get by.
Don't say that. Let us hear from you.
All right, Father.
Bye. Bye, Carol.
Hey, fellas.
What are we doing hanging around here for?
Yeah! 'Cause I promised O'Malley, that's what for.
Why?
'Cause I said so, see?
Hey, fellas, look.
Lace panty-coats.
Yeah, lace panty-coats.
First thing you know, he'll be charming us into these things.
Yeah, making altar boys out of us.
Hold it. First guy up, I kick his teeth in, see?
Look, you, O'Malley's a right guy, see? Pick him up.
Look, you, O'Malley's a right guy, see?
He didn't rat on us about the turkeys, did he?
No.
Took us to a baseball game? Yeah.
Bought us hot dogs, didn't he?
Yeah.
He's gonna take us to a picture show, ain't he?
How do we know?
Hello, Father.
Say hello to the Father.
Hello, Father.
Hi, fellas.
Where'd you get the outfit?
It's the St. Louis Browns.
I used to work out with them.
They thought I brought them luck. When I left, they gave it to me.
That's the outfit to wear in a cellar.
Oh, you, knocking my team. I guess you fellas wonder why I asked you down here.
Father, I want to talk to you a minute.
Wanna see me?
Just a minute. Pardon me, boys.
Tony, what's on your mind?
Well, Father, so you won't have no beef coming,
I'm laying it on the line, okay?
Okay. They're here.
Like I promised. Only, you should have heard them squawk.
Worse than that turkey.
They did?
Yeah, they figured being a priest... you were gonna slip them the old routine.
Personally, I'm for giving you a break.
What I say goes.
Swell of you, Tony.
It ain't nothing, Father. Only, the way it is now, I'm on the hook for you, see?
I'm responsible for you.
Get me? I won't let you down.
Maybe you won't, but you step out of line once... me and the gang will drop you like you were a hot potato.
Okay. Can I talk to them now? Sure, go ahead.
Boys, I'm not gonna do much talking.
Like Tony says, I'm gonna lay it right on the line.
I asked you down here to do me a favor.
St. Dominic's needs a choir, and I want to start one.
I know what you're thinking, but it's not gonna be that way at all.
It's gonna be fun. Believe me, I like fun as much as anybody.
If it doesn't turn out that way... if you think I'm trying to slip something over on you... like Tony says, you can drop me "like a hot potato."
What do you say?
You gonna give me a break?
Father, that depends.
What is it?
How many of you here know Three Blind Mice?
I know it.
One, two. Any more?
Come on, you all know it.
Everybody knows it?
Sure. Fine.
What's the matter with him?
Herman?
He's pouting. Hey, Herman!
He's got a good bass voice. You want him?
Certainly, Tony.
You've got him, Father.
Now, let's see, we got to divide this up someway.
Hey, Herman, wait a minute.
The Father wants to see you.
I don't wanna see the Father...
Keep quiet, will you, please?
Don't hit me on the head. You make me dopey!
You are dopey.
Now keep quiet. Come here.
Look, he wants a bass singer.
I ain't a bass singer!
You are a bass singer.
Why am I a bass singer?
That burns me up!
My head! He wants a bass singer.
I don't know how to sing...
Will you go down?
Now, keep quiet, okay? Let's go.
Okay.
¶ Three blind mice ¶
¶ See how they run!
¶ They all ran after the farmer's wife ¶
¶ Who cut off their tails With a carving knife ¶
¶ Did you ever see such a sight in your life As three blind mice ¶
¶ Three blind mice
¶ See how they run!
¶ They all ran after the farmer's wife ¶
¶ Who cut off their tails With a carving knife ¶
¶ Did you ever see such a sight in your life As three blind mice ¶
It's no business of mine, but sometimes... the things you do in haste are the things we most regret.
Think it over a while. Then if you really feel you must see the Bishop...
That I do.
But the boys are better off here than running the streets.
I'm sure that was Father O'Malley's idea.
I'm a tolerant man, Mrs. Carmody.
But there are some things that get under my skin... and Three Blind Mice is one of them.
But he's young, Father.
I'll admit, maybe a wee bit impulsive.
But I know he means well.
After all, it was the Bishop himself did put him here.
And the Bishop himself will put him someplace else.
I'm going to ask to have Father O'Malley transferred.
Don't worry. It's not a bad report I'll be making.
I'll just tell the Bishop that this young man and I differ.
We don't see eye to eye. I'd be happier if he were sent some other place.
It's a long, hard road you've come, Father.
Forty-five years, and most of the time carrying other people's burdens.
The time has come when you should rest on your oars.
Take things a mite easier. Enjoy your life.
Let somebody else carry the load for you.
Sure, and Father O'Malley's got a strong pair of shoulders.
¶ Three blind mice ¶
¶ See how they run!
¶ They all ran after the farmer's wife ¶
See what I mean?
No, I've got to see the Bishop.
We got our sections. I'll give each section a note.
Then we'll put them together and have a chord.
Take this section first. Here's your note.
Got that?
Let me hear it now.
I thought we had singers here.
Let's hear everybody in this section. Big, now, let me hear it.
That's good. Second section, here's your note.
You got that?
Let me hear it.
We got a cruller in there somewhere?
Who is that? You?
What's your name?
Elmer.
Elmer, your voice is changing, isn't it?
I guess so, Father.
Have to drop you down a bracket. Get here in the third section.
Elmer is a switch hitter, it seems.
Let me hear that second section again.
That's great.
Now the third section. Here's your note. Got that?
Elmer, you sing like you're made for this section.
Now we're gonna drop way down in the basement. Watch.
It's tricky. Everybody take a toehold.
That's your note. Let me hear it.
There's a pink one somewhere.
That wasn't me.
What did you sing?
Sit down, Tony. Okay.
Everybody together now. You got your notes?
We hit them all together and we got a nice chord. Ready? Everybody take a deep breath now.
Let's hear it.
You got chord number one, chord number two, chord number three.
Put those chords together and we can sing a song.
I'll hold up the fingers, they'll be your signals. Watch the signals.
Make out I'm the catcher. I'm giving you the signals.
One, two, three. Ready?
Here's your note no.
¶ Silent night
¶ Holy night
¶ All is calm
¶ All is bright
¶ Round yon Virgin ¶ Mother and Child
¶ Holy Infant ¶ So tender and mild
¶ Sleep ¶ In heavenly peace
¶ Sleep ¶ In heavenly peace
That's fine, boys. Thanks very much.
Want to call it a day? There's still enough light outside for some baseball.
Let's sing some more. Yeah, let's go ahead.
Yeah, come on!
Let's sing some more.
You saw the Bishop, Father? Yeah.
Would you ask Father O'Malley if he'd mind stepping into me study?
You wanted to see me, Father?
Yes, so I did.
Sit down.
Father O'Malley, I've been to see the Bishop.
Oh, you have?
And I want to be frank with you.
I must admit that my purpose in going to see the Bishop... was to have you transferred.
I'm sorry you don't like me, Father.
I don't dislike anyone.
It's just that I disagree with you.
What did the Bishop say?
After a little talk, he congratulated me... on me 45 years at St. Dominic's.
He has a remarkable memory.
He said it was a monument... to the fact that I had built it.
Coming from the Bishop, that's certainly a fine compliment.
Then I told him I had come to talk about you.
That seemed to disturb him.
Then he started telling me about what a fine young man you are.
Capable, progressive, how much confidence he had in you.
He even told me that... he had a nice talk with you before you reported to me.
Of course, he didn't tell me what you two talked about.
He didn't have to.
I could see it in the good man's eyes.
When you get to my age, you can do that, you know.
Oh, yes. Then, after a little more telling me how progressive you were.
he asked me why I'd come.
And knowing what was on his mind and to save him the embarrassment... of having to tell me...
Oh, to be sure... the Bishop wouldn't hurt anyone.
I put him at his ease.
Bishop," I said... "the very thing that's on your mind is on mine.
It's the very thing I've come to see you about.
I want you to put young Father O'Malley...
in charge of St. Dominic's."
The Bishop seemed much relieved.
He congratulated me on my ability to see... so clearly at my age... on my ability to face the inevitable.
Then what happened?
That was all.
Father, why can't we go along just as we have been?
You're in charge now.
Sit down.
No, Father.
Sit down. I'll familiarize you with...
There's no hurry about it.
We can do that anytime, Father.
Is there anything you'd like me to do? I mean, now.
Nothing.
Well, then... if you don't mind, I'll lie down a while before dinner.
All right, Father.
When you and the Bishop had your little talk... it was more or less along those lines, wasn't it?
Yes.
I think you better start without him.
Looks like he's not coming down for dinner.
He said he wanted to take a little nap.
He didn't look well, did he, when he came in this evening?
Go see if he's awake. If he's coming down, I'll wait for him.
Father O'Malley!
Father O'Malley! Father!
He's gone.
He's packed his things, everything. He's gone.
Where would he go? I can't imagine.
Okay, sure, but keep at it, will you? No, you can't miss him.
A little guy. Old.
Got a grip and an umbrella. Okay.
Nothing yet, Father. They're gonna check the subways, the hospitals.
Look, Father, take it easy, will you?
You better go home. No use the two of us getting drowned.
Call me the minute you hear anything.
I don't care what time it is.
I will.
Shall I make some coffee? No, thank you.
Come on. Now what's the matter?
If you don't mind it, I'd rather go in by myself.
If you don't mind, I found you and I'll deliver you personally.
That's not necessary.
There's no reward, you know.
It's going to be a little difficult... and I'd rather explain to Father O'Malley in me own way.
And I can do that better when you're not around.
Okay.
But if you want my advice... you just tell him you've been a bad boy, you ran away from home and you're sorry.
And if you want my advice, you'll go to church on Sunday... and say you haven't been to Mass in 10 years and that you're sorry.
Hello.
If you don't mind, I've come back, but only temporarily.
Until me plans are more formulated... maybe you wouldn't mind letting me stay.
I'll be no bother to you.
Let's get out of these wet clothes and get you up to bed. Here, Father.
But I don't expect me old room.
That's yours now. I haven't moved in there yet.
I insist.
That's your room. I'll sleep on a cot anywhere.
I'll not even be bothering you for me food.
I'll eat out. We'll talk later. Mrs. Carmody will bring you something.
No. I'm not a bit hungry.
I'll... Come on now, Father, just a wee snack.
I've been keeping it for you on the stove.
Nice juicy cut of roast beef, Yorkshire pudding... and there were some creamed onions, too.
And some asparagus with buttered breadcrumbs.
And golden brown potatoes and a nice cup of coffee.
Well, if you insist... just a small portion of everything.
I hope it wasn't too much trouble for you, Mrs. Carmody.
No trouble at all, Father.
I feel I ought to help with the dishes.
Don't worry about the dishes.
It isn't much washing they'll be needing.
You're still a little cold, Father.
You were drenched to the skin. You ought to take a little something to warm you up.
Do you have a wee drop of the "crature" about?
Matter of fact, I might have a little one with you.
I was out myself tonight. I went out for a paper.
Well, in that case...
I'll ask Mrs. Carmody where she keeps it. No.
Look yonder in the bookcase.
No, the other side. Now down.
You'll find it behind The Life of General Grant.
A bit of old Ireland?
Yes.
Every Christmas since I left, my old mother sends me one of these.
With a degree of abstinence, it becomes me calendar.
I get a little behind during Lent, but it comes out even at Christmas.
That's me mother.
She's very beautiful.
Of course that was taken some time ago. She's 90 now.
Let's drink to your mother. Hope you'll be seeing her soon, Father.
What about your mother?
I don't remember much about her.
She died when I was quite young.
Let's drink to the two of them, anyway.
Thank you, Father.
You know, Father O'Malley...
I always planned that as soon as I got a few dollars ahead...
I'd go back to the old country and see my mother.
Now, would you believe it, that was 45 years ago... and every time I get a few dollars ahead...
There's always somebody that seems to need it more than you do.
You'd like her. She'd like you, too.
She always had a song in her heart.
I can almost hear her now.
Me boy, do you know Too Ra Loo Ra Loo?
¶ Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ral ¶
¶ Too-ra-loo-ra-li
¶ Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ral
¶ Hush now, don't you cry
¶ Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ral
¶ Too-ra-loo-ra-li
¶ Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ral
¶ That's an Irish lullaby
¶ Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ral
Good night.
Take it easy, boys. Here, Tony, here's the fare.
Everybody right home and to bed.
Get a lot of rest. I'm responsible for you. Don't forget we got a rehearsal in the morning.
Aren't you coming with us?
No, I think I'll walk home.
I want to think about my sermon for Sunday.
It'll be extra special for your parents.
Oh, good.
On how to bring up children.
Father!
Good luck to you!
Chuck.
Jenny!
Chuck, it's good to see you.
It's good to see you, too.
Where were you going, Jenny?
To work, and I'm late. Come along.
Gangway.
What are you doing here?
This is the Metropolitan.
This is where I work.
Wait a minute. Isn't that Carmen?
What do you play, one of the spectators at the bullfight?
Believe it or not, I'm Carmen.
Jenny Tuffle, Carmen?
I've changed that. It's Genevieve Linden.
I was singing Carmen in Rio and they heard me and said:
Would you sing it here?" Here.
Can you imagine?
Jenny Tuffle at the Metropolitan.
Imagine that.
Well, Chuck, make yourself comfortable.
I have to be getting on with it.
It's good to see you, Chuck.
Come on, Effie, I'm terribly late.
I don't know why I'm even talking to you.
No?
Why didn't you write?
I did write.
I know you did, but why did you stop?
Didn't I tell you?
No, you didn't, but you're going to.
Jenny? Please, I want to ask you just a small favor.
Hello, Tommy.
What is it? Tonight, would you be so good as to glance occasionally at my baton?
Tonight, let's not race.
Let's try just for once to finish together?
All right, Tommy, I promise.
And, Tommy, do me a favor.
Meet Chuck O'Malle. He's a very old friend of mine.
Chuck, Signor Tommaso Bozanni.
Father. "Chuck"?
She always calls me that.
You haven't told me yet, Chuck. Why did you stop writing?
I did tell you in my last letter.
Which letter was that?
I guess that must have been the letter you didn't get.
You wrote to me in Rome, in Florence...
Naples, Vienna, Budapest.
Then I went to Switzerland, and I found your letter waiting for me in Lucerne.
You should have been there, Chuck.
It was a week before Christms and there was a quaint little post offic.
I walked up to it in the snow.
The moon was so bright that I read your letter on the way home.
And I answered it that night.
But that letter in Lucerne was the last one I got.
From there I went to South America.
But there were no more letters.
What happened, Chuck?
Chuck, what...
Father Chuck.
It'll take me a little while to get used to that.
Where's your parish, Father?
I'm over here at St. Dominic's, about 10 blocks from here.
You remember Timmy?
Tim O'Dowd?
Yes, of course, I do.
He's at St. Francis now. He's a priest, too.
Dear old Timmy.
Can you imagine that?
Well, I'll have to be running along.
Please don't go. Tommy, he can stand in the wings, can't he?
It would be a privilege. Please.
You know, Tommy...
Father O'Malley was the first one to tell me I could sing.
Maybe one day I'll tell her the same thing.
If she listens to you, maybe you could persuade her... to listen just once to me.
Watch the baton.
Good luck, Miss Tuffle.
You wanted to see me, Father?
Yeah.
Mrs. Quimp here, good woman that she is... has come here with a bit of disturbing information.
I think it should more properly be brought to your attention.
Nice work, Mrs. Quimp.
What is it? Suppose you tell Father O'Malley in your own words.
You'd better tell him, Father.
Your little songbird who was without funds... but not a bit interested in general housework... is feathering her nest in her own manner.
And if Mrs. Quimp's observations are correct, a very fine manner it is.
It seems, Father O'Malley, that the young lady in question... has an apartment directly across the street.
Opposite Mrs. Quimp's bedroom.
According to Mrs. Quimp, young Ted Haines comes early and stays so late that...
Mrs. Quimp is losing a lot of sleep.
It's queer, isn't it, Father?
Young Haines was ready to throw me out without so much as a "How do you do?"
But when it comes to this young lady... and mark you, there are other words I could call her... he acts quite different.
Don't you think it's strange?
That's a question. People do funny things, you know.
Fine goings-on, Father O'Malley. It's as plain as the nose on your face.
The nose on whose face, Father?
It doesn't matter whose face it's on.
You and I have got to face it. Excuse us.
This is very serious business, Father O'Malley.
As you're more familiar with the case, I think you should handle it.
I'll handle the little sins.
¶ All through a lifetime ¶
¶ I'll be loving you and then ¶ ¶ On the day after forever
¶ I'll just begin
¶ Again Come in.
Hello, Father.
Hello, Carol.
Hi, Father. Hello.
I heard you. That's more like it.
Thank you, Father.
Maybe it's because I'm putting more meaning into the words.
Very nice here, isn't it?
Very nice.
Before you go any further...
You mean it's all in my mind?
That's right.
Yes, I'm sure Father is just dying to hear more of the details.
Yes. Won't you sit down?
I was going down the street, minding my own business, too... when who do you think just happened by, purely by accident, of course... and pulled up alongside of the curb?
Ted Haines, Jr.
Right. And what do you think his approach was?
You tell him.
I prefer not to remember.
Well, being a woman, I do.
His exact words were, "Hey, good-looking, what's cooking?"
Now wait a minute.
What I really said was, "Who do you know that I know?"
You know, that's worse.
Well, that was that.
And with practically no more of a build up than that, he asked me to lunch.
Who knows? It might have worked. It's been known to.
So after I'd cooled him off, I came back here.
No job, no money, expecting to be thrown out any minute.
There was a knock on the door. I said to myself, "The landlord.
And who do you think was there? Junior?
Right.
I was so surprised.
So was I.
Well, up to here, we're all surprised.
Naturally, before throwing me out, he had to know a little about me.
So in a few well-chosen sentences, I gave him the details.
Sort of like I told you.
And you found a landlord with a heart of gold.
Well, not exactly a heart of gold, Father, but...
Well, we had the apartment vacant, and it seemed a shame to throw her out.
Anyway, what's wrong with that?
Nothing that I know of, up to here.
As I was saying, it was a shame to throw her out.
Like Mrs. Quimp?
Yeah. No!
Well, that's different.
I can see that, obviously.
She told me about coming to see you and that you wanted to help her.
You don't have a corner on helping people, do you?
And besides, I've practically got her lined up in a job.
Yes, and as soon as I get it, I'm going to pay him back.
Every nickel of it. You, too, Father.
No hurry about me.
Rather a nice-looking piano you have here.
Well, she needs one, doesn't she?
She's got to practice. She's a singer.
It was very thoughtful.
Of course, pianos are a little expensive these days.
I asked her first if she couldn't play a ukulele.
Well, then naturally... Yeah, naturally.
Carol tells me you can play, Father.
How about trying it out to see if I got a good buy?
Yes, play something for us, Father.
Would you mind us asking you a few questions, Father?
No.
Where'd you get that wicked left hand?
Well, I've always been interested in music.
Used to write a bit of it at school. I had a little band.
We used to play for the school dances.
O'Malley's Orioles.
You know, at one time I had quite a decision to make:
whether to write the nation's songs or go my way.
Any regrets, Father?
Regrets? No.
I get a great happiness out of helping people realize that... religion doesn't have to be this.
Taking all the fun out of everything.
It can be bright.
Bring you closer to happiness. Do you go to church, Ted?
Or would you rather I change the subject?
If I could just express musically what I have in my mind... it would be much more eloquent.
It would sound simpler, and you'd remember it.
Sometimes the spoken word can be pretty dull.
You mean, sing your sermons, Father?
Yeah, sort of.
Have you had anything published? No.
Will you play us one of your unpublished ones?

Goodbye, Carol. Goodbye, Ted. Bye, Father.
Nice thought. Going My Way.
Isn't it?
He's quite a fellow.
Good morning, Father.
I'd like to present Miss Genevieve Linden.
Jenny, this is Father Fitzgibbon. Good morning, Father.
How do you do?
She's a singer.
Looking for work?
No, Father. She sings at the Metropolitan Opera House.
Well, it's a great privilege to meet you, Miss Linden.
You've come quite a ways in the world.
Traveled extensively? Yes, quite a bit.
Where's your home?
I just bought a home in Long Island.
A nice home?
Very lovely.
In that case, you'd be interested in a crazy quilt. We're raffling it off.
Again?
We're trying to raise a little money, Father O'Dowd.
I see.
How many?
I'll take them all. How much are they?
Be $10.
Thank you, and I hope you win it.
Thank you.
And I hope you win it, too, Jenny. Then perhaps you'll donate it to our church.
And we can raffle it off over there all over again.
I'd hate to see that crazy quilt leaving the parish.
Where's the pied piper and his merry men? Down in the basement.
Thank you, Father.
Goodbye, Father.
Goodbye. Thank you.
Congratulations on selling all your tickets.
Like some more?
You're our first audience, you know.
Ready, boys?
That's the best.
Of course, we have our more serious side.
Would you like to hear something nice, something with more beauty?
Yes, very much.
Very well done, boys. That's all.
Thank you so much.
See you all tomorrow.
They're angels.
They've got something you lose when you get older.
What's the matter, Timmy?
Nothing.
That was beautiful, Chuck. Beautiful.
Of course, we don't get Genevieve Linden of the Metropolitan every day.
Nor Deems O'Dowd either.
Now wait a minute.
I'm glad to see you've kept up your interest in music, Father.
Are you writing anything anymore?
Yes.
I have a little song here that Timmy's going to take to a publisher. A very good friend of his.
If he likes it, that might be the answer to all our troubles.
I have bad news. I've been to the publisher. He wasn't interested.
Wouldn't even look at it. Said they were loaded up.
May I see it?
So you're still in trouble.
Wouldn't even look at it?
He glanced at it.
What'd he have to say?
Schmaltz isn't selling this season."
What are they buying?
Barfola."
No, I think they call it "Voffala."
Yeah, Voffala. Boy, I heard some of their song hits.
It Was Hut-Sut Time On The Rilla-Rye.
And then there was another one. I couldn't understand the words.
This fella lost his girl in Salt Lake City.
Then he goes on to say the altitude is 5,400 feet.
The average temperature, 73.
The section is noted for gold, silver, copper, grain.
But that doesn't make any difference to this fella... because he's lost his sugar.
Voffala.
Well, I know what Voffala is. It's...
What's the matter with that?
Not from me.
Can you imagine Beat Me Eight To The Br by Daddy O'Malley?
I like this.
She's buying schmaltz.
Going My Way.
Will you autograph it for me? All right.
Thank you.
I have to go now. Father Tim, can I drop you off?
You can, thank you.
There you are.
Thank you. Thank you.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
My pen, Father.
Yes.
Good day.
Good day.
Yes?
Well, who are you?
I want to have a talk with you. That's who I am.
You must be his father.
How old are you?
I'm 18.
Well, that's good.
Ted!
Be right with you, darling.
What?
Hello, Dad.
Where have you been for the past two weeks?
Well, Dad...
I've been in a blue heaven dancing on a pink cloud.
She came in on a moonbeam.
That's a lie. I had you followed.
That wasn't cricket.
When you were my age, I didn't follow you around.
Everything I say kills her.
It kills me, too. Do you realize this is one of my apartments?
Yes. I had it redecorated.
And that's one of my robes.
Yes, I had it altered.
I'm going to like him.
Do you know I could have you thrown out of town?
Maybe I know something about her you don't know.
She was picked up on the street by the police.
I know that.
Maybe we know something that you don't know. We're married.
Married?
I'll have that annulled.
You can only get them annulled when they aren't right in the first place. Ours was right.
We said something about, "Till death do us part." Remember?
Where were you married?
St. Dominic's, Father O'Malley.
O'Malley!
A secret marriage?
Well, he's put his foot in it this time.
It wasn't a secret marriage. It was in all the papers.
I didn't see it.
You never get past the financial column.
Don't be impertinent!
Young woman, do you know how he's planned to support you?
You know he's quit his job?
That's all right. I'll support him.
Sure, she's working.
You'd live off your wife?
Mother was a big help to you, wasn't she, until you got on your feet?
That was entirely different. I made something of myself.
Yes, Dad, you certainly have.
Look, Son.
My boy.
Have you no family pride?
No shame?
Nope.
You've certainly slipped, my boy. You've lost everything.
I don't think so, Dad. I think I've found something.
Well, darling, I guess I'd better get dressed.
I think I'm a failure as a father.
I don't think so.
Darling, where's my hat?
I'll get it.
You'll have to forgive the way we've been acting today, Dad.
We were a little hysterical.
I guess we were both a little, well, mad.
Well, I'm mad, too.
Quitting his job like that. Running off and getting married.
I don't know. This younger generation doesn't seem to have any sense.
So long, sweet. God bless you.
Goodbye, Dad.
That plane you gave me did the trick.
When they found out about my 600 hours in the air, they said, "Bud, we want you in."
Be nice to her, Dad. She'll grow on you.
Goodbye, boy.
He's gone, Dad.
Max, you have to do this for me and I don't want any arguments about it.
I'm afraid we got all the songs we need. Our catalogue is full.
Now wait a minute.
I've been to a lot of trouble to arrange this.
So grab your hat and a taxi and get right over here. Yes, now.
This very minute.
If you don't, I'll put the Irish curse on you. Goodbye, Father.
That's Father O'Dowd, a friend of mine.
What did he want? A donation?
No.
Pal of his has got a song, and he's plugging it.
And what a plug.
He's grabbed off the Metropolitan Opera House with the full orchestra... conducted by this fellow Tommaso... whatever his name is.
The star, Genevieve Linden and a choir of 30 voices.
All this fuss to put over a song written by a pal of his.
And they're waiting right now for us at the Met.
At the Metropolitan?
Can you imagine such a thing?

That's very good. Wonderful.
You sang it great.
Thank you.
That's a pretty good song you got there.
Thank you. I guess you ought to know.
You bet he does.
They say he's the sharpest little man in town.
I'm embarrassed.
You mean to talk business?
The money?
Don't let that embarrass you.
We love it. What I wanted to say is that, although it's great... it's just as I told you, Father.
It's too good for us.
It's way over our head. You see, it's not just the type of song that a guy would...
Pardon me, Father, that a gentleman... would croon to his babe, if you know what I mean.
It doesn't say enough. It hasn't got that...
Well, it's just not for me.
I think you ought to try it out on someone who publishes higher class stuff.
Thanks. Well, I guess we'd better get back to the office.
You know, Father, I could be wrong.
I hope I am. Goodbye.
Goodbye.
I'm sorry.
Well, we tried.
You sang it beautifully, Jenny. Boys, you did fine.
Not one mistake.
Thank you, Father.
If that isn't good, I'll go into the real estate business.
I was going to ask you and the boys to sing a little more... but maybe you don't feel like it now.
They sing divinely, and they look like Botticelli's angels.
Maybe a little something?
What do you think they'd like to hear?
The Mule.
The Mule.
The Mule?
Yeah.
Is that all right with you?
¶ Would you like to swing on a star ¶

Is that your song, Father?
Yes.
Well, we'll take a flier on that.
Did you hear that, Timmy?
You're a grand lad.
I knew your name wasn't Dolan for nothing.
Fellas, if you'll come to St. Dominic's... tomorrow morning at 10:30.
Church?
Max, a day in church isn't gonna hurt you that much.
Be there, and bring the cash with you.
Father O'Malley will tell you how he wants it paid.
An old man, dear friend of Father O'Malley's is involved in this:
Father Fitzgibbon.
It would make Father O'Malley very happy if you fellas would just do this his way. Church?
Church.
As you know, I've been here for 45 years.
Forty-six in October.
And during that time...
I've always asked you to be generous, which you have.
And now I have to ask you again.
You all know how I fl about St. Dominic's.
Well, we're in de financial stress.
So give what you can.
And I know that whatever you give... whether it's large or small, the good Lord will bless you for it.
In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. Amen.
Very gratifying.
And the Bishop thought I couldn't preach.
Thought I had a mouthful of clover. I wish he'd been here.
Father, now that you're practically wallowing in wealth... do you suppose I could have a half a dollar?
What for?
Father O'Dowd and I thought, with your permission, we'd play golf tomorrow.
I need a new golf ball.
If I lose it, I'll swear off. I'll quit.
Take 50 cents. No.
Take it out of the ladies' sodality.
They never keep any books.
You suppose I could buy Father O'Dowd one, too?
Must we?
I can get two nice repaints for 50 cents.
Give him 50 cents.
You ought to come along with us. You don't have to play.
Just go around.
The fresh air will do you good.
You can be our kibitzer.
Your what?
Kibitzer.
What's a kibitzer?
A sort of over-the-shoulder quarterback.
Will you come?
A little fresh air might do me good.
We'll get a ball for you, too. Of course.
Plenty of mushrooms around here.
Where did that go?
Right there.
Now, let me understand.
If you get the ball in the hole... in less hits than Father O'Dowd...
I win.
So you've got to count the number of blows?
That's right, Father. Step aside. He's gonna play now.
How many did you have?
Three?
How many?
That's remarkable.
Can you do that every time?
I've been known to miss, Father.
A strong crosswind or something.
Here, give me a holt of that.
You wanna try it?
Wait, I'll throw a ball in there for you. There you are.
Keep your head down now, Father. Watch your language.
Father, you holed out.
Not bad for a beginner.
You've played before.
No, believe me.
That's the first time I ever had a caddy in me hand.
Well, you better play and I'll watch then.
I guess I better be going.
Let that be a lesson to you, Father.
Don't trust anyone.
What an extraordinary person.
Isn't he?
Well, I'll sleep well tonight, anyway.
Think it must be that golf.
Shades of me childhood. You know, I feel 10 years younger.
You know, I was thinking, Father.
Now that everything is going so right... before something goes wrong, you ought to take a little time off.
To do what, for instance?
Well, like, for instance, take a trip home and see your mother.
The interest is all paid up to date.
Unless something goes wrong, I have plans that'll take care of the next payment.
You really think it would be all right?
I mean, that you'll take...
Father Fitzgibbon!
Chuck! The church is afire!
Don't worry, Father. We'll build again.
Can I help you, Father?
No, it's all right. I can manage.
It's for the birds.
They're used to coming here.
I don't want them to go away. No.
You see, Father? They're not leaving. Nobody's leaving you.
And when your church is rebuilt, they'll all be back.
Everyone will be back.
In the meantime, you can send your congregation over to my parish.
I'll split the collection with you. 50-50.
Take it, Father.
Now what makes you all so hopeful that the church will ever be rebuilt?
You're supposed to take this.
No, I can't.
Come on, please.
Take it. No.
I'll tell you what, if you'll take it, I'll take some, too.
There, now that wasn't so bad.
Don't you try it.
Doctors. Medicine.
What I need is to be up and about.
Being up and about is what got you down.
Tramping all over the parish to raise funds.
How much did you collect?
There's no need for you to rub it in.
$35.85.
Yeah.
How much is the doctor's bill?
$40. Says here to take two.
We wanna get our money's worth.
There's nothing in that bottle that's going to do me any good.
Now you're not gonna lose hope, are you?
Hope?
Chuck, when you're young, it's easy to keep the fires of hope burning bright.
But at my age, you're lucky if the pilot light doesn't go out.
I know, Father, 45 years of your efforts in ashes.
Here, take this.
That'll keep the pilot light burning.
Yes, it ought to. Tastes like it had kerosene in it.
Well, did you make your parish calls?
Yes. Mrs. McGonigle's rheumatism is kicking up again.
I told her to bury a potato in the backyard.
That's for warts.
That's what she said.
And I heard Mrs. Quimp's new gossip.
What else?
Then I went to see Carol and Mr. Haines.
Did they hear from young Ted?
Young Ted has been wounded in Africa.
Too bad.
They're shipping him home.
Fine, upstanding young fella.
Maybe they'll decorate him. No, I doubt it.
Some friend of his ran over him in a jeep.
But I've got some good news.
I have a letter from Miss Linden.
That's very nice. Where is she?
She's in St. Louis.
And here it comes. I gave you that medicine to quiet your nerves.
Tony and the boys are with her. They're on a concert tour.
They're on a what?
Now I had their parents' consent... and they'll be back in time for school.
But you...
Besides, travel's a great education.
If they make enough money, it's gonna build you a new church.
Not much of one, maybe, but something to go on with.
Miss Linden sent you a check with her love.
$3,500.
How's the pilot light burning now?
It's burning brighter, Chuck.
It's a long road back, but we've started.
You know, I've a feeling that St. Dominic's may rise again.
Sure it'll rise again.
You know, I think I'll get up meself.
You better stay there and get some rest.
I feel better.
No, you don't feel near that good.
Here now, boys.
Go on home.
Your dinner's ready. Go on home.
Bye, Father.
Goodbye, Father.
Bye, Father.
Fine girl, Miss Linden. Very thoughtful. Very generous.
Let's close this up. Keep the sawdust out.
That will lend beauty to the dedication.
And at Christmas, you and the choir will be able to...
Father, I won't be here at Christmas.
I was with the Bishop this afternoon, and he's transferring me to another parish.
You're leaving me.
It never occurred to me that someday you might.
But, me boy, what am I going to do without you?
You didn't ask to?
No. I asked to stay with you.
But the Bishop asked me to help him out, and I...
St. Dominic's. What's going to happen?
Well, you'll be all right, Father.
I wish you could've heard some of the things the Bishop said about you.
Says you're looking 10 years younger.
He has all the confidence in the world in you.
Don't worry. You'll have a new assistant.
I want to wish you all the success in the world, which I know you'll have.
Is it a parish of your own?
Not exactly, Father.
You see this church, St. Charles, it's...
Well, the pastor's getting along in years and things aren't...
You mean they're in trouble.
Yes. And I'm supposed to go in there and try and help...
You mean without the old fella knowing.
Well, that's a difficult assignment.
But it'll work out.
You may have trouble with the old man at first.
He may be running off to the Bishop every few minutes,
You'll bring him around to your way of thinking.
Well, there's dinner.
You know how to manage these old fussbudgets.
Take him out on the golf course.
Bring him out in the fresh air.
We'll get along.
Just so he...
He knows enough to come out of the rain.
That's it, Father. That's it exactly.
Come in, Tony.
Hi, Father. So you're really leaving us?
Yes, I've got my orders, Tony.
I guess when the Bishop says you gotta go, you gotta go.
That's right, Tony.
Sometimes I think I don't like bishops.
Tony, bishops are like umpires.
You have to have them to call the close decisions.
Really?
I got a little Christmas present here for you.
I want you to take my place with the choir.
From now on, you're in charge.
That's swell of you, Father. It's a great present.
I always had my eye on it.
I thought you did.
When you gonna give Father Fitzgibbon his surprise?
Not so loud. Later on in the church.
Those boys haven't told anybody?
Not a word. If they did, I'd kick the...
I mean, I'd be disappointed in them.
I guess I'll get going.
I know you wanted to tell me about taking your place with the gang... but I'll make it easy for you.
I'll be everything you want me to be.
Just as if you were here checking on me. If you don't, I'm gonna drop you like you was a hot potato.
It's a deal.
Good luck to you.
Good luck to you. So long.
Pretty near Christmas.
I'm sure that the way to say what I'd like to say will occur to me after you've gone.
We're separated by many years, Father O'Malley... which could be the reason why we haven't seen eye to eye in many instances.
But though we've had many differences, we never differed in fundamentals.
It was only in method.
But never in our hearts.
Good stuff, huh? Yes.
Goodbye, Ted.
Goodbye, Father.
Bye, Carol. Right man did come along?
Yes, but not past our house.
Stubborn?
Goodbye, Mr. Haines.
Father.
Pardon me, Mr. Haines.
I've just left the Bishop. He told me to report to Father Fitzgibbon.
I'm taking your place. I'm the new curate!
You've little time.
They're waiting at the church to say goodbye.
All right. I've been doing you a lot of good here.
You're gonna have a new church after the war.
Yes, but we didn't raise enough money.
Mr. Haines is gonna give us a mortgage to take care of the difference.
He convinced me I have a heart.
It wouldn't be a church without a mortgage.
That's right.
He's a wonder.
I don't know what I'm going to do without him.
Don't know who the Bishop is going to send in his place... but whoever he is...
Father.
Congratulations to you, Father.
The Bishop wouldn't do that to me again.
Yes, he's done it.
Mr. Haines. Nice of you to give that mortgage to the church.
Not at all.
Can't tell you how much we appreciate it.
As you know... we're all going to miss Father O'Malley.
He was a fine man.
This is Father O'Malley, the man who sent for you.
How do you do, Mrs. Fitzgibbon?
I've heard so much about you. Now it's good to see you.
I think you'll agree that we're all a little better for having known him.
He was always thinking of others.
And that, you know, can make life very beautiful.
Believe me, it's what we do for others that...
Are you number two boat?
Faster!
He was on number one last time I saw him.
Ahoy there!
Lady, you don't look like somebody that's just been shipwrecked.
Man, I certainly feel like it!
Did you see anything of Charcoal?
Who?
Joe, the steward.
He helped me into the lifeboat with my things.
I thought this boat was abandoned.
Not by me, it wasn't.
It looked pretty good to me.
What part of the ship are you from, darling?
Engine room.
I was off duty in the washroom.
Caught with my...
I was washing my hands when the torpedo smacked us.
Most of the crew were trapped like rats.
When they got to topside, it was a shambles.
Quite a night!
Reminds me of an air raid once that hit me in Chungking.
Reminded me of a slaughterhouse I once worked at in Chicago.
Those Nazi buzzards in tin fish ain't enough... They've got to shell us too!
Ha! Now I can perfect my backhand.
Get that! It might come in handy.
Let's have the cap too.
What are we worryin' about this junk for?
Let's take a look for the others before that U-boat surfaces again and sees us.
She won't surface. One of our shells got her.
Are you sure?
She was killed dead, darling. Went down like a rock.
Did you see it?
It's all in here, my pet.
You're Constance Porter.
I heard you were aboard.
So you took pictures?
And what pictures. Priceless!
Oh, I caught some wonderful shots on deck.
A little knot of people around one of the lifeboats.
They look slow and heavy and fat with the life belts on, so lonesome.
Then a shell hit the lifeboat. They all jumped overboard.
I got a beautiful shot of the gun crew firing at the submarine.
But the best of all was in the boat, here, with Joe.
I got the freighter going down, one of the lifeboats caught in the suction and pulled under.
I got some of the U-boat crew jumping overboard and I also got — Look!
That's a perfect touch!
What did you do that for?
Why don't you wait for the baby to float by and photograph that?
Help!
Gangway!
You stupid, clumsy, son-of-a —
Why don't you look where you're going? Absolutely irreplaceable stuff.
Priceless. The best film I ever took! - Goes to the bottom of the sea!
That's better than going there yourself!
I wouldn't have parted with that film for a million dollars!
When will I ever get stuff like that again?
Of all the stupid, clumsy —
Maybe we can arrange another shipwreck for you sometime.
Sparks, did you have time to send out an SOS?
Hardly. The first shell from the U-boat did for the radio shack!
Keep going, Kovac, there's more people out there!
Where'd this come from?
It was floating by.
Miss MacKenzie!
Stanley!
She's out there! She's alive.
Come on, Kovac! Come on!
There's somebody out there.
To your right, Kovac!
There's three of them.
Swing over, Kovac!
Hurry, we've got a wounded man!
Step on it!
A dame!
Never mind me. Help him. He's hurt his leg!
Well, hang on, Miss!
Well, folks, we're in business again.
Somebody gonna give me a hand?
Ritt! - You old rat!
Connie!
Did you come from the freighter or the Stork Club?
Still striking oil, I see, eh, Ritt?
Anybody got any liquor?
I'll have this off you in a jiffy.
I'm okay, Sparks.
What happened to Nolan?
I was on my way from the bridge to bring him our position. A shell from the U-boat hit the radio shack!
I was at the wheel waiting' for Hennessy to relieve me.
Just set the mug up with some hot java when —
Holy smokes! Look at this mess.
Maybe we'd better get the raft back.
Do you think we'll stay afloat?
If the buoyancy tanks are okay she'll float, even if we're waterlogged.
I see you've even managed to get some of your luggage aboard.
Just the bare necessities.
Uh, look at that! Six full boxes, and I had to grab this one.
Don't cry, my pet. It'll last until we're picked up.
I hope.
First shell must've done for the skipper.
And most of the gun crew.
What happened to the woman with the baby?
See if you can find a first-aid kit.
I thought everybody was killed. I never expected to see you alive.
You know I'm practically immortal, Ritt!
I — I thought I was done for.
See, we were playing poker in the saloon —
Now, how do you get this thing off?
Here's the first-aid kit.
It's been pretty well smashed up. Oh!
I need something to cover him up with.
Let me have that blanket, please.
Bandages, please.
Well, share and share alike, I always say!
Lie down, please.
What for?
You'll be more comfortable.
I wanna take a look at your leg.
Oh, well, okay, babe.
Maybe you'll let me return the compliment someday!
Lie down, please.
I think it's got a hunk of slug in it.
It was the biggest pot of the game, but believe you me, I never even stopped to collect it.
That pot went to Davy Jones.
Well, not all of it.
Here's 20 bucks Mr Jones didn't get.
Well, it's yours.
It was floating in the water.
Well, keep it. No, go on! I insist!
You one of the crew, son?
Black gang. Oiler. Name's Kovac.
Kovac, eh?
My name's Rittenhouse.
Rittenhouse?
That's right!
C.J. Rittenhouse?
C.J. Rittenhouse!
Junior.
Here.
Are you sure there's no sulfanilamide eft in the kit?
Afraid not.
Hurt?
No.
Here's the shrapnel. Thought you might like to keep it as a souvenir.
Nah! My hide was full of that stuff on the last trip.
Hold it steady!
I oughta have my head examined.
This is the fourth time I've shipped out since the war, and I ain't got no place yet!
Gee, I wish I could make the complete round-trip just once.
How does it look?
It's a pretty deep cut.
It's leakin'.
I ain't gonna wind up with a gimpy leg, am I?
No! Not enough to interfere with your jitterbugging!
Jive, huh?
Eh, tell her, Sparks!
Why he's the champion hoofer of the merchant marines.
Tell her what I done in Jersey City.
Listen, I copped two prizes at Roseland one year, and all the time, I'm suffering somethin' terrible from double pneumonia.
I can out-jive the rest of those hepcats even with a bum gam.
Everything under control? Anything I can do?
You ain't got somethin' to drink on ya?
Sorry, son!
Not a drop. - I have some brandy, darling.
Oh, boy! I could sure go for some of that.
I'll get my flask. - No!
In a case like this, the rule is to —
Come on! We're among friends, ain't we?
I don't think it's advisable.
Look! Just one slug. It'll pick me up!
Make up your minds, darlings!
Help!
Help!
It's Charcoal!
It's the steward!
There's a woman.
Easy there!
Give me the baby!
Are you all right, Joe?
I got my feet wet a little bit.
She was fightin' me all the time in the water.
She tried to drown the baby and herself with it.
Huh, it's all right, sister. You're safe. The baby's safe.
It's all right. The danger's over.
You're safe now. Nothing to worry about.
Best let her have it. We'll wait till she's asleep.
Here!
That's right!
Her name's Higley.
She was bombed out in Bristol.
One of them shell shock cases sent to America. Her child was born in New York.
Said to me on the ship, "I'm going home to show my husband the baby!"
Here, darling. You'd better put this on.
Hey, look.
Another customer.
Where'd he come from?
Is he a crew member?
I never saw him before.
Danke schön.
He's very grateful to us for having saved his life.
Regrets very much the U-boat was compelled to sink our ship.
Ask him why they shelled our lifeboats.
Captain's orders!
If you ask me, he's the captain himself.
Ask him if he's the captain.
He says he's not a captain or officer, just a crew member.
Well, crew member or skipper, he's German!
A guy can't help being German if he's born a German, can he?
Neither can a snake help being a rattlesnake if he's born a rattlesnake! That don't make him a nightingale!
Get him outta here!
Don't be silly, darling!
He can't very well get off in the middle of the ocean, can he?
Throw him off!
Have you gone out of your mind?
Throw the Nazi buzzard overboard!
That's out of the question! - It's against the law.
Whose law?
We're on our own. We can make our own law!
Now, just a minute!
He was acting under orders.
Our freighter was an enemy ship. After all, we're at war.
Is that woman at war? Is her baby at war?
And listen, how come you know the lingo so well?
How come when I climbed into this lifeboat you were the only one in it, all dressed up like you knew you were going someplace?
I was going someplace. I was going into a lifeboat.
What is this? Are you insinuating?
You seem pretty anxious to stand up for your friend here!
What do you mean, "my friend"?
Now, children, let's keep our shirts on!
I haven't got a shirt or a mink coat either!
Oh, I get it!
A fellow traveller! I thought the Comintern was dissolved!
Now, we're all sort of fellow travellers, in a mighty small boat, on a mighty big ocean!
And the more we quarrel and criticize and misunderstand each other, the bigger the ocean gets, and the smaller the boat.
The boat's too small for me and this German!
Me, I'm perfectly willing to abide by the decision of the majority. That's the American way.
If we harm this man, we are guilty of the same tactics you hate him for.
On the other hand, if we treat him with kindness and consideration, we might be able to convert him to our way of thinking.
That's the, uh... That's the Christian way.
Okay! Now, me, I'm American too. I was born one in Chicago.
But my people are from Czechoslovakia!
Ever hear of that place?
I say let's throw him overboard and watch him drown!
When he goes down, I'll dance a jig like Hitler did when France went down!
Me, too!
Just for the record, I'm an American, myself!
I'm in a kind of a spot.
My name is Schmidt, but I changed it to Smith.
That's what I got against these guys more than anything else.
They make me ashamed of the name I was born with.
I got a lot of relatives in Germany.
For all I know, this guy may be one of them!
I say, throw him to the sharks!
No, Gus!
I don't say it wouldn't be a pleasure, mind you, but — we haven't got the right!
The right"? What do you mean, "the right"?
Well, he's a prisoner of war. Got to be treated as such.
The way it's done is to hang on to him till we're picked up, then turn him over to proper authorities.
Till such time, we represent the authorities.
That's clear, isn't it?
You see what I mean, miss?
I don't understand any of it.
I don't understand people hurting each other and killing each other.
I just don't understand it.
Then what are you doing in a uniform?
I'm doing the only thing I can.
Trying to put them together again when they get hurt.
As far as the German's concerned, I — I agree with Stanley.
So do I.
I'll talk to the man. Maybe I can get some information from him.
Material for your book?
Incidentally!
George?
What do you say, Joe?
Do I get to vote too?
Why certainly!
Guess I'd rather stay out of this.
How about you, sister?
My baby's dead.
Does anyone know the service for burial at sea?
Well, I, uh... I suppose, any prayer would do.
Let me see, now.
The Lord is my shepherd. Uh, I shall not want.
He maketh me to lie down in green pastures. He, uh...
He, uh...
He leadeth me beside the still waters.
He restoreth my soul.
He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness, for His name's sake.
Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I will fear no evil.
For thou art with me.
Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me.
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life.
And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.
Amen.
Well, I don't know how much of this stuff is any use to us.
Isn't much we can do with these food compartments.
Well, at any rate, things are getting shipshape.
None of the buoyancy tanks seem to have been smashed.
The water breaker's been taped up, and in the morning we'll rig up a sail and get going.
And in the meantime, I think, we'd all better try and get some sleep.
Uh, Kovac, don't forget to wake me for my watch.
We'd better send up another flare soon.
How do you feel, darling?
Better, thank you!
Much better!
Have I been asleep long?
Not very.
What's this?
Mrs Porter lent you her coat to help keep you warm.
It's a beautiful coat.
Is it real mink?
I hope so.
It's lovely.
I've always admired mink.
It's the most ladylike fur there is, I always said.
So warm and comfortable.
Thank you so much for letting me wear it.
Where's Johnny?
Where's my baby?
What have you done with him?
What did you do with my baby?
Your baby's dead!
Don't you remember?
You killed him, didn't you?
Poor little thing!
The sea... so big and terrible.
Johnny, it's Mum!
Where are you?
Where are you, Johnny?
Johnny!
Let me go!
Let me go to him!
Get a rope, somebody! We've got to tie her down!
Here you are.
Let me go to him.
Let me go.
Good morning, sir!
Hmm? Oh! Good morning, Sparks!
Asleep on watch! It's a fine thing! I oughta be court-martialed!
I wonder how much we've drifted.
Not very far with that sea-anchor out.
Oh, the sea-anchor, of course. You know, I had no idea what those things looked like.
I thought they were big, heavy iron things with a hook to hold us onto the sea bottom.
When you threw that thing out, I thought it was some sort of a toy parachute or something.
They really keep the boat from drifting?
Last time I was adrift, a sea anchor held us up 48 hours in a storm.
You've been torpedoed before?
That's right, twice.
How long before you were picked up?
Last time, it was 43 days.
Forty-three...
That must have been awful!
Yeah! We did get a bit sunburned.
Then, of course, we had a good sound boat. Plenty of food and water. Everything intact.
Well, haven't we plenty too?
A good deal of our food's been ruined.
Three out of the four water breakers have been smashed.
A lot of water leaked out of the fourth one before it was taped.
What worries me is the compass.
Knocked to pieces.
That's a bit awkward.
And, of course, there's Jerry.
Ah, good morning, Mrs Porter.
What's good about it?
How soon do we get picked up?
Good morning, Connie. We were discussing that.
It seems there's no way of telling.
Did you sleep well?
Not a wink.
Not only that. I froze.
Only had my fur coat to keep me... warm.
Where's Miss Higley?
I'm sorry, folks. I'm terribly sorry.
It was pitch black when I relieved you, Kovac.
I couldn't see a thing.
For all I know, it might have happened during your watch.
Eight biscuits.
Minus eight biscuits!
Oh, thanks. - Kovac, how's the sail coming along?
Coming along!
Light, sir?
Uh, no, thanks!
I think, I'll hoard this heater till we get someplace.
Well, folks, I've been taking inventory, and we're in the black.
A going concern.
It's no use lying around, waiting to be picked up.
As we might have to wait as long as, uh... as 43 days.
So we might as well get organized.
The first order of business is department heads.
Uh, Sparks?
Yes, Mr Rittenhouse.
Call me Ritt. We're all in the same boat.
Yes, sir.
Sparks, you are, uh, in charge of navigation.
Aye, aye, sir!
Uh, George?
Call me Joe.
Is your name Joe?
Yes, sir.
Very well.
Joe it is.
You are head of the commissary.
Yes, sir.
Connie, will you keep the ship's log, please?
Righto, Ritto, providing I control the copyright and all publication rights.
Including the Scandinavian!
Yes! Miss MacKenzie!
You are in charge of sick bay.
Don't look now, but I think we have a skipper.
Who elected Mr Rittenhouse?
Mr Rittenhouse.
Ritt, to you!
You think he's capable?
Sure! Till the sail goes up.
We never should've let him stay on board.
He'll eat our food, drink our water, and double-cross us, first chance he gets.
What are you afraid of? He's one against seven.
It was eight yesterday. Or have you forgotten?
There's a piece in here about some people who were adrift in a lifeboat for 80 days.
Say, maybe we can beat that record.
Heaven forbid!
We might even get in the newsreels.
Rosie'd get a bang outta that.
It'd remind her of the first cup we won at the Garden for marathon dancing.
We danced 80 consecutive hours.
Consecutive?
Well, 10 minutes off, every four hours, for coffee, cake — stuff like that.
How'd you feel after 80 hours of dancing?
I had a slight headache, but Rosie, she was just gettin' wound up.
She grabbed a cab, went right over to Roseland!
Does she work there?
She lives there.
How does the leg feel now?
It don't feel at all.
I wish I could walk around.
I sure hope that thing don't leave me gimpy.
Al'd love that.
Who's Al?
Al Magaroulian.
He's an Armenian rug-cutter.
He knew Rosie before I did.
He's got fallen arches.
Keeps him outta the draft, but not outta Roseland.
Kovac, you know something about machinery, don't you?
A little.
See if you can fix this clasp.
Mrs Porter, I've read a lot of your stuff.
You wanna know what's the matter with it?
No, do tell me.
You've been all over the world. You've met all kinds of people.
But you never write about them, you only write about yourself.
You think this whole war's a show put on for you to cover, like a Broadway play.
And if enough people die before the last act, maybe you might give it four stars.
Come on, Sparks. - All right, tovarich! Now, listen to me!
Heads up!
Joe, man the tiller till we're squared away!
Well, folks, we're under way.
Where to?
Where are we going?
First operator said we were headed for Bermuda.
Well, good! Uh, Sparks, you'd better take the tiller.
Yes, sir!
Uh, what about the course?
Does anybody here know the course to Bermuda?
I was at the wheel when we got punctured.
The course was 115 east-southeast.
Fine, then, east-southeast it is.
Yes, sir!
But, uh, where is east-southeast?
Without a compass...
What's the matter with the sun?
With the sun this high, it's pretty hard to tell the points of the compass.
I think it's out that way.
You think?
Doesn't anybody know?
He says east-southeast is that direction.
How's he know?
Well, he ought to know. His U-boat was operating around here, wasn't it?
Do you suppose he'd lead us to Bermuda, British territory?
He says he'd rather be a prisoner of war in Bermuda than here.
At least he'd have good food and a bed.
I wouldn't trust anything he says.
Kovac, you're so prejudiced, you can't think straight.
If anybody's in the position to know where we are and where Bermuda is, he's the one.
Who says so?
We'll follow the German's course.
Who elected you skipper?
Well, I... 'Course, if there's anybody else you'd prefer...
What do you know about a ship?
He just happens to own a shipyard, that's all.
Has he ever been in it?
He has thousands of employees.
Of course he knows how to handle men.
Not in a lifeboat.
What we need is an able seaman, and we've got one.
Who, me?
I'm a disabled seaman.
Anyhow, I never did have no executive ability.
I think maybe Sparks there...
I know a bit about navigation, but when it comes to taking charge of a boat, well...
What about Kovac?
That clunk run this boat?
With what? An oil can?
If you're talking about a skipper, we have a skipper right on this boat.
He wasn't the captain.
Wasn't he?
Herr Kapitän?
Ja?
Well, I'm a monkey's uncle.
There! You have a man who's familiar with these waters.
He knows seamanship and navigation. What about it?
You want to turn the boat over to the man who sunk our ship and shelled our lifeboats?
I want you to turn the boat over to the man obviously best qualified to run it.
You're crazy.
Now, wait a minute.
There are two sides to everything. Let's look at this calmly and reasonably.
The German is just as anxious to get to safety as we are, and if he's a trained skipper, why shouldn't he take charge?
Because I'm taking charge.
Since when?
As of now, I'm skipper.
Anybody who don't like it can get out and swim to Bermuda.
I'll buy it.
Suits me.
What about you, miss?
I'm for it.
Yes, sir!
Well, if the rest agree...
All right, Commissar, what's the course?
Well, we...
Which way'd you say, Sparks?
Out there.
He says if you go your way, you'll only head further out to sea.
He insists the course to Bermuda is that way.
We'll head this way. Take the tiller, Sparks!
Aye, aye, sir!
Careful!
Including the Scandinavian.
How do you feel now, Connie?
Awful! It isn't the sea that makes me sick, it's the loss of my typewriter.
That typewriter went with me everywhere... Rome, Berlin, Paris, London.
Oh, quit grousing.
Why shouldn't I grouse?
Little by little, I'm being stripped of all my earthly possessions.
First, my beautiful stocking, then my camera.
I don't mind the loss of the camera so much, but the film in it.
I get positively ill when I think about it.
Hey, do you remember the boom we had after the last war?
Well, the boom we're gonna have after this one'll make the last look like a mild flurry.
Then my steamer rug goes, then my fur coat, and now my typewriter!
Take China, for example.
400 million customers waiting to sign on the dotted line as soon as peace is declared.
I never should've taken the freighter. Should've gone by clipper.
Me, too! I'd have been in Spain by this time.
Spain?
Were you going for the state department?
State department? Certainly not! I was going for C. J. Rittenhouse.
What for?
What for? Why, my dear fellow!
Pipe down, Ritt! The "Gay-Pay-oo"!
What are you doing with my memo pad?
I borrowed it from you to make a deck of cards.
Never heard such impertinence, opening my bag!
It was open.
How about a little draw poker?
Eh, suits me fine.
Deal you in?
With a deck you've made, darling?
What are you gonna play for?
Dollar limit?
That'll do for a starter.
Cut for deal!
All right!
You deal!
What are those letters on your diaphragm?
Love letters.
Oh, you believe in advertising?
Open!
Never could understand this quaint habit of making a billboard out of one's torso.
Stay!
Three cards!
I must say you've shown the most commendable delicacy in just tattooing the initial, not printing the names, addresses and telephone numbers.
Open!
Nines?
Queens!
See, how many are there? One, two, three, four, five.
Remind me to show you the rest of them sometime.
Your deal, my boy.
And see, you deal them off the top.
You mean, you're used to people dealing off the bottom?
I was just joking.
I never thought I'd go into it.
I used to faint at the sight of blood.
What made you join the merchant marine?
I don't know. Never thought about it.
I suppose it was 'cause I lived in Greenwich.
Maybe it was the river there, and the ships.
It's the first time I've ever been to sea.
I was born and raised in the wheat country.
You know, sometimes when the wind blows through the wheat, it looks something like the sea.
Well, it's not a bad life, the merchant marine, except for the U-boats.
After a while, you get to taking even them in your stride.
It's rather scary the first time, though, isn't it?
I'm glad the freighter was torpedoed.
My dear young lady, what an extraordinary thing to say!
What are you doing that for?
It's the bandage, Lu. It's too tight or something.
Oh, wait!
Holy mackerel!
Ain't it a lulu?
What about it, Miss? I don't know!
I'm afraid it... looks more like a leg of lamb, don't it?
Get away from here!
Tell him to get back to his place before I throw him overboard!
What did he say?
Gus, I'm afraid your leg's very bad.
Gangrene?
It'll have to be amputated at once!
I've never even assisted in an amputation.
He says, being an enemy and, technically, our prisoner, perhaps you wouldn't want to trust him with the operation, but he's willing to do it.
What the devil does he know about it?
He says he was a surgeon in civilian life.
He's done many operations.
If he did, they were probably illegal.
If he's a medical man, why isn't he in medical service?
I don't know and I don't care!
Perhaps the gangrene isn't legal, either, but it's there!
The leg has to come off.
No dice!
I don't want no operation!
Darling, you want to live, don't you?
Not with one leg.
Don't be a sap, Gus!
You don't understand.
Sure, I do! Rosie!
What's Rosie got to do with it?
Everything! If I lose my leg, I lose Rosie.
Of course, I don't know Rosie.
She loves to dance. It's her hobby. It's her whole life.
Put yourself in her place. Do you like to dance?
Mad about it!
Well, then, what good's a hepcat with one gam missing'?
If my leg goes, Rosie goes!
If she's that kind of a —
Don't you call Rosie that kind of a —
I oughta know. I introduced you to her, didn't I?
No, you didn't! Al Magaroulian introduced me to her.
I knew her before Al Magaroulian did.
Al Magaroulian —
The heck with Al Magaroulian!
What's he got to do with it?
Rosie's as good as anybody.
And a darn sight better.
If she was the right kind of a woman...
Kovac, you take that back!
Darling, don't pay any attention to this human 24-sheet!
Listen to me!
I don't know Rosie, but I know women.
Some of my best friends are women.
And one of 'em's that kind of a —
What kind of a?
Well, an independent creature who lives her own life!
That's Rosie all over.
With a heart of gold. And she gives it away.
Rosie'd give the shirt off her back to anybody.
She's got a heart as big as her head.
And you wanna break it.
Who, me?
Well, you'd rather die than trust her!
Who says I don't trust her?
It's Al Magaroulian I don't trust!
He knew her before I did.
She swore to me there was nothing between them, but —
Maybe there wasn't.
But Rosie's human like everybody else, and it ain't like we was married, or had a home and all.
Maybe we shoulda got hitched before I left on that last trip.
I shoulda took care of that insurance.
Rosie kept askin' me about it.
The kid's always thinkin' of me.
That's why you've got to think of her, back home, putting on a big show, laughing and dancing, pretending to be having a good time.
And all the while, her heart's aching, torn with loneliness and uncertainty.
Not knowing whether you're dead or alive.
Then, at last, to find out that you risked your life, perhaps even died, just because you had no faith in her?
God, forgive me!
Poor kid, she'd be broken-hearted when she —
Well, let's go!
What are we all waitin' for?
He'll need a pail of water, Joe.
Is there any sort of anaesthetic?
You have some brandy, haven't you?
He says brandy's better than nothing.
Did I hear brandy?
Let me get it for you.
Oh, thanks, Joe!
Can you open it for me?
That's right. It's just here.
Here, darling.
Hi-yo, Silver.
He'll need a tourniquet, a belt or something.
I'll lose my pants if I take mine off.
How about your belt, Sparks?
Here it is.
Get it, Joe.
It was nice knowin' ya.
Um, oh, Joe! He wants a needle and twine from the, uh, boat kit or something.
It's in a ditty bag, Joe.
Am I gonna feel good pretty soon.
Kovac, why'd you want to say that about Rosie?
Say what?
What you said.
I'm sorry, Gus.
Take it back!
Okay, I take it back.
What can we use for forceps?
You have tweezers?
I've got tweezers.
Yes, Joe, you'll find them in my bag. - The little box on the top.
Right.
Ask him how much of that stuff he can drink.
Go ahead, Gus! The works!
Down the hatch!
I'll never forget you.
Joe, clear away some of that stuff.
We'll lay him out here. We'll need something for weights to hold it down.
Kovac, you know what I think of that no-good, snake-in-the-grass friend of yours, Al Magaroulian?
Magaroulian's no friend of mine.
Magaroulian's a skunk.
Two-legged skunk.
I hate his guts.
You're okay, pal.
Hi, Lu!
Hiya, Gus!
Well, anyway, it's an experience!
I oughta have my head examined.
I didn't have to go to sea.
I coulda got a job in a defence plant making good dough.
I coulda joined the army, or even the navy.
'Stead of that, I got assigned on a stinking ol' rust bucket.
Mr Rittenhouse?
Yes, son?
Call me Gus!
Hiya, babe!
Hi, toots!
Give us a kiss, will ya?
Hey, Joe.
What'd ya stop playin' for?
Come on! Give us a little music!
No, no! None of that slicker music!
Come on! Come on! Boogie it up!
Tell him to hold the boat as steady as possible.
Steady as you go, Sparks!
Righto!
Saying a thing like that!
Just because she likes to dance and have a good time!
Nobody's gonna call Rosie —
Hey, Kovac!
You're a no-good heel.
Take his backrest away.
All right!
Look alive now, Sparks!
Bring more bandages!
Joe!
Mr Kovac!
Keep her steady, you fool!
Open.
Stay.
Three cards.
Bet one.
Nines.
Queens.
Give 'em a good shuffle. Okay, cut 'em.
Fill another inside straight, I'll cut your throat!
It's lucky for Gus we had somebody aboard who knew how to meet an emergency like this.
Two more cards, darling.
You know, by golly, the thing that got me —
Say, what are you two gabbing about?
Currents. Not the pie kind, darling, the ocean kind.
Fascinating subject, currents. They're either for you or agin you.
Connie, darling, do you stay or do you pass?
Ritt, darling, I've already stayed.
Yeah, well, it'll cost you two bucks more.
Connie!
Hold your horses, darling!
Women and poker!
I'll stay.
Fortunately, Kapitän seems to think we're on a favouring current, quite swift.
We got a favouring breeze, too.
Good! Then we ought to be in Bermuda in no time.
I hope so, for Gus's sake.
That is, if we're on the right course.
Well, does he still think we're not?
He didn't say anything about it.
Well, ask him!
One can't be sure without a compass.
He was pretty certain a few hours ago.
Yeah! I wonder what made him change his mind.
We probably drifted somewhat on account of the current.
We've been through all that. What's he doing in this part of the boat, anyway?
Why?
Is he in quarantine?
Tell him to get back to the bow.
I'll do nothing of the sort.
You may be skipper of this lifeboat, but you're not dictator! Or are you?
Wait a minute, Kovac! There's no sense treating the man like a leper.
He did save Gus's life, you know.
For the time being. After all, it was an emergency operation.
Don't you realize that it's imperative we get Gus to a hospital as soon as possible?
Sure, I do.
Then, why not listen to somebody who knows?
How do you like that? Now he isn't sure! Says he won't take responsibility!
But that's not the point! The point is, are we headed for Bermuda?
What's come over the man?
All you got to do is answer yes or no.
He admits, we're on the wrong course.
Admits"?
He's only saying what he said before.
I had to drag it out of him.
He says — - I don't care what he says!
Yeah, but suppose he's right!
That's my funeral.
No, it's not. It's Gus's funeral!
Whose funeral?
Hey, wait a minute! What is this?
Well, fella, how do you feel now, huh?
In the pink. Outside of a little hangover.
Right now I'd give the other leg for a cigarette.
Here, darling.
Guess maybe I lost a little weight, huh?
You'll be all right, Gus.
He did a swell job.
Danke schön.
Well, skipper, how soon do we get to Bermuda?
Pretty soon, Gus.
We've got a good breeze and a favouring current.
There's a little difference of opinion about the direction we're headed.
Trouble is, I'm not sure about our course.
I'm only sure of one thing. I don't trust that Nazi.
There must be other submarines around and he knows where they are.
Or maybe a supply ship! He knows where that is too.
On general principle, I'd copper anything he says. That's how I stand.
You agree with me, Sparks?
Does anybody agree with me?
You're the skipper!
All right, Sparks.
Follow the German's course.
I, uh, was admiring your bracelet.
Gift from a husband.
It's gorgeous.
My first husband.
Glad the freighter was torpedoed.
What?
That's what you said yesterday.
That was a stupid thing to say!
I didn't mean it, exactly.
What did you mean, exactly?
I only meant, I was rather glad that we...
Well, I wasn't particularly anxious to get to London.
What are you afraid of in London?
Myself.
I mean, uh, it's a personal problem.
In other words, I...
I know, darling!
I know! Genus Homo.
Male.
And married, but not to me.
You call that a problem?
It is to me.
Fiddlesticks!
I don't want to pry into your personal affairs, darling, but you know what's the matter with you?
You've been reading Kipling. "The sins ye do by two and two you must pay for, one by one!"
'Course I don't know who the guy is.
But I know men...
especially married men!
Some of my best friends —
Don't let her upset you.
She certainly has a way of getting at things.
That's right.
I didn't mind her prying, really.
I wanted to talk.
Maybe that's why I'm all mixed up, because I've never told anybody.
I think I'd rather tell you than anybody.
His name is Stephen.
He's a doctor.
We worked in the same hospital.
All the time, I knew he was married.
His wife's a fine woman, and they have two beautiful children.
So, you see, it was hopeless. It was quite hopeless.
Yes, of course! I... I see!
Well, we both decided to forget about it.
And when he enlisted and was sent to London, I was glad.
I was really glad.
I tried to forget him, but I couldn't.
He wrote several times.
I never answered.
And then when I was assigned to London myself...
Well, I knew if we met there, away from home, away from every —
I'm sorry.
Maybe I'd better wait till I get home and take it up with Mr Whosits on the Goodwill Hour.
Sometimes that programme's funny.
Sometimes it isn't a bit.
When people are in trouble, they turn themselves inside-out.
Seem to feel better when they get some sort of an answer.
Whether they get an answer or not, they feel better.
Thank you, Stanley.
Lovely night we're having.
Lots of stars out tonight.
I remember the night before we was torpedoed.
Nolan was — He was my first.
Yes, I met him on the boat.
That's right.
Yes. He was telling me all about his wife going to stay with her family in Bermuda.
And how it's changed since the war.
He told me that...
I remember as he pointed out our course over the bows,
I saw the planet Mars low on the horizon.
That's Mars over there, to the right.
And that's Venus.
We're headed for Venus. We're going East.
We're not heading for Bermuda.
We're heading to miss Bermuda.
Well, we'll see about that.
After all, we did have to drag it out of...
That's part of the trick. He made suckers out of all of us.
Kovac, I still say, we have no right to condemn the man without a hearing.
Perhaps the course he gave us was wrong, but that doesn't prove anything.
He might have been mistaken.
When I questioned him yesterday, he didn't want to commit himself.
He said one couldn't be sure without a compass.
The thing to do is to wake him up and question him.
We'll get nothing but lies.
That's what he was brought up on.
And I was brought up under the idea that a man is innocent until he's proved guilty.
What do you want me to do? Appoint one of us to be his lawyer?
But don't you see, without a compass...
Mrs Porter, remember yesterday, you looked at your watch and told the German the time?
Yes!
Did he ask you the time?
Of course he did.
That's funny.
What's funny about it?
He had a watch of his own.
Well, what of it?
If he had a watch, why would he have to ask Mrs Porter for the time?
That doesn't prove anything.
Lots of times I have my own watch in my pocket and I ask somebody the time.
It just, uh... It just saves time, that's all.
But he looked at his own watch just before he asked Mrs Porter.
Perhaps his own watch stopped.
I remember when he asked for the time, he took a squint at the sun.
What are you trying to do? Convict a man because he looks at the sun?
Is it a crime to ask for the time?
Certainly not. - What time is it?
Ten past 7:00.
I think you're slow.
Slow?
That's a Philippe Patek.
I wanna know what time it is by the German's watch.
Well, why don't you wake him up and ask him?
Don't have to wake him up. Not with Joe around.
Joe.
Yeah?
Operate.
Do your stuff.
What stuff? I don't know what you mean.
Frisk him for his turnip.
I cut that stuff out a long time ago.
But this is an emergency. - The folks'll understand.
Understand what?
Joe used to be one of the best all-around —
Now, wait a minute, Gus!
You ain't got no right bringing' up what used to be.
That's all right, Joe. Some of my best friends are —
I know, but I made a pledge, a solemn pledge.
Do you wanna commit mutiny?
Is it an order?
It's an order.
Oh, I can't. The guy's asleep.
That's a break, isn't it?
Yeah, but it's like... It's like shootin' a sittin' duck!
Quit stalling! If your conscience bothers you, wake him up! Only, get the ticker!
Kovac!
Looks like quite a blow.
Pardon me! I'm... sorry!
Now, you know the right time.
Dirty double-crossing rat!
Kovac, what are you gonna do?
What do you think we're gonna do?
Don't say "we"! - I'll not consent to a thing like this.
I'm not consulting you.
There's only one thing to do with the guy.
But, Kovac, it's... it's murder!
It's execution!
No, we can't! We mustn't!
There must be some other way.
Why can't we tie him up, keep a watch on him?
Let him have it, Kovac!
Right now!
I'm not defending the man.
But why can't we wait till it's night? Then, in the morning —
What are you so squeamish about? We're at war!
You've seen 'em killed, haven't you?
In battle, yes! But not in cold blood like this!
Look out!
Stanley!
You fools! Stop thinking of yourselves!
Think of the boat!
Joe, take the sheet! Make it fast!
Kovac, man the pump!
The rest of you bail!
What do you know? We got a führer!
Never mind about that baggage! Start bailing!
You speak English!
Of course I speak English!
Can we stay afloat?
Those buoyancy tanks'll hold us up.
My suitcase!
Get that, somebody!
Rittenhouse!
Lash down that food!
There go our rations.
There goes our water supply.
Look out!
We might as well go down together, eh, Connie?
How am I doin', Willi?
Fine, Ritt! Fine!
You're a born accompanist.
You didn't make a single mistake, hardly.
Yeah, I know what you mean.
Right in here. Yeah, that's it.
Ritt, you're a born accompanist.
We're all born accompanists.
How'd I do, Willi?"
What are you laughing at, you silly goon?
That's one for the book...
your book.
Only, when you write it, they won't believe it.
Our enemy... our prisoner of war.
Now, we're his prisoners, and he's gauleiter of the boat, singin' German lullabies to us while he rows us to his supply ship and a concentration camp.
Tell 'em, Willi! Tell 'em how funny it is.
That isn't funny. It's logical.
Now that we've been blown off our course, it would take us weeks to get to Bermuda.
Certainly. It's perfectly logical. The supply ship was our only chance.
You know how I feel about that. I'd rather take my chances with the sharks.
But he'll never make it.
Without food and water, how long do you think he can keep on rowing like this?
Long enough, Mr Kovac, to reach my objective.
Are you sure, Willi?
Maybe one of us should had better try to relieve him at the oars.
That's not necessary.
Maybe I can take over for a while.
Never mind, I'll row.
How can you keep on rowing, Willi, hour after hour?
The rest of us can hardly lift an oar.
It's the master race. The Herrenvolk!
Didn't you know, they can do anything?
I'm beginning to believe it.
Right living is what does it.
Or, as the French say, "Qui tôt se couche bien se porte."
You speak French, also!
Yes, I spent some time in Paris.
Oh, yes.
Tell me, Willi. Why didn't you speak English when you first got on the boat?
Well, you see, I didn't know then whether I could trust you or not.
Wie geht's, Herr Schmidt?
Name is Smith!
All right, Mr Smith.
How do you feel today?
Same as yesterday.
Thirsty!
Well, steward, anything from the commissary yet?
Not even a nibble.
Well, keep on trying.
If you catch some fish, you'll not only have food, but drink.
When you chew raw fish, there's always a little fresh water.
Water.
There's that cloud.
What a day for a ball game.
St. Louis's the team to watch this year.
If we only had some bait.
St. Louis's got hitters. - It's been there all day.
Stan Musial's been cloutin' 'em out.
How about Ty Cobb?
He's pretty good too.
Got some A-1 pitchers.
Yeah. If the Dodgers only had a guy like Ernie Bonham, or even Johnnie Humphries.
Pittsburgh's the team to watch.
Only 17 points below St. Louis.
If we beat the Pirates and St. Louis loses to Boston...
Hey, Kovac.
Yeah?
Who do you think'll pitch for Pittsburgh today?
I don't know! I haven't been following the games much this season.
Probably Wyatt for the Dodgers, Sewell for the Pirates.
Yeah. Probably Sewell, Gus.
I think, I'll take Rosie.
Where to, Gus?
Ebbets Field.
It's gonna be a good game this afternoon.
Ritt!
He's off the beam again.
Well, Willi, how about another song, eh?
Certainly, my friend.
What would you like to hear?
You think you can remember "Röslein auf der Heide"?
Sure, sure! Which one was that?
Oh, yeah! I know that one, all right! Now, wait a minute!
All right!
I got it!
Ritt?
Huh?
Do you know "Treue Liebe"?
You mean, uh, "How can I leave..."
That's right.
Sure!
Stanley, why do you like to do that?
I don't know.
I can't sing anymore. Makes me dry.
Doesn't it look to you as if those clouds are darkening up?
At the centre, a bit.
Those really are rain clouds this time.
I hope so. For Gus's sake.
That's right.
Why don't you give me a break, Lu?
The salt'll only make you thirstier.
You might just as well sip poison.
B.M." Her initials are larger than the others.
Was she the last...
or the first?
What was her name?
So you won't talk, huh?
Where'd you get the handcuff, Mrs Porter?
You may call me Connie.
You did once during the storm, remember?
You said, uh...
We might as well go down together, eh, Connie?"
I liked the way you said "Connie".
It was like a sock in the jaw.
Tell me about the bracelet.
That was a dead giveaway, you know, darling, wanting us to die together like that.
Dying together is even more personal than living together.
What'd you pay for the bracelet?
Barter?
You're a low person, darling, obviously out of the gutter.
Maybe that's why I'm attracted to you.
Maybe that's why you're attracted to me.
Quit slumming.
Funny part of it is, I'm from the same gutter.
Remember when you first got on the boat, you said, you used to work in the, uh — the packing house section in Chicago?
Well, I came from there too.
South Side?
Ashland Avenue... back of the yards.
And I lived there until I got this.
It worked miracles for me.
It took me from the, uh...
South Side to the North Side.
It was my passport... from the stockyards to the Gold Coast.
It got me everything I wanted...
up to now.
Quit slumming!
How about a few hands, Ritt?
Huh? Suits me fine.
Do this up for me.
Connie, I'll fix it for you.
Come on, Ritt.
Kovac, how much do I owe you?
Twelve thousand bucks.
Merely temporary, my friend. I'll get it back.
Deal 'em.
Looks like bits of ice.
I wish they were.
They're really nothing but a few pieces of carbon, crystallized under high pressure at great heat.
Quite so, if you want to be scientific about it.
I'm a great believer in science.
Like tears, for instance.
They're nothing but H2O with a trace of sodium chloride.
He likes you, but he hates the bracelet.
You will have to get rid of it.
The bracelet? - Mm-hmm.
I've worn it for 15 years. It's brought me nothing but good luck.
He hates it.
I wouldn't take it off for anything or anybody in the world.
In the old days there was a place in Boston, Young's Hotel.
Had the best restaurant in the world.
Bet it wasn't any better than Henrici's Coffee House in Chicago.
Or Bookbinder's in Philly... that was food for you.
There, it's fixed!
In Munich, there is a place called Lorber's.
Their specialty is pot roast.
Young's used to have a menu, 150 pages long.
Yes, sir, 150 solid pages of eatments, and, oh, boy, what eatments!
Ever eat in Antoine's in New Orleans?
Can't compare with Young's.
You never tasted such food in your life.
Especially seafood.
Steamed clams dripping with melted butter, lobsters...
lobsters à la Newburg with a special white wine sauce...
Ritt, shut up!
What's wrong?
Stop jabbering about food!
Isn't it enough we've lost all our supplies through your carelessness?
Carelessness?
Yes, stupid, criminal carelessness!
But it wasn't me. I wasn't in charge of the food.
The commissary was Joe's job.
You dirty rat, trying to shift the blame onto Joe.
Maybe it was my f—
No, it wasn't!
You should have seen the storm coming!
My dear Connie, what's the matter with you?
She's all right. Just a little bit hungry.
What are you squawking about?
It'll make a swell chapter.
How It Feels to Be Starving", first-person, singular.
Those are good things to write about, hunger and thirst.
If you really come from back of the yard...
Kovac, why don't you kill Willi?
Why don't you cut his throat, like you said you would?
I'll tell you why! You're not strong enough!
The rest of us are just flesh and blood... hungry flesh and blood, and thirsty!
For the love of Mike, will you throw that ratty cigar stub away?
Why should I? Does it annoy you?
Yes, it makes me nervous, watching you chew on it all the time.
Well, it makes me feel good.
Oh, you feel good, do you?
That's fine. Fine!
Ritt, how much money are you worth?
Enough to buy and sell you a million times!
How about raising the ante?
Anything you say.
From now on, each stick is $100.
Anything you say.
Deal 'em!
Anything you...
How many factories do you own, Ritt?
What business is that of yours?
I was just thinking. By the time we get home, I might own one of them.
Bet a hundred.
Raise a hundred.
Stay.
How many cards do you want?
Three.
Three to you. Three to the dealer.
Think I'll go for one of your airplane plants.
I've got ideas of my own about how to run a factory.
Yeah, into the ground.
I'll have a labour-management committee. We'll hold a meeting every week.
And first — Are you trying to tell me how to run my own factories?
Not all of them, just the one I'm gonna own.
Bet a hundred.
I'll see you! Queens.
Kings.
You know, it's mighty funny how you keep winning all the pots.
I'm a lucky guy.
Well, just the same, I wish we had a new deck of cards.
Give me another stack of chips.
That's another thousand.
Sorry, Ritt.
Cut you in?
My credit still good?
Well, uh, your bracelet.
No, thanks.
What's the score?
$13,500!
How about raising the ante?
It's your funeral.
Thousand dollars apiece?
Okay.
I'll open for a thousand.
Raise you two.
I'll raise you two.
Call.
How many?
Two cards.
Someday you'll learn, it doesn't pay to hold a kicker if you live long enough.
Just to keep the pikers out.
I'll bet five.
Matched your kicker, huh?
Five's the bet.
Put up... or shut up.
And raise you five.
Kovac, now you're talking my language.
This is the moment I've been waiting for.
I have got you over a barrel... we'll do the bookkeeping later.
I'll see your five, and I'll raise you... all the chips you've got, plus all the money I owe you.
Kovac, looks as if you've stepped out of your class this time.
See you, Rittenhouse. What have you got?
I've got...
That was my pot. You couldn't possibly beat me.
I have a full house.
And I had four deuces.
How do I know you had four deuces?
You ought to know.
You made the cards, didn't you?
And you marked 'em too!
They are crooked, and you are crooked!
It's raining!
It's raining!
It's raining!
Get the sail!
I was at the wheel when she hit.
My watch was just about over... and I was goin' down for some hot java.
When she keeled over.
the siren was screamin'.
Like a human being, she was screamin'.
Right to the end.
Oh, you should've heard the sound of the rain drumming' on the canvas.
Most beautiful sound you ever heard in your life.
I looked up.
A couple of drops fell right on my lips.
Hey, Joe!
What's the matter?
Why have you stopped playin'?
Come on!
Heat it up!
Give it the Harry James!
Gee, Rosie!
You're an armful.
An armful of honey, that's what you are.
Say, Rosie, I'm thirsty.
How about a drink?
Set 'em up, Pete!
Nice tall ones.
Plenty of ice.
Here's to you, Rosie baby.
What is it, Gus?
Willi's got some water.
That's right, Gus.
I just had a tall one, plenty of ice.
Sure, Gus! Sure!
But Willi only had water.
That's right.
Uh, I guess, I'll get back to Rosie.
Willi, where'd you get the water?
You've been holdin' out on us.
You mustn't wake up the others.
They are tired.
Well, what about you?
Ain't you tired?
Me neither.
I feel fine, except my right foot's asleep.
I can hardly feel it.
Willi, tell me.
Do you think I should write to Rosie, tell her about it?
Or should I wait till I see her?
Wait till you see her.
Yeah, but...
I can't walk in on her gimpy and all like this without no... warning, can I?
I got to find some way to... to break it to her gentle.
It'll be all right.
Okay.
So long, Willi.
Good-bye, Gus.
I'll never forget what you done for me.
If there's anything I can ever do for you, just let me know.
There is something you can do for me.
Remember, your name is Schmidt.
You like it better than Smith?
Much better!
You'd better hurry, Gus! She's waiting.
Okay.
That water you was drinkin'...
Rosie's waiting for you.
Why didn't you share it with us?
You mustn't wake them!
Okay, Willi.
Why don't you go after Rosie?
She's waiting for you at Roseland!
There! Do you see the lights?
Help!
Stanley!
Help!
Stanley?
Stanley!
Willi, he's got...
Help!
Where's Gus?
He's gone over.
No use, Stan...
Gus!
He went under.
Willi, what is it? What's happened?
Schmidt went over the side.
He was calling my name. That's what woke me.
You can't imagine how painful it was to me.
All night long, to watch him turning and suffering and nothing I could do for him.
Why didn't you stop rowing?
Why should I?
To help him!
The best way to help him was to let him go.
I had no right to stop him, even if I wanted to.
A poor cripple dying of hunger and thirst...
What good could life be to a man like that?
He was trying to tell me something. If I could only remember!
He's better off now, out of his trouble.
Something about water.
He was in agony from thirst.
I wanted to cry, but the tears wouldn't come.
No, how could they?
If I remember rightly, tears are water with a trace of sodium chloride.
Isn't that so, Willi?
Ja.
What about sweat?
What's the chemical composition of sweat?
Water... with a trace of something or other.
Now, I remember!
Gus said, Willi had some water!
Yeah! Right under his shirt!
Quite so.
I took the precaution of filling the flask from the water breakers before the storm, just in case of emergency.
And I had food tablets and energy pills too.
Everybody on the U-boat has them.
You should be grateful to me for having the foresight to think ahead.
To survive, one must have a plan.
But there's nothing to worry about.
Soon we'll reach the supply ship, and then we'll all have food and water.
Too bad Schmidt couldn't have waited.
You!
Please, don't... Please, Miss Alice!
To my dying day, I'll never understand Willi.
Or what he did.
First, he tried to kill us all with his torpedoes.
Nevertheless, we fished him out of the sea, took him aboard, shared everything we had with him.
You would've thought, he'd have been grateful.
All he could do was to plot against us.
Then he...
He let poor old Gus die of thirst.
What do you do with people like that?
Maybe one of us ought to try to row.
Where to?
What for?
Nah!
When we killed the German, we killed our motor.
No!
We still got a motor.
Eh?
Who?
Nah!
We're through.
Are you afraid?
No. I don't think so.
If we had got out of it, I...
I was going to ask you to marry me.
What do you think you'd have said?
I think I would've said, yes.
Well, then, whatever happens...
I'd like you to marry me.
Congratulations!
Well, that's settled.
And what now, little men?
I've been a widower for 18 years.
We never had any children.
All I leave behind me is a great many millions of dollars.
I hope they do somebody some good.
So, we're all going to fold up and die, just because that ersatz superman is gone.
My only regret is that in the end
I joined a mob.
Baloney!
We weren't a mob when we killed him.
We were a mob when we sat around, prisoners of the man we'd saved, kowtowing to him, obeying him, practically heiling him, because he was kind enough and strong enough to take us to a concentration camp!
Good grief, look at you!
Rittenhouse, C. J. Rittenhouse, self-made man.
Made of what?
As long as you're sitting there, thinking of your last will and testament,
I'll write your epitaph for you now.
Ritt, he quit!"
That goes for you too, Narcissus!
It's a good thing there's room on your chest for another letter..."Q" for quitter!
And you, Joe...
It's all right for you to look up and trust in somebody.
How about giving him a hand?
What's the matter with us?
We not only let the Nazi do our rowing for us, but our thinking!
Ye Gods and little fishes!
Fishes!
Ye Gods!
We haven't got energy pills, but the ocean's full of them.
Well, why don't we catch some?
We tried that! We have no bait!
Sure, we have bait: by Cartier!
Are you kidding?
Kidding, my foot!
Well, what are you waiting around for?
Where's the fish line?
Bait your line, chum.
Not only food, but oil.
We can squeeze the fish for oil. It's better than water.
I can recommend the bait. I ought to know. I bit on it myself!
I've never eaten raw fish before.
I have. It's not bad.
We'd better not count our chickens before they're hatched.
What do you mean, "chickens"?
There never yet was a poor fish that wouldn't bite on one of those.
Strike!
It's a good one!
Careful!
Easy!
Easy does it!
Don't let him have slack!
There's a ship.
Gangway!
Why, you...
My bracelet!
It's the supply ship, all right.
Yeah!
Willi's had the last word at that.
Well, some of my best friends are in concentration camps.
Do you suppose they'll have any coffee aboard?
Real coffee?
Hello!
What'd he say?
He says, yes, they have some coffee.
And Wiener schnitzel and pig's knuckles and sauerkraut and apple strudel — hot!
Look! The supply ship's signalling.
What's happening?
Why are they turning around?
Maybe they forgot the cream for the coffee.
They're not going to pick us up!
Hey!
Well, that's... that's impossible.
They can't leave us here like this. Why... Why, that's inhuman.
As a matter of fact, it's a violation of international law.
And now, there's a storm coming up.
No, that's gunfire.
I think it would be a good idea to get out of here.
Do you know I...
You know, I believe that we're being shelled by our own side.
They're shooting at us! What's the matter with them? Can't they see us?
Why can't we signal 'em or something?
With what?
Where are we going?
What's the best place to go?
She's moving towards us. Hurry up, Kovac!
Can't you boys row any faster?
In a word, wow!
Relax, Mr Rittenhouse!
They've got her!
Watch your head!
She's going down.
And fast too!
Not fast enough for me!
Well, that settles the score.
Here comes our ship. She ought to be here in about 20 minutes.
What can we use to signal with?
Wait'll she gets a little nearer.
Well, folks, we're in business agai...
There I go again.
Well, I only hope Mrs Spencer hasn't been worrying too much.
Who's Mrs Spencer?
My wife.
George, you're married?
Those things happen to everybody, you know.
Twenty minutes?
Good heavens. My nails, my hair, my face!
Oh, I must look a fright!
Oh, here, darling.
No, darling!
You first.
Yes, darling! Yes!
'Cause one of my best friends is in the navy.
Hmm, nice! Mighty nice!
The boy goes to high school!
Really?
What's his name?
George. - Oh.
George Charles Spencer.
Lovely family, George!
Lovely family! - Oh, thanks!
Stanley, do you realize, I don't even know your last name?
G
A-, double R-, E-, double T.
Garrett!" Garrett!
Am I presentable, darling? How do I look?
A million!
Fifty grand.
Kovac, my boy, I owe you fifty grand.
Forget that last hand, Ritt.
I will never forget that last hand.
Don't be silly, darling!
He'll find a way to take it off his income tax.
Not at all!
Not at all! - And don't forget.
You owe me a bracelet.
Yows'm!
And a typewriter!
Sure! - And a camera!
You bet!
And...
Danke schön.
It's his arm. Let's get his coat off!
Hey, wait a minute!
Have you forgotten about Willi already?
Ritt, this is different! The kid's wounded.
Throw him back!
Don't be silly, darling. He's... He's helpless.
The baby has a toy.
I should've frisked him.
You see?
You can't treat them as human beings. You've got to exterminate them!
Easy, Ritt!
He'll be taken care of.
He says, "Aren't you going to kill me?"
I'll have to tie this up till the ship's doctor takes care of it.
Aren't you going to kill me?"
What are you gonna do with people like that?
I don't know.
I was thinking of Mrs Higley and her baby.
And Gus.
Well, maybe they can answer that.
We're three happy chappies with snappy serapes
You'll find us beneath our sombreros
We're brave and we'll stay so We're bright as a peso
Who says so, we say so We're Three Caballeros
Oh, through fair
Or stormy weather
We're always together
So let come what may
Like brother to brother we're all for each other
The Three Caballeros
Forever we'll stay
Oh!
Felicitations to Donald Duck... on his birthday, Friday the 13th... from his friends in Latin America."
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy!
What a pleasant surprise. Whoops.
Ah, now, isn't that wonderful? Which one should I open first?
My mama told me to take... this one!
Oh, boy!
Home movies! Just what I wanted.
Well, well, well. Well, doggone. A little penguin.
Oh. What a cute little fella.
Well, what is this? How do you open this thing, anyway?
On with the show.
The show must go on.
Sí, señor. That means "strange birds."
Oh, sure, sure.
I know: Birds.
Yes, amigo, your feathered cousins.
You know, Donald, you have more relatives here... than there are coffee beans in Brazil.
For instance, take the one who lives way, way down...
But suppose we let my friend Professor Holloway tell us about it.
From the beginning to...
El fin, the end.
Yes. Thank you.
Professor?
This story takes us way down to the South Pole.
Rather than have you stand on your heads... let's turn the theater over.
There. That's better.
Two things you will find most of down here... are ice and penguins.
It's amazing that anybody would want to live here... but most penguins wouldn't live anywhere else.
You couldn't find better weather for fishing... skiing, tobogganing... or swimming.
And there is nothing the average penguin likes better... than a day at the beach.
Uh, but come on.
Let's meet Pablo.
He lives down at the end of Main Street.
Let's go in and see what's cookin'.
Pablo could never remember having been warm enough... and so his closest companion was SmokeyJoe... his little stove.
Between chills, Pablo had one burning desire... to spend the rest of his life on some tropical shore.
So we see him bravely set forth for the isle of his dreams.
The other penguins turned out to give him a big send-off.
But when he gets just so far away from his stove...
See what happens?
Too bad.
Perhaps he'll give up this wild idea.
But no. He's off to another start.
This time he's bringing a friend.
Anyway, it was a hot idea.
Well, maybe he'll be content to stay at home this time.
But no!
There he goes... hotfooting it to the land of the sun.
By now, the farewell committee has been reduced to two.
Discouraging, isn't it?
Suddenly, Pablo got one of those ideas... that change a person's whole life:
A boat.
But where would he get a boat?
Just watch.
Where there's a will, there's a way, they say.
And now, the official launching.
Day after day, the south wind carried him north.
One day, a blanket of fog rolled in... and it was so thick...
Must be near Cape Horn.
As the fog lifted... he found himself headed straight through the Straits of Magellan... and northward along Chile's rocky coast.
One day, a storm cloud came up... just a little bitty old storm cloud, though... and just tried awful hard to have its first storm.
Didn't amount to much, though.
One day on lookout, Pablo had a bit of a shock... a waterspout off the port bow!
But it proved to be theJuan Fernandez Islands... where Robinson Crusoe once lived... and still does, apparently.
Four bells and all's well.
According to Pablo's chart, he should be nearing Vina Del Mar.
And strangely enough, that's just where he is.
He sailed past Lima, capital of Peru... hugging the coastline with a tenacity of purpose... seldom found in a penguin.
One day his telescope picked out a city... high up on top of a mountain.
The map said it was Quito... and it was right smack on the equator.
It wasn't as easy to cross... but with a little help from Neptune, he made it.
So, making a left turn, he followed the equator... headed for the Galapagos Islands.
Ah, that good old sun.
Pablo felt that he'd never get enough of it.
Oh, he hadn't counted on this.
Things looked pretty bad.
Help! Man the pumps!
She's sprung a leak!
Pipe all hands on deck! Do things! Get going!
Take to the lifeboats! Abandon ship!
Unruffle the mizzenmast and man the poops!
And, well, don't just stand there. Get going!
Swab the decks, and...
Look!
What's that?
Just what he's been looking for.
Pablo has finally reached the isle of his dreams.
And so, as the warm tropical sun... sinks slowly in the west... we leave little Pablo, a bird in paradise... a picture of health in his new coat of tan.
He should be the happiest penguin in the world.
Only sometimes... he gets to thinking...
Never satisfied.
Well, that's human nature for you... even if you're a penguin.
You're absolutely right.
And now, Donald, let's hop over the Andes.
From these snowcapped peaks to the depths of the Amazon jungle... one finds many more strange and exotic birds.
Like the anambepreto of Colombia and Venezuela.
He carries his own bagpipes hidden under his beard.
Then there's his cousin, the arapapa... pride of Paraguay, whose perfect appearance... permits his pompous pride in his pompadour.
And la tijereta, the scissors bird... the Colombian cutup.
Then there's the arapacu de pico curvo.
He's always sticking his nose into things.
Did you ever see such a freak beak, huh?
Speaking of beaks, what a time two toucans have making love.
When they're beak to beak, they can't get cheek to cheek.
Because when one toucan turns his head... only one toucan can.
Eh, glad to know ya. Pleased to meet ya.
Now, he's called the aracuan... because of the peculiar song he sings... which sounds something like this.
By the way, amigo, did you know some birds are skilled craftsmen?
Uh-uh. Is that so?
Yes. Quite a builder is the little marrequito.
His nest may look haphazard in design... ah, but every single stick and straw... is scientifically placed to withstand... the stress and strain of... well, almost anything.
Literally dotted are the shores of many tropical marshes... with the brilliant plumage of the flamingo.
And now, Donald, how would you like to hear a story... about another bird so amazing you won't believe it?
Oh, sure. You bet.
It's a tale told by an old gaucho from Uruguay.
Listen.
It was early one morning in springtime... just as day was beginning to break.
As the sun came up over the...
Oh, but I am forgetting my story.
It was silent out there on the pampas. Only one little bird was awake.
From his nest came the little hornero to see if the...
Oh, say, do you know why this bird's called the hornero?
No?
Uh-uh. Why?
You see, his nest is just like the horno.
That's the oven where we bake our bread and our...
Oh, oh, oh, you know who that is?
That's me, when I was a little gauchito.
Many, many years ago, of course.
And why was I up so early?
Because I was going out hunting all alone.
First I put on my bombachas and tied on my chiripá.
Then I slipped into my new botas.
And I put my boleadoras where I could reach them in a hurry.
¡Gauchito.!
Not forgetting my hunting knife.
And now I was ready to go.
Now, the best place to hunt the wild ostrich... is out on the wide open plains... on the broad, flat land of the...
Flat land?
Say, what am I doing here?
Oh, now I remember.
This day I was hunting for condor birds high up in the mountains.
While looking around for the condors, I climbed to the top of a rock.
No, come to think of it, it was a tree.
Let's see, maybe it was a rock after all.
Although I could swear it was a tree.
Oh, what's the difference?
Let it go. Let it go.
My sharp eyes soon discovered the nest of a...
Psst! ¡Gauchito.!
The nest.
I could tell from the wings he was... he was a least five meters from tip to tip.
The biggest condor bird in all of... ¡Caramba.!
What's this? I couldn't believe my eyes.
No, it couldn't be. But there it was.
I was looking face to face with a flying donkey.
The donkey bird didn't seem bashful.
He flew right up close to...
Quick, Gauchito.!
Now!
Get him, quick!
Aha.
Now, now. Easy, easy.
This donkey should be worth a fortune.
I couldn't let him get away.
So I made up my mind that I'd catch him if it took me the rest of...
Now I had him! Hold him, Gauchito.!
Ride him, cowboy!
He acted just like he was loco, but I was an expert, of course.
He thought he could throw this gauchito... but he soon found out who was the boss.
Psst, Gauchito.!
Who is the boss?
I decided to train him for racing... far out where nobody could see... 'cause I planned to win thousands of pesos... for this little burrito and me.
I made brilliant plans for the future.
We'd live like a couple of kings... and I'd be the world's richest gaucho... with my hands full of big diamond rings.
¡Ah, macanudo.! Okay.
This burrito was tame as a kitten.
He was learning new tricks every day.
You should see how he begged for my mate.
He liked it much better than hay.
Then we soon fell asleep by the campfire.
We both were as tired as could be... and tomorrow was very important... for little Burrito and me.
For this was the day of fiesta.
The gauchos were happy and gay.
They danced the zamba and gatos... and gambled their pesos away.
While the crowd sang and danced in the plaza...
I just stood in the shade of a tree... and watched them toss coins at the sapo.
But this game meant nothing to me.
Some others were rolling the bochas and betting on games of this kind.
But I didn't join in these pastimes.
¡Ay, caballo.!
The race was about to begin... and the grand prize was 1,000 pesos.
The gauchos were howling with laughter... when they saw us come out on the track.
I whispered, "Remember the wings, Burrito."
Oh-oh-oh-oh!
The gauchos and horses were all on their toes.
We flew down the track like the wind.
Every gaucho was, uh, uh...
Meanwhile, Burrito and I were, uh, uh, jockeying for position. ¡Gauchito.!
They went that way.
No wonder they laughed. I didn't even look like a jockey.
Hey, Gauchito.
Come on. Look like a jockey.
Pepito, the pride of Mendoza, was setting a furious pace... and Fuego, Gordito and Pingo, you never have seen such a race.
Now it's Pepito and Fuego.
It's Fuego and Pepito. And there comes Gordito on the rail.
Do your stuff, kid. No?
Well, don't wait too long or...
Look out!
What did I tell you?
Come on, Gauchito. The wings, the wings.
Quickly I untied the rope.
Come on, come on.
Quickly I untied the rope.
The knife!
And now we go.
You should see little Burrito... tearing up the track, so fast you couldn't see us.
And now down the home stretch comes Fuego.
Now Pepito's ahead on the rail.
Here comes Pingo, Gordito and Gato, and Dorado is right on his tail.
But where is Burrito?
Here comes Burrito!
We passed them like they were standing still.
And now coming down across the line of finish, it's Burrito, the winner!
Well, amigos, it was all over but the shouting...
I thought.
Caramba. The jig was up.
And what became of the flying donkey, you ask?
Neither him nor me was ever seen again... as long as we lived.
Adios, amigo.
Adios. So long!
What's going on here?
Presents!
Oh, boy! Let me at 'em!
Say, what's this?
Or, as you Americans say, what's cookin'?
Joe Carioca! Well, I'll be doggoned!
Imagine meeting me here.
Donald, have you ever been to Baía? No?
No, I haven't.
Ah, Baía.
Land of romance... moonlight, music, beautiful girls.
Oh, forgive the interruption, Donald.
This crazy bird is the aracuan.
He's meio maluco, a very stupid fellow.
But tell me, Donald, have you ever been to Baía?
No, I haven't.
No? Oh...
I am so sorry for you.
Ah, Baía.
It is like a song in my heart.
A song with love... and beautiful memories.
I close my eyes, and I can see it now.
I can see the beautiful twilight in the sky.
I can feel the breeze from the bay... and I can hear the music, the music of Baía.
When twilight is deep in the sky
Someone that I long to see
Keeps haunting my reverie
And so the loneliness deep in my heart Calls to you
Calls to you
I live in the memory of
Many dreams ago
When the stars were bright
And you were mine alone
My love for you cannot die
Though the oceans run dry
Or heaven falls from the sky
Now you're gone
Can't you hear my lonely call
Make my life complete again
How I pray for the day
When I'll see your smile
And my heart will beat again
When twilight is deep in the sky
Someone that I long to see
Keeps haunting my reverie
And so the loneliness deep in my heart
Calls to you, calls to you
Ah, Baía.
Beautiful Baía.
Oh, forgive me, but have you been to Baía, Donald?
No. -No?
Well, let's go.
If you go to Baía, my friend... you'll never return.
Have you been to Baía, Donald
Uh-uh. -Well, let's go
They have vatapá
What's that?
They have caruru
Is that so?
They have munguzá
Munguzá?
Do you like to samba
Oh, sure.
Have you been to Baía, Donald
No.
Well, let's go
When you go to Baía, my friend
You'll never return
Have you been to Baía?
No. -No?
Well, let's go!
Hurry, Donald!
Well, well. Here we are in Baía, land of romance.
Baía?
Where is Baía?
We are in Baía.
Look.
Well, I'll be doggoned.
Who's that?
Donald, that's Yayá.
Who's Yayá?
Donald, quindins de Yayá.
She sells cookies. Cookies, my friend.
Donald!
Hello. -i Como vai!
Hi, toots.
Who is that guy?
Oh, he's a malandro, Donald.
This Donald!
Did you ever see such a fast worker?
No, no, Donald.
Take it easy.
Look.
Come on, boys.
What do you feel about Baía, huh?
Tell me the truth.
Oh, swell! Marvelous!
Romance.
Moonlight.
Beautiful girls.
Or as you say, you are a wolf.
Take it easy. You have more presents.
Presents?
Presents!
Oh, I'm a midget!
You, you're a midget too!
Oh-ho, Donald! Don't worry.
It is simple, my friend.
Just a little black magic will fix you up.
Believe it or not, it is very simple!
You are very funny fellow!
You kill my head!
Oh, my friend... you are using the wrong finger.
Now, blow!
Thanks, pal!
B-B-B-But, Donald, your presents!
My presents!
Aha, my friends!
Welcome to Mexico.
Son of a gun, it's a pleasure to see such fine gentlemen in Mexico.
Here, amigos. Donald!
José.
Now we're three gay caballeros.
We're three caballeros Three gay caballeros
They say we are birds of a feather
We're happy amigos No matter where he goes
The one, two and three goes We're always together
We're three happy chappies with snappy serapes
You'll find us beneath our sombreros
We're brave and we'll stay so We're bright as a peso -Who says so?
We say so
The Three Caballeros
We have the stars to guide us
Guitars here beside us
To play as we go
We sing and we samba We shout, Ay, caramba
What means "ay, caramba"?
Oh, yes. I don't know.
Through fair or stormy weather
We stand close together
Like books on a shelf
And pals though we may be
When some Latin baby says yes, no, or maybe Each man is for himself
What's this? -What's this?
This is your gift from Mexico, Donald: A piñata.
Oh, boy, oh, boy!
What's a piñata?
A piñata is full of surprises, presents.
It is the very spirit of Christmas. Christmas?
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all...
No, no, Donald. For goodness sake.
Not "Jingly Bells."
In Mexico, they sing "Las Posadas."
This custom takes place on each of the nine days before Christmas.
Each evening, the children gather at the village church... and form a procession symbolizing the journey of Mary and Joseph... from Nazareth to Bethlehem.
The little ones carry images of the saints from house to house... singing a plea for shelter, or posada.
A reply comes from within:
No posada. No shelter."
Looking sad and downhearted, they try again... but the reply is still the same.
No shelter. No posada."
They repeat this song time after time... and always they are refused.
Until at last they reach a friendly house and the door is opened.
Come in, come in, holy pilgrims.
This humble home is yours."
And now, Mary and Joseph have found shelter at last.
Then the rejoicing begins... the feasting, the celebrating... and finally the biggest surprise of all:
Breaking the piñata.
And now for your piñata, Donald. Here you are.
Go to it. One side, boys.
One side. I'm gonna smack it! Uh-uh, no, hold it.
Ho-Hold it, Donald. First you must be blindfolded.
We have to put this over your eyes.
That's part of the tradition.
Now, now, now, stand here.
Come here now.
Hit it hard.
All right, let's see you smack it.
You see, Donald?
Didn't I told you it was full of surprises?
Did you know that the history of Mexico is in her flag? Oh, yes!
You see, many hundreds of years ago, the god of the Aztecs... commanded them to build a big city where they would find
But when they find this eagle, he was sitting on a cactus on top of a rock... way out in the middle of a lake.
To build a city here would be almost imposible.
But they built and built and built some more... until today, believe it or not, the lake is full of Mexico City.
Sweet music
Gay serenatas
Tropic skies Of velvet blue
Magic gardens

Ah, but this is only the beginning, amigos.
Take a look at this one. Oh, boy!

And this, Donald, is Patzcuaro... a fisherman's paradise.
Beautiful! Oh, boy!
Would I like to come back sometime... and do a little fishing.
What's going on here? -Shh!
This is my favorite dance, the "jarabe pateño."
Doggone it! I can't get it.
No-no-no-no-no-no-no, boys! You are off the beat.
This is the way.
Well, what do you know?
I had a wonderful time.
So long!
This is the way they dance in Veracruz.
It's called the "lilongo."
Hi, girls!
May I cut in?
Watch your step, Donald!
Some fun, hey, kid?
So you like dancing, huh? -Okay. -Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Go on, Donald. Don't be afraid.
Not so fast, boys. Go on in, Donald.
Don't be bashful.
Hi, toots! Am I intruding?
Hey, Donald, you are what they say, off the cob!
You know, corny.
Oh, yeah?
Swing me with that boogie beat, Joe!
How am I doin', toots?
Come on, let me down.
I wanna stay!
Take it easy, Donald.
There she is...
Take the telescope and have a look at what you might call the hot stuff.
Am I going to like this place.
Oh, boy!
I'll be right down, toots.
Hello, my sweet little bathing beauties.
We're three caballeros Three gay caballeros They say we are birds of a feather
Where's Donald?
Look at the little wolf in duck's clothings.
Come to Papa.
Wha-What's going on here?
Come here, you little rascals.
Now I've got ya. Uh-oh.
Doggone this confusion!
Where is she?
Come here, my little enchilada.
I've got you this time, tootsie.
Peek-a-boo.
My, my, my!
Ain't this fun?
Here I come!
This time I'm gonna get you!
Oh, no, no, no, Donald! Don't do that!
Let me go.
Get me outta here!
You can't do this to me.
Get your hands off of me!
This is a free country.
So you like pretty girls, huh?
Let's go!
Don't ruffle your feathers, Donald!
Look, I will show you the nightlife of Mexico City.
Beautiful, no? -Colossal!
Oh, boy!
Mexico City?
Very beautiful city.
Careful, Donald.
Even the sky is full of romantic!
You belong to my heart -She's beautiful!
Now and forever
And our love had its start -Oh, boy!
Not long ago
We were gathering stars
While a million guitars played our love song
When I said "I love you" every beat of my heart
Oh, boy, oh, boy. -Said it too
'Twas a moment like this
Do you remember
And your eyes threw a kiss
When they met mine
Now we own all the stars
And a million guitars are still playing
Darling, you are the song
And you'll always belong to my heart
'Twas a moment like this
Do you remember -Uh-huh.
And your eyes threw a kiss
When they met mine
Don't do that!
Now we own all the stars
And a million guitars are still playing Darling, you are the song
And you'll always belong to my heart
You belong To my heart
Now and forever
Three caballeros Three gay caballeros Three caballeros Three gay caballeros
When I said "I love you"
Every beat of my heart said it too
Some fun, hey, kid?
Some fun, hey, kid?

We're three caballeros Three gay caballeros
They say we are birds of a feather
We're happy amigos No matter where he goes

Oh, through fair or stormy weather
We're always together
So let come what may
Like brother to brother we're all for each other
The Three Caballeros
Forever we'll Stay
Evening, Mr. Godby.
Hello, hello, hello.
Quite the stranger, aren't you?
l couldn't get in yesterday.
l wondered what had happened to you.
l had a bit of a dustup.
What about?
Saw a chap getting out of a first-class compartment. When he came to give up his ticket, it was only third class.
I told him to pay the excess, and he turned nasty. - l had to send for Mr. Saunders.
Fat lot of good he'd be.
He ticked him off.
Seeing's believing.
I tell you, he ticked him off proper.
You pay the balance at once," he says, "or I'll hand you over to the police."
You ought to have seen the look on the chap's face at the mention of the word "police." Changed his tune then, he did. Paid up like lightning.
That's just what I mean. He didn't have the courage to handle it himself. - He had to call in the police.
Aw, he's not a bad lot, Mr. Saunders. After all, you can't expect much spirit from a man with only one lung and a wife with diabetes.
I thought something must be wrong when you didn't come.
I'd have popped in to explain, but I had a date and had to run for it the moment I went off.
Oh, indeed.
Chap I know is getting married.
Very interesting, I'm sure. - What's up with you, anyway?
l'm sure I don't know to what you're referring.
You're a bit unfriendly all of a sudden.
Beryl, hurry up.
Put some more coal in the stove while you're at it.
Yes, Mrs. Bagot.
I'm afraid I really can't stand here wasting my time in idle gossip, Mr. Godby.
Aren't you going to offer me another cup?
You can have another cup and welcome when you've finished that one.
Beryl'll give it to you. I've got my accounts to do.
I see. I'd rather you gave it to me.
Time and tide wait for no man, Mr. Godby.
Laura, what a lovely surprise!
Oh, Dolly.
My dear, I've been shopping till I'm dropping. My feet are nearly off, and my throat's parched.
I thought of having tea in Spindle's, but I was terrified of losing the train. - Oh, dear.
This is Dr. Harvey.
How do you do?
Would you be a perfect dear and get me my cup of tea?
I really don't think I could drag my poor old bones over to the counter.
No, please.
My dear, what a nice-looking man. Who on earth is he?
Really, you're quite a dark horse. I shall telephone Fred in the morning and make mischief.
This is a bit of luck. I haven't seen you for ages.
I've been meaning to pop in, you know, but Tony's had measles... and then I had all that awful fuss over Phyllis.
But, of course, you don't know. My dear, she left me.
Oh, how dreadful.
Mind you, I never really cared for her much, but still, Tony did. Tony adored her.
I'll tell you all about that later in the train. Thank you so very much.
There's certainly enough milk in it, but still, it'll be refreshing.
Oh, dear, no sugar.
lt's in the spoon.
Oh, of course. What a fool I am.
Laura, you're looking frightfully well. I do wish I'd known you were coming in today.
We could've come together and lunched and had a good gossip. I loathe shopping by myself anyway.
There's your train. - Yes, I know.
Oh, aren't you coming with us?
No, I go in the opposite direction. My practice is in Churley.
Oh, I see.
l'm a general practitioner at the moment.
Dr. Harvey's going out to Africa next week.
Oh, how thrilling.
...the 5:40 to Churley, Leigh Green and Langdon.
l must go.
Yes, you must.
Good-bye.
Good-bye.
He'll have to run, or he'll miss it. He's got to get right over to the other platform.
Talking of missing trains reminds me of that awful bridge at Broadham Junction.
You've got to go traipsing all up one side along the top and down the other.
Well, the other day, I'd been over to see Bob's solicitor about renewing the lease of the house.
And I arrived at the station with exactly half a minute to spare.
My dear, I flew. I'd got Tony with me... and like a fool, I just bought a new shade for the lamp in the drawing room.
I could've gotten it just as easily here in Milford. Well, it was the most enormous thing.
I could hardly see over it. I've never been in such a frizz in all my life. I nearly knocked a woman down.
Of course, by the time I got home, it was battered to bits.
Oh, is that our train?
Can you tell me, is that the Ketchworth train?
No, it's the express.
The boat train.
Oh, of course. That doesn't stop, does it?
I want some chocolate, please.
Milk or plain?
Plain, I think.
Or, no, perhaps milk would be nicer. Have you any with nuts in it?
Nestle's Nut Milk.
Shilling or sixpence? One plain and one nut milk.
Large or small?
Large, please.
Where is she?
I never noticed her go.
Oh, I couldn't think where you'd disappeared to.
I just wanted to see the express go through.
What on earth's the matter?
Are you feeling ill?
l feel a little sick.
My dear, come and sit down.
There's our train.
lt's all right.
Have you any brandy?
l'm afraid it's out of hours.
Oh, surely, if somebody's feeling ill - - l'm all right, really.
Just a sip of brandy will buck you up.
Please. - Very well.
Thank you.
How much? - Tenpence, please.
The train for Ketchworth is now arriving at platform three.
We shall have to hurry.
Oh, well, this is a bit of luck. This train's generally packed.
I really am very worried about you, dear. You look terribly peaky.
I'm all right. Really, I am. I just felt faint for a minute, that's all.
It often happens to me. I did it once in the middle of Bobby's school concert. I don't think he's ever forgiven me.
Well, he certainly was very good-looking.
Who?
Your friend, Doctor - whatever his name was.
Yes, he's a nice creature.
Have you known him long?
No, not very long.
I hardly know him at all, really.
Well, my dear, I've always had a passion for doctors.
I can well understand how it is that women get -
I wish I could trust you.
I wish you were a wise, kind friend... instead of a gossiping acquaintance I've known casually for years... and never particularly cared for.
I wish. I wish.
Fancy him going all the way to Africa. is he married?
Well, yes.
Any children?
Yes, two boys. He's very proud of them.
is he taking them with him - his wife and children, I mean?
Yes. Yes, he is.
I suppose it's sensible in a way rushing off... to start life anew in the wide open spaces and all that sort of thing, but... wild horses wouldn't drag me away from England... and home and all the things I'm used to.
I mean, one has one's roots after all, hasn't one?
Oh, yes, one has one's roots.
I knew a girl once years ago who went to Africa. Her husband was something to do with engineering or something.
And, my dear, she had the most dreadful time. She caught some awful kind of germ through going out on a picnic... and she was ill for months and months.
I wish you'd stop talking.
I wish you'd stop prying and trying to find things out.
I wish you were dead. No, I don't mean that. That was silly and unkind, but I wish you'd stop talking.
My dear, all her hair came out, and she said the social life was quite, quite horrid.
Provincial, you know, and very nouveau riche.
Oh, Dolly.
What's the matter, dear?
Are you feeling ill again? - No, not really ill. I feel a bit dizzy.
l think I'll close my eyes for a little.
Oh, you poor darling. And here am I chattering away 19 to the dozen. I won't say another word.
If you drop off, I'll wake you up when we get to the level crossing.
That'll give you a chance to pull yourself together and powder your nose before we get out.
Thanks, Dolly.
This can't last.
This misery can't last. I must remember that and try to control myself.
Nothing lasts, really - neither happiness nor despair.
Not even life lasts very long.
There'll come a time in the future when I shan't mind about this anymore... when I can look back and say quite peacefully and cheerfully how silly I was.
No, no, I don't want that time to come ever.
I want to remember every minute... always -
always to the end of my days.
Ketchworth!
Wake up, Laura. We're here.
Ketchworth!
I could easily come to the house with you, dear. It isn't very much out of my way.
Thank you. All I have to do is walk down Elmore Lane... past the grammar school and I shall be home in two minutes.
It's sweet of you, Dolly, but I'm perfectly all right now, really I am.
You're quite sure?
Absolutely positive. Thank you for being so kind.
Oh, nonsense, dear. I shall telephone in the morning and see if you've had a relapse.
I shall disappoint you. Good night.
Good night.
Oh, give my love to Fred and the children.
ls that you, Laura?
Yes, dear.
Thank goodness you've come back. The place has been in an uproar. - Why?
What's the matter?
Bobby and Margaret have been fighting again.
They won't go to sleep until you go in and talk to them about it.
Mummy? is that you, Mummy?
Yes, Margaret.
Come upstairs at once, Mummy! I want to talk to you.
You're both very naughty. You should have been asleep hours ago.
Now what is it, you two?
Well, Mummy, tomorrow's my birthday, and I want to go to the circus.
And tomorrow's not Margaret's birthday, and she wants to go to the pantomime.
My birthday's in June. There aren't any pantomimes in June.
It's far too late to discuss it tonight... and if you don't go to sleep at once, I shall tell Daddy not to let you go to either.
Oh, Mummy!
Why not take them to both? One in the afternoon, one in the evening?
You know that's impossible. We shouldn't get them to bed till all hours... and they'd be tired and fractious.
Well, then, one on one day and the other on the other.
You're always accusing me of spoiling the children.
Their characters would be ruined in a fortnight if I left them to your over-tender mercies.
All right, have it your own way.
Circus or pantomime?
Neither.
We'll thrash them both soundly, lock them up in the attic... and go to the pictures by ourselves.
Oh, Fred.
What on earth's the matter?
Nothing. lt's nothing.
Darling, what's wrong?
Tell me, please.
Really and truly, it's nothing. I - l'm just a little run-down, that's all.
I had a sort of fainting spell at the refreshment room at Milford. Isn't it idiotic?
Dolly Messiter was with me... and she talked and talked and talked until I wanted to strangle her.
Still, she meant to be kind. Isn't it awful about people meaning to be kind?
Would you like to go to bed?
No, Fred, really.
Come and sit by the fire in the library and relax. You can help me with the Times crossword.
You have the most peculiar ideas of relaxation.
That's better.
There you are, darling.
Thank you.
But why a fainting spell? I can't understand it.
Don't be silly, darling. I've often had fainting spells, and you know it.
Don't you remember Bobby's school concert and Eileen's wedding... and that time you insisted on taking me to that symphony concert at the town hall?
Go on, that was a nosebleed.
I suppose I must be that type of woman. It's very humiliating.
I still maintain there'd be no harm in you seeing Dr. Graves.
lt would be a waste of time. - Now, listen -
Oh, but do shut up about it, darling.
You're making a fuss about nothing.
I'd been shopping and I was tired... and the refreshment room was very hot, and I suddenly felt sick.
Nothing more than that.
All right.
Really nothing more than that. Now you get on with your old puzzle and leave me in peace.
Have it your own way. You're a poetry addict.
See if you can help me over this. lt's Keats.
When I behold, upon the night's starred face... huge cloudy symbols of a high" - something in seven letters.
Romance, I think. I'm almost sure it is.
Huge cloudy symbols of a high romance." lt'll be in the Oxford Book of English Verse.
No, that's right, I'm sure, because it fits in with "delirium" and "Baluchistan."
Would some music throw you off your stride?
No, dear, I'd like it.
Fred. Fred.
Dear Fred.
There's so much that I want to say to you.
You're the only one in the world with enough wisdom and gentleness to understand.
If only it were somebody else's story and not mine.
As it is, you are the only one in the world that I can never tell.
Never, never.
Because even if I waited until we were old, old people and told you then... you'd be bound to look back over the years and be hurt... and, oh, my dear, I don't want you to be hurt.
You see, we're a happily married couple... and must never forget that.
This is my home.
You're my husband... and my children are upstairs in bed.
I'm a happily married woman - or, rather, I was until a few weeks ago.
This is my whole world... and it's enough - or, rather, it was, until a few weeks ago.
But, oh, Fred, I've been so foolish.
I've fallen in love. I'm an ordinary woman.
I didn't think such violent things could happen to ordinary people.
It all started on an ordinary day... in the most ordinary place in the world... the refreshment room at Milford Junction.
I was having a cup of tea... and reading a book that I'd got that morning from Boots.
My train wasn't due for ten minutes.
I looked up and saw a man come in from the platform.
He had on an ordinary mac. His hat was turned down, and I didn't even see his face.
He got his tea at the counter and turned. Then I did see his face. It was rather a nice face.
Any sugar? - ln the spoon.
Thank you.
He passed my table on the way to his. - You're neglecting your duty.
The woman at the counter was going on as usual. You know, I told you about her the other day - the one with the refined voice.
Minnie hasn't touched her milk.
Did you put it down for her?
Yes, but she never came for it.
Fond of animals?
ln their place.
My landlady's got a positive mania for animals.
She's got two cats - one Manx, one ordinary - three rabbits in a hutch in the kitchen - they belong to her little boy by rights - and one of those dark-looking dogs with hair over its eyes.
I don't know to what breed you refer.
I don't think it knows itself.
Go and clean off number three, Beryl. I can see the crumbs on it from here.
What about my other cup? I'll have to be moving. The 5:40 will be in in a minute.
Who's on the gate?
Young William.
Please, could you give me a glass of water?
I've got something in my eye, and I want to bathe it.
Would you like me to have a look?
No, don't trouble. I expect the water will do. - Thank you.
Bit of coal dust, I expect.
A man I knew lost the sight in one eye through getting a bit of grit in it.
Nasty, very nasty.
Better? - l'm afraid not.
Ooh.
Can I help you?
Oh, no, please, it's only something in my eye.
Try pulling your eyelid down as far as it'll go.
And then blowing your nose.
Please let me look. I happen to be a doctor.
lt's very kind of you.
Turn around to the light, please.
Now look up.
Now look down.
Keep still. I see it.
There.
Oh, what a relief. lt was agonizing.
Looks like a bit of grit.
lt was when the express went through. Thank you very much, indeed.
There we go. I must run.
How lucky for me you happened to be here.
Anybody could've done it.
Never mind, you did, and I'm most grateful.
There's my train. I must go.
Good-bye.
That's how it all began - just through me getting a little piece of grit in my eye.
I completely forgot the whole incident. It didn't mean anything to me at all.
At least I didn't think it did.
The next Thursday I went into Milford again, as usual.
I changed my book at Boots. Miss Lewis had at last managed to get the new Kate O'Brien for me.
I believe she'd kept it hidden under the counter for two days.
On the way out, I bought two new toothbrushes for the children.
I like the smell of a chemist's better than any other shop. It's such a mixture of nice things - herbs and scent and soap.
That awful Mrs. Leftwich was at the other end of the counter... wearing one of the silliest hats l've ever seen.
Fortunately, she didn't look up, so I got out without her buttonhoIing me.
Just as I stepped out onto the pavement -
Good morning.
Oh, good morning.
How's the eye?
Perfectly all right. - How kind it was of you to take so much trouble.
lt was nothing at all.
lt's clearing up, I think.
Yes, it's going to be nice.
Well, I must be getting along to the hospital.
And I must be getting along to the grocers.
What exciting lives we lead, don't we?
That evening I had to run nearly all the way to the station.
I'd been to the Palladium, as usual, but it was a terribly long film... and I was afraid I'd be late.
As I came up onto the platform, the Churley train was just puffing out.
I looked up idly as the windows of the carriages went by, wondering if he was there.
I remember this crossing my mind, but it was quite unimportant.
I was really thinking of other things. The present for your birthday was worrying me rather.
It was terribly expensive, but I knew you wanted it... and I had sort of half taken the plunge and left a deposit on it... at Spink and Robson's until the next Thursday.
The next Thursday.
Well, I squared my conscience by thinking how pleased you would be and bought it.
Yes, I'll have it.
Thank you, madam.
It was wildly extravagant, I know, but having committed the crime... I suddenly felt reckless and gay.
The sun was out, and everybody in the street looked more cheerful than usual... and there was a barrel organ at the corner by Harris's... and you know how I love barrel organs.
It was playing "Let the Great Big World keep Turning"... and I gave the man sixpence and went to the Kardomah for lunch.
It was very full, but two people had got up from the table just as I had come in.
That was a bit of luck, wasn't it? Or was it?
Just after I had given my order, I saw him come in.
He looked a Iittle tired, I thought, and there was nowhere for him to sit... - so I smiled and said -
Good morning.
Oh, good morning. Are you all alone?
Yes, I am.
Would you mind if I shared your table?
It's very full. There doesn't seem to be anywhere else.
No, of course not.
I'm afraid we haven't been introduced properly. My name's Alec Harvey.
How do you do? Mine's Laura Jesson.
Mrs. or Miss?
Mrs.
You're a doctor, aren't you? I remember you said so that day in the refreshment room.
Yes. Not a very interesting one. Just an ordinary G.P. My practice is in Churley.
Yes, sir?
What did you plump for?
Excuse me, sir. - Um, the soup and fried sole.
Yes, I'll have the same.
Anything to drink?
No, thank you.
That is, would you like anything to drink?
No, thank you. Just plain water.
Plain water, please.
Will you just look at the cellist?
It really is dreadful, isn't it? But we oughtn't to laugh. They might see.
There should be a society for the prevention of cruelty to musical instruments.
You don't play the piano, I hope?
l was forced to as a child.
You haven't kept it up?
No, my husband isn't musical at all.
Good for him.
For all you know, I might have a tremendous burning professional talent.
Oh, dear, no.
Why are you so sure?
You're too sane and uncomplicated.
I suppose it's a good thing to be uncomplicated, but it does sound a little dull.
You could never be dull.
Do you come here every Thursday?
Yes, to spend a day at the hospital.
Stephen Lynn, the chief physician here, graduated with me.
I take over from him once a week. Gives him a chance to go up to London. - Gives me a chance to study the hospital patients.
l see.
Do you?
Do I what?
Come here every Thursday?
Oh. Yes, I do the week's shopping. Thank you.
Change my library book, have lunch and generally go to the pictures.
Not a very exciting routine, but it makes a change.
Are you going to the pictures this afternoon?
Yes. How extraordinary. So am I.
I thought you had to spend all day at the hospital.
Well, between ourselves, I killed two patients by accident this morning.
The matron's very displeased with me. I simply daren't go back.
How can you be so silly?
Seriously, I really did get through most of my work this morning.
It won't matter at all if I play truant. Would you mind very much if I came to the pictures with you?
Well, I - - l could sit downstairs, and you could sit upstairs.
Upstairs is too expensive.
The orchestra stopped as abruptly as it had started... and we began to laugh again.
I had no premonitions, although I suppose I should have had.
It all seemed so natural and so innocent.
We finished lunch, and that idiot of a waitress had put the bill all on one.
l really must insist.
l couldn't possibly.
Having forced my company on you, it's only fair that I should pay through the nose for it.
Please don't insist. I should so much rather we halved it. - l would really, please.
l shall give in gracefully.
We halved it meticulously.
We even halved the tip.
Thank you.
The Loves of Cardinal Richelieu at the Palace... - or Love in a Mist at the Palladium.
You're very knowledgeable.
There must be no argument about buying the tickets. We each pay for ourselves.
You must think me a very poor doctor if I can't afford a couple of one-and-ninepennies.
l insist.
l had hoped you were going to treat me.
Palace or Palladium?
Palladium.
I was once very sick on a channel steamer called Cardinal Richelieu.
Excuse me.
I feel awfully grand perched up here. It was very extravagant of you.
lt was a famous victory.
Do you feel guilty at all? I do.
Guilty? - You ought to more than me really.
You neglected your work this afternoon.
I worked this morning. A little relaxation never did harm to anyone. Why should either of us feel guilty?
l don't know.
How awfully nice you are.
It can't be.
It is.
We walked back to the station together. Just as we reached the gates, he put his hand under my arm.
I didn't notice it then, but I remember it now.
What's she like - your wife?
Madeleine?
Small, dark, rather delicate.
How funny. I should have thought she would've been fair.
And your husband? What's he like?
Medium height, brown hair, kindly, unemotional and not delicate at all.
You said that proudly.
Did I?
Good evening.
Good evening.
We've just got time for a cup of tea before our trains go.
And for the third time in one week, he brought that common man and his wife... to the house without so much as a "by your leave."
Two teas, please.
Cake or pastry?
Cake or pastry?
No, thank you.
Are those Bath buns fresh?
Certainly they are. Made this morning.
Two, please.
That'll be sevenpence.
Take the tea to the table, Beryl.
You must eat one of these. Fresh this morning.
Very fattening.
l don't hold to such foolishness.
They do look good, I must say.
One of my earliest passions in life. I've never outgrown it.
What happened then, Mrs. Bagot?
Well - Well, it's all very fine, I said, expecting me to do this, that and that other... but what do I get out of it?
You can't expect me to be a cook, housekeeper and char rolled into one during the day... and a loving wife in the evening, just because you feel like it.
There are just as good fish in the sea, I said, as ever came out of it.
And I packed me boxes then and there and left him.
Didn't you never go back?
Never.
Went to my sister's place at Folkestone for a bit.
Then I went in with a friend of mine, and we opened a tea shop in Hythe.
What happened to him?
Dead as a doornail inside three years.
Well, I never.
is tea bad for one? Worse than coffee, I mean?
If this is a professional interview, my fee is a guinea.
Why did you become a doctor?
That's a long story.
Perhaps because I'm a bit of an idealist.
I should think all doctors ought to have ideals really.
Otherwise their work would be unbearable.
Surely you're not encouraging me to talk shop?
Why shouldn't you talk shop? It's what interests you most, isn't it?
Yes, it is. I'm terribly ambitious really.
Not ambitious for myself so much as for my special pigeon.
What is your special pigeon?
Preventive medicine.
l see.
l'm afraid you don't.
l was trying to be intelligent.
Most good doctors... especially when they're young, have private dreams. That's the best part of them.
Sometimes, though... those get over-professionalized and strangulated - am I boring you?
No, I don't quite understand, but you're not boring me.
All good doctors must primarily be enthusiasts.
They must, like writers and painters and priests - they must have a sense of vocation...
a deep-rooted, unsentimental desire to do good.
Yes, I see that.
Well, obviously one way of preventing disease is worth 50 ways of curing it. That's where my ideal comes in.
Preventive medicine isn't anything to do with medicine at all really.
It's concerned with conditions - living conditions and hygiene and common sense.
For instance, my speciality is pneumoconiosis.
Oh, dear.
Don't be alarmed. lt's simpler than it sounds.
It's nothing but a slow process of fibrosis of the lung... due to the inhalation of particles of dust.
In the hospital here there are splendid opportunities... for observing cures and making notes because of the coal mines.
You suddenly look much younger.
Do I?
Almost like a little boy.
What made you say that?
I don't know.
Yes, I do.
Tell me.
Oh, no, I couldn't, really. You were saying about the coal mines.
Oh, yes, the inhalation of coal dust.
That's one specific form of the disease. It's called anthracosis.
What are the others?
Chalicosis - that comes from metal dust - steelworks, you know.
Yes, of course, steelworks.
And silicosis - that's stone dust - gold mines.
I see.
There's your train.
Yes.
You mustn't miss it.
No.
What's the matter? - Nothing.
Nothing at all, really. It's been so very nice.
I've enjoyed my afternoon enormously.
I'm so glad. So have l. l apologize for boring you with long medical words.
I feel dull and stupid not to be able to understand more.
Shall I see you again?
It's the other platform, isn't it? You'll have to run. Don't bother about me.
Mine's not due for a few minutes. Shall I see you again?
Yes, of course. Perhaps you'd come out to Ketchworth one Sunday.
lt's rather far, I know, but we should be delighted. - Please, please.
What is it?
Next Thursday, the same time. - No, I couldn't possibly.
Please.
I ask you most humbly.
You'll miss your train. - All right.
Run.
Good-bye.
I'll be there.
Thank you, my dear.
I stood there and watched his train draw out of the station.
I stared after it until its taiIlight had vanished into the darkness.
I imagined him getting out at Churley... giving up his ticket... walking back through the streets... letting himself into his house with his latchkey.
His wife
Madeleine - would probably be in the hall to meet him.
Or perhaps upstairs in her room, not feeling very well.
Small, dark and rather delicate."
I wondered if he'd say...
l met such a nice woman at the Kardomah. We had lunch and went to the pictures."
Then suddenly, I knew that he wouldn't. I knew beyond a shadow of doubt that he wouldn't say a word.
At that moment, the first awful feeling of danger swept over me.
I got into the first compartment l saw. I wanted to get home as quickly as possible.
I looked hurriedly round the carriage to see if anyone was looking at me... as if they could read my secret thoughts.
No one was, except a clergyman in the opposite corner.
I felt myself blushing and opened my library book and pretended to read.
By the time I'd got to Ketchworth, I'd made up my mind definitely... - that I wasn't going to see Alec anymore.
Good evening, Mrs. Jesson.
It was silly and undignified, flirting like that with a complete stranger.
Oh, good evening.
I walked up to the house quite briskly and cheerfully.
I'd been behaving like an idiot, admittedly, but after all, no harm had been done.
You met me in the hall. Your face was strained and worried, and my heart sank.
Fred, what's the matter?
lt's all right, old girl, but you must keep calm and not be upset.
What is it? What's wrong?
It's Bobby. He was knocked down by a car on the way home from school.
Now it's not serious.
He was just grazed by the mudguard... but it knocked him against the curb, and he's got slight concussion. The doctor's upstairs with him now.
It's all right, Mrs. Jesson. Nothing to worry about. He'll be as right as rain in a few hours.
You're sure? You're sure it's not serious?
Quite sure, but it was certainly a very lucky escape.
I've given him a little sedative, and I shall advise... keeping him at home for a couple of days.
It must have been a bit of a shock - l felt so dreadful, Fred, looking at him, Iying there... with that bandage round his head.
I tried not to show it, but I was quite hysterical inside... as though the whole thing were my fault - a sort of punishment, an awful, sinister warning.
An hour or two later, of course, everything became quite normal again.
He began to enjoy the whole thing thoroughly... and reveled in the fact that he was the center of attraction.
Oh, good!
Do you remember how we spent the whole evening planning his future?
But he's much too young to decide really.
Good life, if the boy has a feeling for it.
How can he possibly really know if he has a feeling for it?
He'll probably want to be an engine driver next week.
No, it was last week he wanted to be an engine driver.
It seems so final, somehow, entering a child of that age for the navy.
lt's a healthy life.
l know it's a good life... and I know it's a healthy life... and I know he'll be able to see the world and have a wife in every port... and keep on calling everybody "sir," but what about us?
What do you mean, "What about us?"
We shall hardly ever see him.
Oh, nonsense. - lt isn't nonsense.
He'll be sent away to sea as a smooth-faced boy... and the next thing we know, he'll come walking in with a long beard and a parrot.
I think you take rather a Victorian view of the navy, my dear.
He's our only son, and I should like to be there while he's growing up.
All right, old girl. Then we'll put him into an office... and you can see him off on the 8:50 every morning.
You really are very annoying. You know perfectly well l should hate that.
All right, have it your own way.
Fred? - Hmm?
I had lunch with a strange man today, and he took me to the movies. Good for you.
He's awfully nice. He's a doctor.
A very noble profession.
Oh, dear.
It was Richard lll who said "My kingdom for a horse," wasn't it?
Yes, darling.
Yes, well, I wish to goodness he hadn't, 'cause it spoils everything.
I thought perhaps we might ask him to dinner one night. By all means.
Who?
Dr. Harvey - the one I was telling you about.
Must it be dinner?
Well, you're never at home for lunch.
Exactly.
Oh, Fred.
Now what on earth's the matter?
It's nothing. lt's only - Oh, Fred.
I really don't see what's so frightfully funny.
Oh, I do. lt's all right, darling. I'm not laughing at you. I'm laughing at me.
I'm the one that's funny.
I'm an absolute idiot, worrying myself about things that don't exist... and making mountains out of molehills.
I told you when you came in that it was nothing serious.
There was nothing to get into such a state about.
I do see that now, I really do.
When Thursday came, I went to meet Alec... more as a matter of politeness than for any other reason.
It didn't seem of any importance, but, after all, I had promised.
I managed to get the same table. I waited a bit, but he didn't come.
The ladies' orchestra was playing away, as usual.
I looked at the cellist. She had seemed to be so funny last week... but today, she didn't seem funny anymore.
She looked pathetic, poor thing.
After lunch, I happened to pass by the hospital.
I remember looking up at the windows and wondering if he were there... or whether something awful had happened to prevent him turning up.
I got to the station earlier than usual. I hadn't enjoyed the pictures much.
It was one of those noisy musical things, and I'm so sick of them. I had come out before it was over.
As I took my tea to the table, I suddenly wondered if I'd made a mistake... and he'd meant me to meet him there.
Albert Godby, how dare you!
l couldn't resist.
l'll trouble you to keep your hands to yourself.
Oh, you're blushing.
You look wonderful when you're angry, just like an avenging angel.
I'll give you avenging angel, coming in here taking liberties.
I thought after what you said last Monday you wouldn't object to a friendly little slap.
Never you mind about last Monday. I'm on duty now.
A nice thing if Mr. Saunders had happened to be looking through the window.
If Mr. Saunders is in the habit of looking through windows... it's about time he saw something worth looking at.
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
lt's high spirits, don't be mad at me.
High spirits, indeed. Take your tea, and be quiet.
lt's all your fault, really.
l don't know to what you're referring.
I was thinking of, um, tonight.
If you don't learn to behave yourself, there won't be a tonight or any other night, either.
Give us a kiss.
l'll do no such thing. The lady might see us.
Come on, a quick one across the bar.
Albert, stop it!
Come, there's a love.
Let go of me this minute. Albert!
Now look at me Banburys all over the floor.
Just in time, or born in the vestry?
You shut your mouth and help Mr. Godby pick up them cakes.
Come along now - what are you standing there gaping at?
As I left the refreshment room, I saw a train coming in - his train.
He wasn't on the platform, and I suddenly felt panic-stricken... at the thought of not seeing him again.
My dear, I'm so sorry. I'd no way of letting you know.
Your train, you'll miss it.
The house surgeon had to operate suddenly.
I was going to send a note to the Kardomah, but I thought they might shout your name out and embarrass you.
Please don't say any more.
Quickly, quickly, the whistle's gone.
I'm so glad I had a chance to explain. I didn't think I'd see you again.
How absurd. Quickly, quickly.
Next Thursday?
Yes, next Thursday.
Good-bye!
Good-bye!
Next Thursday! Good-bye!
The train for Ketchworth is about to leave from platform three.
The stars can change in their courses, the universe go up in flames... and the world crash around us, but there'll always be Donald Duck.
I do love him so - his dreadful energy and his blind frustrated rages. It's the big picture now.
Here we go. No more laughter.
It was a terribly bad picture.
We crept out before the end, rather furtively... as though we were committing a crime.
The usherette at the door looked at us with stony contempt.
It was a lovely afternoon, and it was a relief to be in the fresh air.
We decided we'd go to the botanical gardens.
Do you know, I believe we should all behave quite differently... if we lived in a warm, sunny climate all the time.
We shouldn't be so withdrawn and shy and difficult.
Oh, Fred, it really was a lovely afternoon. There were some little boys sailing their boats.
One of them looked awfully like Bobby. That should have given me a pang of conscience, I know, but it didn't.
I was enjoying myself - enjoying every single minute.
Alec suddenly said that he was sick of staring at the water... and that he wanted to be on it.
All the boats were covered up, but we managed to persuade the old man to let us have one.
He thought we were raving mad. Perhaps he was right.
Alec rode off at a great rate... and I trailed my hand in the water.
It was very cold, but a lovely feeling.
You don't row very well, do you?
I'm going to be perfectly honest with you - l don't row at all... and unless you want to go round and round in ever-narrowing circles... you'd better start steering.
Oh, we had such fun, Fred. I felt gay and happy and sort of released.
That's what's so shameful about it all.
That's what would hurt you so much if you knew - that I could feel as intensely as that... away from you, with a stranger. - Oh, look out!
We can't get through!
Pull on your left!
Oh, dear, I never could tell left from right.
I'm most awfully sorry.
You know the British have always been nice to mad people.
That boatman thinks we're quite dotty, but look how sweet he's been.
Tea, milk, even sugar.
Thank you.
You know what's happened, don't you?
Yes. Yes, I do.
I've fallen in love with you.
Yes, I know.
Tell me honestly. Please tell me honestly if what I believe is true.
What do you believe?
That it's the same with you - that you've fallen in love too. - lt sounds so silly.
Why?
l know you so little.
lt is true though, isn't it?
Yes, it's true.
Laura. No, please, we must be sensible. Please help me to be sensible.
We mustn't behave like this. We must forget that we've said what we've said.
Not yet, not quite yet.
But we must. Don't you see?
Listen, it's too late now to be as sensible as all that.
It's too late to forget what we've said... and anyway, whether we'd said it or not couldn't have mattered.
We know. We've both of us known for a long time.
How can you say that?
I've only known you for four weeks.
We only talked for the first time last Thursday week.
Last Thursday week. Has it been a long time for you since then? Answer me truly.
Yes.
How often did you decide that you were never going to see me again?
Several times a day.
So did I.
Oh, Alec.
l love you. I love your wide eyes... and the way you smile... and your shyness...
and the way you laugh at my jokes.
Please don't.
I love you. I love you. You love me too.
It's no use pretending it hasn't happened, because it has.
Yes, it has. I don't want to pretend anything either to you or to anyone else... but from now on, I shall have to.
That's what's wrong, don't you see?
That's what spoils everything.
That's why we must stop here and now talking like this. We're neither of us free to love each other. There's too much in the way.
There's still time... if we control ourselves and behave like sensible human beings.
There's still time to -
There's no time at all.
There's your train.
Yes.
I'll come over to the platform with you.
No, Alec, not here. Someone will see.
I love you so.
Do you think we might have that down a bit, darling?
Hi, Laura.
Yes, dear?
You were miles away. Was I?
Yes, I suppose I was.
Do you mind if we turn that down a little?
It really is deafening.
No, of course not.
I shan't be long over this, darling, then we'll go up to bed.
You look a bit tired, you know.
Don't hurry. I'm perfectly happy.
How can I possibly say that?
Don't hurry. I'm perfectly happy."
If only it were true.
Not, I suppose, that anybody is ever perfectly happy, really.
But just to be ordinarily contented, to be at peace.
It's such a little while ago, really, but it seems an eternity... since that train went out of the station... taking him away into the darkness.
I was happy then. As I went back through the subway to my own platform... I was walking on air.
When I got into the train, I didn't even pretend to read.
I didn't care whether people were looking at me or not.
I had to think. I should have been utterly wretched and ashamed. I know I should, but I wasn't.
I felt suddenly quite wildly happy...
like a romantic schoolgirl, like a romantic fool. You see, he had said he loved me, and I had said I loved him.
And it was true. lt was true.
I imagined him holding me in his arms. I imagined being with him in all sorts of glamorous circumstances.
It was one of those absurd fantasies, just like one has when one is a girl... being wooed and married by the ideal of one's dreams.
I stared out of that railway carriage window into the dark... and watched the dim trees and the telegraph posts slipping by... and through them, I saw Alec and me.
Alec and me - perhaps a little younger than we are now, but just as much in love... and with nothing in the way.
I saw us in Paris, in a box at the opera.
The orchestra was tuning up.
Then we were in Venice, drifting along the Grand Canal in a gondola... with the sound of mandolins coming to us over the water.
I saw us traveling far away together... all the places I've always longed to go.
I saw us leaning on the rail of a ship, looking at the sea and the stars... standing on a tropical beach in the moonlight... with the palm trees sighing above us.
Then the palm trees changed into those pollarded willows by the canal... just before the level crossing... and all the silly dreams disappeared... and I got out at Ketchworth and gave up my ticket... and walked home as usual... quite soberly and without wings -
without any wings at all.
When I had changed for dinner and was doing my face a bit - Do you remember?
I don't suppose you do, but I do.
You see, you didn't know that that was the first time in our life together... that I had ever lied to you.
It started then - the shame of the whole thing... the guiltiness, the fear.
Good evening, Mrs. Jesson.
Hello, dear. - Had a good day? - Yes, lovely.
What'd you do?
Well, I shopped... and had lunch and went to the pictures.
All by yourself?
Yes. Uh, no, not exactly.
What do you mean, "not exactly"?
Well, I went to the pictures by myself, but I had lunch with Mary Norton.
She couldn't come to the pictures 'cause she had to go and see her in-laws.
They live just outside Milford, you know. So I walked with her to the bus and then came home on my own.
Haven't seen Mary Norton for ages. How is she looking?
Very well, really. A little fatter, I thought.
Hurry up with all this beautifying. I want my dinner.
You go on down. I won't be five minutes.
Number, please?
Ketchworth 3-7, please.
Ketchworth 3-7.
Hello?
Hello, is Mrs. Norton there, please?
Yes. will you hold on? - Yes, I'll hold on.
Hello?
Hello?
is that you, Mary?
Oh, Laura!
Fancy hearing from you. I thought you were dead.
No, I haven't seen you for ages.
Listen, my dear... will you be a saint and back me up in the most appalling domestic lie?
As bad as all that?
My life depends on it.
Well, today, I went into Milford, as usual, to do my shopping... with the special intention of buying a far too expensive present for Fred's birthday.
well, Spink and Robson's hadn't got what I wanted... which was one of those clocks with, um, barometers and everything in one... but they rang up their branch in Broadham and said there was one there... so I hopped on the 1 :30 train and went to get it.
Go on. - Well, this is where the black lie comes in.
Fred asked me if I'd had a good day, and I said yes... and that you and I had lunch together and that you had gone to see your in-laws... and I had gone to the pictures.
So if you run into him, don't let me down, will you?
Darling, of course not. - l'll do as much for you, I promise.
Well, Iet's really lunch one day.
Yes, that'd be lovely.
What about next Thursday?
No, I can't on Thursday. That's my Milford day. What about Friday?
Fine, better make it here.
All right, perfect.
You know what my cook's like. It'll have to be early.
Yes, all right.
Good-bye.
That week was misery.
I went through it in a sort of trance.
How odd of you not to have noticed that you were living with a stranger in the house.
Thursday came at last. I had arranged to meet Alec outside the hospital at 12:30.
Hello.
Hello.
I thought you wouldn't come. I've been thinking all the week that you wouldn't come.
I didn't mean to really, but here I am.
Do you know, I hadn't been inside the Royal since Violet's wedding reception.
It all seemed very grand.
He actually ordered a bottle of champagne... and when I protested, he said that we were only middle-aged once.
We were very gay during lunch and talked about quite ordinary things.
Oh, Fred, he really was charming. I know you would have liked him if only things had been different.
As we were going out, he said that he had a surprise for me... and that if I would wait in the lounge for five minutes, he'd show me what it was.
He went out and down the steps at a run... more like an excited schoolboy than a respectable doctor.
Suddenly out of the dining room came Mary Norton and that rich over-made-up cousin of hers.
They must have been in the dining room all the time... and seen Alec and me and the champagne and everything. Laura!
So it was you after all.
Hermione said it was. - How are you? - You know how shortsighted I am.
I peered and peered and still couldn't be sure.
I never saw you at all. How awful of me. I expect it was the champagne.
I'm not used to champagne for lunch. Or for dinner either, for that matter, but Alec insisted.
Alec? Alec who, dear?
Alec Harvey, of course.
Surely you remember the Harveys. I've known them for years.
No, I don't think I ever - - He'll be back in a minute.
You'll probably recognize him when you peer very closely.
He looks very charming and very attentive.
He's a dear.
One of the nicest people in the world and a wonderful doctor.
Oh, Alec, you remember Mrs. Norton, don't you?
l'm afraid I don't. It's no use, Laura.
We've never seen each other before in our lives. I'm quite sure we haven't.
How absurd. I made certain he and Madeleine were there when you dined with us... just before Christmas last year.
Alec, this is Mrs. Rolandson.
How do you do? - How do you do?
Horrid weather, isn't it?
Yes. Of course, one can't really expect spring at this time of the year, can one? No.
No.
Well, we must be going. I'm taking Hermione with me to see the in-laws as moral support.
Good-bye, Dr. Harvey.
Good-bye.
Good-bye, my dear. I do so envy you your champagne.
Good-bye.
That was awful.
Never mind.
They'd been watching us all through lunch. Oh, dear. Forget it.
Come out and look at the surprise.
There at the foot of the steps was a little two-seater car.
Alec had borrowed it from Stephen Lynn for the afternoon.
I tried so hard to look pleased, but it wasn't any good.
I kept thinking of those two laughing and talking...
laughing and talking about us, and I couldn't get them out of my mind.
When we were out in the real country - I think it was a few miles beyond Brayfield - we stopped the car just outside a village and got out.
There was a little bridge and a stream... and the sun was making an effort to come out, but really not suceeeding very well.
We leaned on the parapet of the bridge and looked down into the water.
I shivered, and Alec put his arm round me.
Cold?
No, not really.
Happy?
No, not really.
I know exactly what you're going to say.
That it isn't worth it.
That the furtiveness and lying outweigh the happiness we might have together.
Isn't that it?
Something like that.
I want to ask you something, just to reassure myself.
What is it?
It is true for you, isn't it?
This overwhelming feeling we have for each other - it's as true for you as it is for me, isn't it?
Yes, it's true.
We must have stayed on that bridge for a long time... because when we got back to Stephen Lynn's garage, it was getting dark.
I remember feeling as if I was on the edge of a precipice. I think Alec felt that too.
You see, we both knew how desperately we loved each other.
Alec said that he had to leave the keys of the car in Stephen Lynn's flat... and suggested that I came up with him.
I refused rather too vehemently.
Alec reminded me that Stephen wasn't coming back till late, but I still refused.
I'm going back. I'm going to miss my train.
Back where?
To Stephen's flat.
Oh, Alec.
Alec, I must go home now.
I really must go home.
A cup of tea, please.
Good afternoon.
Afternoon, lady. - Afternoon.
Couple of whiskeys, please.
Very sorry. lt's out of hours.
Well, just sneak 'em to us under the cover of them poor old sandwiches.
Them sandwiches were fresh this morning, and I shall do no such thing.
Come on, be a sport.
You can have as much as you want to after 6:00.
My throat's like a parrot's cage.
Listen. I'm sorry. My license does not permit me to serve alcohol out of hours.
You wouldn't want to get me into trouble, would you?
Just give us the chance, lady. That's all we ask. Just give us the chance.
Beryl! - Yes, Mrs. Bagot?
Ask Mr. Godby to come here for a moment, will you?
Yes, Mrs. Bagot.
Oh, and who's he when he's at home?
You'll soon see. - Coming in here cheeking me.
Come off it, mother. Be a pal.
l'll give you "mother," you saucy upstart.
Oi, oi, who you callin' an upstart?
You! And I'll trouble you to get out of here double quick.
Disturbing the customers and making a nuisance of yourselves.
Here, where's the fire, where's the fire?
What's going on in here?
Mr. Godby, these gentlemen are annoying me.
What? We haven't done nothing, have we, Johnnie?
All we did was ask a couple of drinks, that's all.
They insulted me, Mr. Godby.
We never did anything of the kind. - Just having a little joke, that's all.
Hop it, both of you.
We've got a right to stay here as long as we like.
You heard what I said.
Hop it. Now, look here.
What is this, a free country or a bloomin' Sunday school?
I checked your warrants at the gate. - Your train's due in one minute, number two platform.
Hop it. - Now, look here -
Aw, come on, Johnnie. Come on.
Don't argue with the poor basket.
Cheerio, mother.
And if them sandwiches were made this morning, you're Shirley Temple.
Thank you, Albert.
What a nerve - talking to you like that, Mrs. Bagot.
Be quiet, Beryl. Pour me out a nip of Three Star. I'm feeling quite upset.
l must get back to the gate.
l'll be seeing you later, Albert.
Okay.
The train now arriving at platform three... is the 5:43 for Ketchworth.
l really must go home.
I'm going back to the flat.
I must go home. I really must go home.
l'm going back to the flat.
I'm going home.
Excuse me. I've forgotten something.
Darling.
It's raining. It started just as I turned out of the high street.
You had no umbrella, and your coat's wet. You mustn't catch cold.
l look an absolute fright.
Let me put that down for you.
Thank you.
I hope the fire will perk up in a few minutes.
l expect the wood was damp.
Yes, I expect it was.
Do sit down, darling.
I got right into the train and then got out again. Wasn't it idiotic?
We're both very, very foolish.
Alec, I can't stay, you know. Really, I can't.
Just a little while. Just a little while.
Quickly, quickly!
I must go.
Here, through the kitchen. There's a tradesman's staircase.
ls that you, Alec?
You're back early.
Yes, I felt a cold coming on... so I denied myself the always questionable pleasure of dining... with that arch-arguer Roger Hinchley and decided to come back to bed.
lnflamed membranes are unsympathetic to a dialectic.
What'll you do about food?
I can always ring down to the restaurant if I want any later on.
We live in a modern age, and this is a service flat.
Yes, yes, of course.
It caters for all tastes.
You know, my dear Alec, you have hidden depths which I never even suspected.
Look here, Stephen -
Oh, for heaven's sake, Alec. No explanations or apologies.
I am the one who should apologize for returning so inopportunely.
It's quite obvious to me that you were interviewing a patient privately.
Women are frequently rather neurotic creatures... and the hospital atmosphere is upsetting to them.
By the rather undignified scuffling which I heard when I came into the hall... I gather that she beat a hasty retreat down the back stairs.
I'm surprised at this farcical streak in your nature, Alec.
After all, we've been friends for years... and I am the most broad-minded of men.
I'm really very sorry, Stephen.
I'm sure that the whole situation must seem inexpressibly vulgar to you.
Actually, it isn't in the least.
However, you're perfectly right: Explanations are unnecessary... particularly between old friends.
l must go now.
Very well.
l'll collect my hat and coat. Good-bye.
Perhaps you'll let me have my latchkey back.
I only have two, and I'm so afraid of losing them. You know how absentminded I am.
You're very angry, aren't you?
No, Alec, not angry, just disappointed.
I ran until I couldn't run any longer. I leant against a lamppost to try and get my breath.
I was in one of those side roads that lead out of the high street.
I know it was stupid to run, but I couldn't help myself.
I felt so utterly humiliated and defeated and so dreadfully, dreadfully ashamed.
After a moment or two I pulled myself together... and walked on in the direction of the station.
It was still raining, but not very much.
I suddenly realized that I couldn't go home... not until I had got myself more under control and had a Iittle time to think.
Then I thought of you waiting at home and the dinner being spoilt... so I went into the high street and found a tobacconist and telephoned to you.
Do you remember?
Hello, Fred, is that you?
Yes, dear, it's me, Laura.
Yes, everything's perfectly all right, but I shan't be home to dinner.
I'm with Miss Lewis. Miss Lewis, dear. You know, the librarian I told you about at Boots.
Y-Yes, I can't explain in any detail because she's outside the box now.
Well, I met her in the high street a little while ago in a terrible state.
Her mother's been taken ill, and I've promised to stay with her until the doctor comes.
Yes, I know, but she's always been awfully kind to me, and I feel so sorry for her.
No, I'll get a sandwich, but ask Ethel to leave me some soup in a saucepan in the kitchen.
Yes, of course, as soon as I can.
All right. Good-bye.
It's awfully easy to lie when you know that you're trusted implicitly - so very easy and so very degrading.
I started walking without much purpose. I turned out of the high street almost immediately.
I was terrified that I might run into Alec.
I was pretty certain that he'd come after me to the station.
I walked for a long while.
finally, I found myself at the war memorial - you know, it's right at the other side of the town.
It had stopped raining altogether, and I felt stifIingly hot... so I sat down on one of the seats.
I know how you disapprove of women smoking in the street
I do too, really - but I wanted to calm my nerves, and I thought it might help.
I sat there for ages - l don't know how long - then I noticed a policeman walking up and down a Iittle way off.
He was looking at me rather suspiciously.
Presently he came up to me.
Feeling all right, miss?
Yes, thank you.
Waiting for someone? No.
No, I'm not waiting for anybody.
Don't go and catch cold now. It's a damp night for sitting about on seats.
I'm going now anyhow. I've got to catch a train.
You're sure you feel quite all right?
Quite, thank you.
Good night.
Good night, miss.
I walked away, trying to look casual, knowing that he was watching me.
I felt like a criminal.
I walked rather quickly back in the direction of the high street.
I got to the station 15 minutes before the last train to Ketchworth.
And then I realized that I had been wandering about for over three hours... but it didn't seem to be any time at all.
Stan, you are awful.
See ya in the yard.
All right.
I'd like a glass of brandy, please.
We're just closing'.
Yes, I see you are, but you're not quite closed yet, are you?
Three Star?
That'll do.
Oh, and have you got a piece of paper and an envelope?
l'm afraid you'll have to get that at the bookstall.
Well, the bookstall's closed.
Please, it's very important. I should be so much obliged.
All right. Just a minute.
Thank you very much.
We close in a few minutes, you know.
Yes, I know.
Darling, I've been looking for you everywhere.
Please go away. Please don't.
l've watched every train.
Please go away.
l can't leave you like this.
You must. lt'll be better, really it will.
You're being dreadfully cruel. lt was just an accident that he came back early.
He doesn't know who you are. He never even saw you.
l supposed he laughed, didn't he?
l suppose you spoke of me together as men of the world.
We didn't speak of you. - We spoke of some nameless creature who has no reality.
Why didn't you tell him who I was? Why didn't you say we were cheap and low and without courage?
Stop it, Laura.
Pull yourself together. - lt's true, isn't it?
It's nothing of the sort. We know we really love each other. That's true.
That's all that really matters. It isn't all that really matters. Other things matter too.
Self-respect matters, and decency. I can't go on any longer.
Could you really say good-bye, never see me again?
Yes, if you'd help me.
I love you, Laura. I shall love you always until the end of my life.
I can't look at you now because I know something.
I know that this is the beginning of the end - not the end of my loving you, but the end of our being together.
But not quite yet, darling. Please, not quite yet. Very well.
Not quite yet.
I know what you feel about this evening - l mean about the sordidness of it.
I know about the strain of our different lives - our lives apart from each other.
The feeling of guilt, doing wrong is too strong, isn't it?
Too great a price to pay for the happiness we have together.
I know all this because it's the same for me too.
You can look at me now. I'm all right.
Let's be very careful. Let's prepare ourselves.
A sudden break now, however brave and admirable, would be too cruel.
We can't do such violence to our hearts and minds.
Very well.
l'm going away.
l see.
But not quite yet.
Please, not quite yet.
That's the 10:10. it's after closing time.
Oh, is it?
l shall have to lock up.
l want you to promise me something.
What is it?
Promise me that however unhappy you are... and however much you think things over...
that you'll meet me again next Thursday.
Where?
Outside the hospital at 12:30.
All right. I promise.
l've got to talk to you. I've got to explain.
About going away?
Yes.
Where will you go? Where can you go?
You can't give up your practice.
I've had a job offered me. I wasn't going to tell you.
I wasn't going to take it, but I know now it's the only way out.
Where? - A long way away
Johannesburg.
Oh, Alec.
My brother's out there.
They're opening a new hospital. They want me in it.
It's a fine opportunity, really. I'll take Madeleine and the boys.
It's been torturing me - the necessity of making a decision one way or the other.
I haven't told anybody, not even Madeleine.
I couldn't bear the thought of leaving you... but now I see it's got to happen soon anyway.
It's almost happening already.
Stanley!
When will you go?
Almost immediately, in about two weeks' time.
Quite near, isn't it?
Do you want me to stay?
Do you want me to turn down the offer?
Don't be foolish, Alec.
I'll do whatever you say.
That's unkind of you, my darling.
The train for Ketchworth is now arriving at platform three.
You're not angry with me, are you?
No, I'm not angry. I don't think I'm anything, really. I just feel tired.
Forgive me?
Forgive you for what?
For everything - for meeting you in the first place... for taking the piece of grit out of your eye... for loving you, for bringing you so much misery.
I'll forgive you if you'll forgive me.
Thursday.
All that was a week ago.
It's hardly credible that it should be so short a time.
Today was our last day together - our very last together in all our lives.
I met him outside the hospital as I had promised at 12:30 - at 12:30 this morning.
That was only this morning.
We drove into the country again, but this time he hired a car.
I lit cigarettes for him every now and then as we went along. We didn't talk much.
I felt numbed and hardly alive at all.
We had lunch in a village pub.
Afterwards, we went to the same bridge over the stream - the bridge that we'd been to before.
Those last few hours went by so quickly.
As we walked through the station, I remember thinking... "This is the last time with Alec.
I shall see all this again, but without Alec."
I tried not to think of it... not to let it spoil our last moments together.
Are you all right, darling?
Yes, I'm all right.
I wish I could think of something to say.
It doesn't matter - not saying anything, I mean.
l'll miss my train and wait to see you to yours.
No, please don't. I'll come over with you to your platform. I'd rather.
Very well.
Do you think we shall ever see each other again?
I don't know. Not for years anyway.
The children will all be grown up. I wonder if they'll ever meet and know each other.
Couldn't I write to you, just once in a while?
No, Alec, please. You know we promised.
Well, all right, dear. I do love you so very much.
I love you with all my heart and soul. I want to die.
If only I could die.
If you died, you'd forget me.
I want to be remembered.
Yes, I know. I do too.
We've still got a few minutes.
Laura, what a lovely surprise!
My dear, I've been shopping till I'm dropping. My feet are nearly falling off.
My throat's parched. I thought of having tea at Spindle's, but I was terrified of losing the train. Oh, dear!
Oh, this is Dr. Harvey.
How do you do? How do you do?
Would you be a perfect dear and get me a cup of tea?
l really don't think I could drag my poor old bones over to the counter.
No, please. It was cruel of fate to be against us right up to the very last minute.
dolly Messiter - poor, well-meaning, irritating Dolly Messiter - crashing into those last few precious minutes we had together.
She chattered and fussed, but I didn't hear what she said. - I felt dazed and bewildered.
Oh, dear. No sugar.
lt's in the spoon.
Alec behaved so beautifully... with such perfect politeness.
No one could have guessed what he was really feeling.
And then -
There's your train.
Yes, I know.
Oh, aren't you coming with us?
No, I go in the opposite direction. My practice is in Churley.
Oh, I see.
l'm a general practitioner at the moment.
Dr. Harvey's going out to Africa next week.
Oh, how thrilling.
The train now arriving at platform four... is the 5:40 for ChurIey, Leigh Green and Langdon.
l must go.
Yes, you must.
Good-bye.
I felt the touch of his hand on my shoulder for a moment... and then he walked away -
away, out of my life forever.
He's got to get right over to the other platform. Talking of missing trains reminds me of that awful bridge at Broadham Junction.
Dolly still went on talking, but I wasn't listening to her.
I was listening for the sound of his train starting.
Then it did.
I said to myself, "He didn't go. At the Iast minute his courage failed him. He couldn't have gone.
Any minute now he'lI come back into the refreshment room... pretending he's forgotten something."
I prayed for him to do that... just so that I could see him again for an instant.
But the minutes went by.
is that the train?
Oh, can you tell me, is that the Ketchworth train?
No, it's the express.
The boat train.
Oh, of course. That doesn't stop, does it?
l want some chocolate, please.
I meant to do it, Fred. I really meant to do it.
I stood there trembling right on the edge... but I couldn't.
I wasn't brave enough.
I should like to be able to say that it was the thought... of you and the children that prevented me, but it wasn't.
I had no thoughts at all.
Only an overwhelming desire not to feel anything ever again.
Not to be unhappy anymore.
I turned... and went back into the refreshment room.
That's when I nearly fainted.
Laura.
Yes, dear?
Whatever your dream was, it wasn't a very happy one, was it? No.
is there anything I can do to help?
Yes, Fred. You always help.
You've been a long way away.
Yes.
Thank you for coming back to me.
THE LADIES OF THE BOIS DE BOULOGNE
I haven't shown you a very good time.
You're suffering.
I know I annoy you, but I'm your oldest friend.
Though you keep silent, I must speak.
Hélène, you have sacrificed everything for a lover who no longer loves you.
Jean and I adore each other.
You know very well what I mean.
Observe him as I observe you.
There is no such thing as love, only proofs of love.
Our happiness disturbs our friends.
I'm sorry, but I'm happy.
I only wanted to warn you, because I love you with all my heart.
Good night, Jacques.
The play was long and I'm exhausted.
Good night.
Jean!
You frightened me.
I rushed over to apologize for forgetting so stupidly.
Such a thing doesn't matter between us.
I'm tired.
I completely forgot I was to dine with you tonight.
I have no excuse. It's unforgivable.
Do you like this case?
I love gold.
It's like you... warm, cold, light, dark... incorruptible.
What a beautiful thing!
Thank you.
It was your anniversary gift. You would have found it at your seat.
Anniversary?
It was two years ago that we decided to live for each other.
What a monster I am!
Don't be so hard on yourself.
We all have something to blame ourselves for.
Even you?
Even me.
Tell me.
It might be better not to.
We vowed never to keep anything from each other.
That's the trouble.
I've held back from telling you for some time now.
I didn't want to hurt you.
You, hurt me?
Here it is, then.
It happened gradually, without my realizing it.
I couldn't laugh. I couldn't sleep.
I wondered if it was your fault, but no.
You're as wonderful as ever.
You stay the same.
I ask myself over and over:
Why am I no longer impatient?
Why is waiting no longer a torment?
Why does my heart not leap up when he arrives?
The sound of the elevator's approach no longer thrills me.
Hélène!
It's a horrible discovery, but I wish to be frank.
My heart is drifting away from you.
I'm ready for your reproaches, bitterness and insults.
I've called myself the worst names already.
Only one insult could wound me now: "hypocrite."
Hélène, you're wonderful.
You were the first to speak, but I was guilty first.
The story of your love is exactly the story of my own.
All you thought, I thought as well.
I kept silent, suffering.
What a lesson you've taught me!
Really?
Really.
Hélène, you're beautiful. You're stunning.
It's like I'm seeing you for the first time.
We should congratulate ourselves.
It would have been awful if one went on loving longer than the other.
Yes, awful.
What now?
Neither of us has betrayed the other.
We can avoid a messy breakup.
We'll continue to see each other.
We'll elude the death throes of a languishing love.
No deceit, no surprises, no disgust.
We'll be unique among our kind.
You take back your freedom, and you give me mine.
We each go our own way.
We'll be each other's confidant, though I doubt I'll find anyone to confide in you about.
You've set such a high standard.
Can anyone ever know the future?
I may soon find you were the only woman capable of making me happy.
Perhaps you'll feel the same.
And one day we'll meet again, and I'll be at your side until we die.
What if you don't find me when you return?
Anything's possible.
I might fall for another. He couldn't compare to you, but still -
That would be nobody's fault.
Good night, Hélène.
Good night, Jean.
Take all the calls. I'm not home for anybody.
Anybody?
Anybody.
I'll have my revenge.
Agnès, darling, you look awful.
Thanks. Always such cheerful news.
I say what I think.
Hurry up.
For those morons?
Morons who wait for you and send such lovely flowers.
Leave them alone.
You're so tense.
We must take them home.
I hate potted flowers.
Especially when a drunkard sends them!
You're mad!
No, I'm not.
You're very ill-tempered this evening.
Sorry, Mama. I'm not angry, just tired.
Follow that car.
Yes, ma'am, it's me.
Hélène! What are you doing here?
Come with me.
You deserve a good scolding.
Not a word from you in three years.
I thought we no longer existed for you.
I might say the same of you.
It's Agnès' fame that led me to you.
Otherwise I'd never have found you.
You know about our troubles?
I suspected.
Financial ruin upon arriving in Paris.
This enormous apartment, and me clinging like a fool to my dwindling furniture.
My dressers, consoles, cupboards, chandeliers - everything I'd brought from the country.
May God keep you from poverty, Hélène.
And Agnes?
An angel!
She's resigned to it.
Her life was dancing, but this was not her dream.
She wanted to live for dancing, not dance to earn us a living.
In the blink of an eye she gave up on all her true talents - the opera, fame...
She's a success.
Leave me alone!
Enough! This is my home!
Agnes! My little girl!
I'm no little girl! I'm a whore!
Leave me alone!
My God, my God!
I'm so distraught.
I heard nothing. I see and hear only what I wish to.
And I was so happy to see you again!
Come on.
What a disaster!
It's over. All over.
What are you saying?
Nothing is over.
I'm here. No one can help us anymore.
I'm just in time then. Let me handle it.
It's hopeless.
It's not hopeless. It's very simple.
Please, calm down.
I can't go on.
You're going to have a decent life. I'll see to that.
Why would you care about women like us?
That girl cannot remain in this mess. I must intervene.
First, you must leave this mess behind and find a less dangerous way of life.
But we can't.
Agnes must stop showing herself off in public.
You'll sell the rest of your furniture, flee this house and its intruders, and I'll see to your new home.
I have debts.
I'll take care of them.
You won't see anyone at first.
People will find us.
If you don't want them to, they won't.
Use your real name again. Take up your old lifestyle.
Erase three years from your history. It won't be hard.
Please, not a word of thanks! Just follow my advice.
You're an angel.
We are all angels.
Obey me and don't worry.
You'll leave here tomorrow.
Now calm down and get some rest.
Don't bother seeing me out.
Agnes!
What a gloomy place!
A piano!
I'm not supposed to dance, but we have music.
No one's stopping you. Dance!
Are you sure all this is necessary?
If so, I accept it, but do you realize what we're in for?
I do. Our life was a nightmare.
And this is a dream?
Look.
I call this a prison.
Trees!
You have a lovely view of the square.
Am I allowed to look outside?
Now don't forget our agreement:
You mustn't thank me.
The Bois de Boulogne at 3:00 this afternoon.
Don't wander far from the waterfall, and be on time.
Agnes must be bored staying in all the time.
She'll be glad to get out.
At the waterfall. Precisely.
I'm going out, but I'll be back for lunch. There'll be two of us.
So, you're shutting yourself in?
You have a secret. Tell me.
We said we would tell each other everything.
People bore me.
Even Jacques?
I don't want to see him.
You still love me.
Perhaps.
And you behave like a saint.
Perhaps.
Now I believe you're capable of any heroism.
I can be heroic if I must.
But why do you live so alone?
So removed from everything?
You are made to be loved and admired.
Use your charms - not just your feminine charms, but that magical charm of yours.
It's no use, dear Jean.
My heart is at peace.
I never thought our friendship would make me so happy.
Please don't let our separation condemn you to a life of solitude.
So, you recommend Jacques?
Is that your advice as a friend?
As a friend.
You're mine for the afternoon. I'm taking you out for a stroll.
And I'm taking you to a show.
On such a sunny day? !
I'd hate to be cooped up in the dark.
We'll go for a stroll, then.
Where?
Anywhere.
The Bois de Boulogne?
Faces from the past.
They were my neighbors in the country three years ago.
I'd like you to meet one of my dearest friends.
What do you think of her?
I hardly looked at her.
You looked at her quite a bit.
She has a striking face.
She looks more like a country lass than a Parisian girl.
It's her gaze that I like.
Yes.
She looks you straight in the eye, yet in a shy way.
You know, I was tempted to leave you and drive them home.
Phone.
Hello?
We just got in.
What?
Happy?
You're happy?
So are we, my dear.
See you soon.
Hélène is happy.
About what?
Not long ago, tea time would have sent you running.
Only to avoid your babbling lady friends.
But there are other women...
Have you seen the ladies from the Bois again?
Why, no.
What a shame!
You should see them again, invite them over, help them.
You like my ladies from the Bois?
They're unlike the ladies you usually associate with.
Very perceptive of you.
They're so unlike them that they refuse to come when I invite them.
Why?
Out of tact and scruples.
Are they so poor?
They went very quickly from wealth to destitution and found simple contentment.
They surprise me.
I admire them.
Do you think I could see them, entertain them?
Certainly not.
You have no idea what that girl is like.
No idea at all.
She is beyond anyone's reach.
You can't touch her nor tempt her. You'd get nowhere.
If I were to go, would they throw me out?
You? Go to Port-Royal Square?
Port-Royal Square?
Of course they would.
I should just give up the whole idea?
That would be wise.
My dear Jean, be careful with your whims. You're flirting with disaster.
I'd rather warn you than console you.
See you tomorrow?
See you tomorrow.
The gentleman forgot his gloves. I'll return them to him tomorrow.
He won't be back tomorrow.
I'm in luck.
I'm not. Leave me alone!
The waterfall at the Bois de Boulogne - have you forgotten?
Was that you at the waterfall? I had forgotten.
I'm so happy. I was certain I'd find you.
Certain?
Since we met, I've felt attached to you by a string. I simply followed it.
Is that string called indiscretion?
No. Certainty.
I must go.
So soon?
Do you like rain that much?
Is it raining?
The rain goes on and on.
Yes, on and on.
Where are you going?
To get an umbrella.
For whom?
You. Don't bother!
I hoped I could say hello to your mother.
What a pity! She's out. Take her umbrella.
Her umbrella?
Take it.
You're not going down again!
I insist.
I won't damage it. I'll bring it back.
Don't bother. Keep it. It's old and has soaked up many a storm.
A souvenir?
Give it to our mutual friend from the Bois.
Will you see her soon?
I rarely see her. And you?
Once a year.
We don't see anybody.
And I'll thank you to remember that.
Follow your string now, and don't lose your way.
Why the long face?
You wouldn't understand.
Understand what?
You lend an umbrella -
It's not the umbrella! I
I didn't break all ties with our former life because it was a jumble of poverty and empty luxuries.
I broke ties with it because I needed to live and enjoy living.
Those flowers ruin everything.
But they bring joy, my angel.
There was a time when I would see a man's face behind every bouquet.
Now look.
Behind these flowers, there's still a man's face threatening us.
That's what we've come to.
You're always so dramatic.
Yesterday our door would open to any man and - flowers!
Today, it closes in their face and - flowers!
Tomorrow there'll be more.
We'll refuse.
Yet I'm still the same girl.
You shouldn't have lent him that umbrella.
I didn't /end it to him. I forbade him to return it.
But it was my umbrella!
I'm sorry, Mama.
But believe me, I had to.
That's all right.
Forget about it. - If only I could.
And be simple.
Simple?
Yes, simple, like me.
I take things as they come.
I ask of things only what they wish to give.
These flowers give me their perfume, and I breathe it in.
Going out?
Where?
To recover our peace of mind.
You're crazy!
I want what's happening to be clear.
Agnès, what is it?
We've been found out.
What a mess. Tell me about it.
Can't you guess?
Someone I know?
Then I can guess.
He was waiting for me in front of our place.
I was on my way home. He escorted me to my door.
We're at the flower stage now and expecting his visit soon.
You shouldn't have received him the first time.
I sent him away.
It was raining. Was I right to do so?
I approve.
Sincerely?
Sincerely.
He'll come back. What should I do?
Show him the door.
Take my advice.
You understand how difficult it was for my mother and me to turn away a friend of yours without consulting you.
I understand. But I will help you.
Help me?
In any way I can.
I'm such a fool.
Why?
I was afraid.
Afraid of what?
Afraid, that's all.
I was ill at ease. I imagined you giving out our address to anyone.
In my mind you were indifferent to our problems, preoccupied solely with your own existence.
I was so foolish.
Do you feel better now? You trust me?
Yes, I do. - Good.
Now sit down. You're going to write a letter.
To whom?
To me.
To you?
! It'll be easy. We'll write it together.
Where have you been? No one's seen you for days.
I've just had a fascinating experience.
I walked along the Seine, and I tried to count up to a thousand between bridges.
If I went beyond a thousand, I turned around and counted more slowly.
Climbing the stairs I told myself,
If I reach the landing on my left foot, I'm lost."
Luckily, I landed on the right.
And what drives you to these kinds of activities?
Despair.
Despair?
I must speak even if I hurt you.
I'm ill. I can't be without her.
I managed to see her again.
Whom?
The girl from the Bois.
I found their haven, thanks to you.
Me? Did I give you the address?
Not you. Your mouth.
Sometimes our mind lets words slip from our tongue unheeded.
In other words, you made a blunder.
If 1 did, I apologize.
You must do me a favor.
What?
The ladies from the Square turn me away.
They never go out, and they receive no one.
Hélène, that girl is wonderful. I must see her again.
You must give me this one chance.
I'll think about it on one condition:
You must quit harassing them with your advances.
You're causing me trouble.
If you need proof... here is the letter.
It's from Agnès. Read it.
Her writing is so like her.
Without pretense. Childlike and noble.
This is like Cinderella's slipper.
If I found a letter like this in the street,
I'd do everything in my power to find the girl who wrote it.
That's your only reaction?
I'll leave them alone, I promise.
But you must give me your word you'll let me see them again.
What are you dragging me into?
Why put me in such an impossible position?
How is it my business whether you love her or you don't?
Work out the affairs of your heart on your own.
Can you imagine the consequences of my kindness if those kind women knew I was helping carry out your whims?
Hélène, you don't understand.
This is no mere whim.
I love you too much to involve you in a meaningless love affair.
No, Hélène.
I love her.
I'm losing my head. I'm capable of anything.
Agnes' face is like a gash across my heart.
I meet her in my dreams and dream of her in my waking hours.
I walk the streets thinking of ways to break down her door, to storm the barriers she's erected, to scream out the pain I feel.
And when I've tired myself out, I turn to counting.
Trees, cracks in the sidewalk, lampposts. I'm going mad.
How you must love her!
So recently cured of love, and now you'll do anything to go mad again?
When will I see her again?
And you're proud of it!
When will I see her again?
I don't know.
I wish you'd stop playing that piano!
I thought my music would soothe your pain.
You won't let me see her?
You're crazy, my dear. There's no cure for you.
There is, but you won't give it to me.
It isn't that I won't.
I can't.
Jean!
Let me leave.
Why are you leaving?
I don't like the piano.
What are you going to do?
Disappear where?
Never see her or you or anyone ever again.
This is all so absurd.
You'll come by one evening. I'll arrange for you to see her here.
Could it really be?
I'm as crazy as you are.
You still have a terrible hold over me... and it frightens me.
You can make them see me?
No.
But I can give chance a hand.
Give me some time.
No, it must be soon.
Tomorrow!
Tomorrow...
You're another person when you dance.
You light up like a chandelier.
I'm about to put out that chandelier. I'm giving up dancing.
What now?
I've decided to quit dancing and dressing up.
I need to put it all behind me.
Agnes!
Agnes!
Agnes!
Agnès, my little girl.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
Nothing? I thought you were dead.
Nothing at all.
I'll never dance again.
It was my heart.
Telephone.
The telephone.
I'll go. No, I will.
Be reasonable and go lie down.
This evening?
Yes, of course, my dear.
Certainly, with pleasure.
We're invited to Héléne's.
Agnès is here. Speak to her.
I'd be delighted. See you tonight.
Will it be just us?
Of course.
It's a joy for us to be here. We live like savages at our place.
Are you blaming me?
Not at all.
Mother only meant it's delightful of you to have us over alone.
You know very well I wouldn't dream of introducing you to anyone.
I promised.
Good evening, Hélène.
I just dropped in for dinner, but I see I'm interrupting.
Yes, you are.
But since you're here, you might as well stay.
You know everyone. Have a seat.
We forgive you.
Call first next time. You mustn't just show up on a whim.
It must be lovely to live by your whims, to have a string that always leads you to the right place.
Very lovely.
My daughter and I take this opportunity to thank you for your flowers.
The house is full of them.
It looks like a greenhouse. Like a dream!
Agnès was delighted. She was -
I think broken glasses -
You said it at the same time.
Make a wish. Yes, let's. I've made mine.
And I mine.
Wouldn't it be funny if we made the same wish?
Find a woman who would do as much for you as I have.
What a disaster!
Disaster?
! - I mean dinner.
The awkwardness, the restraint, the uneasiness.
Their hasty escape.
It was adorable.
Still crazy?
More than ever.
I have to have that girl!
And perhaps you will.
But how?
We'll see.
I know her, my dear Jean.
It's quite clear.
Agnes, will you kindly explain your behavior?
That boy is charming.
So unlike the others we've met.
You must admit he's something else.
Why the long face and the broken glasses?
Why leave in such a hurry?
Why embarrass Hélène like that?
It was quite uncalled for.
Good night, dear.
Are you crying?
Leave me alone.
I never want to see Hélène or him again.
You were busy eating and drinking, but I saw through it all.
All what?
It's impossible to explain.
I prefer not to understand. It'd be worse if I did.
Promise never to see Hélène or accept anything from her again.
I'm afraid that's impossible, darling.
She plays with men, and she's playing with us.
Men are fools. Too bad for him!
Promise me.
Without her we'd be out on the street.
I know it, and so does she.
It's tragic.
Destiny is tragic, but I prefer a fate we choose to one forced upon us.
What's sad is I can't do anything anymore.
I had a career once.
Don't torment yourself.
You have so many ways of making yourself and others happy.
Make whom happy?
I'm thinking of you, my angel. Now go to sleep.
Don't give it any more thought. I'll fight this battle alone.
Oh, it's you. I knew it.
I had to come.
I'm sorry, but I can't ask you in.
Come in.
My daughter will be back soon. She mustn't find you here.
Can't I see her?
No, she mustn't even suspect you came by.
Our place is very small.
So this is where she lives and sleeps.
She plays piano here, and she sits and reads over there.
The lamp is her.
These flowers are her.
This cushion, this frame - it's all her.
Yes, it is. I see I'll have to show you everything.
Her room.
Agnes" room.
Her books.
Her pictures.
Agnès at age five... and ten.
On horseback at 16.
What's that?
A costume.
She likes to dress up?
She used to.
She liked dresses, hats, and jewels, but she does without them now.
With your permission, I'd love to give her a present from time to time without her knowing.
She'd never accept.
She wouldn't have to know where they came from. You'd give them to her.
We'll see. She detects the slightest lie.
Now please go.
May I at least leave this letter for her?
No, no letters. Go quickly!
Mama, we are saved!
From what?
From Hélène and everybody.
I found a job.
What's the matter?
Nothing. A real job!
It's a surprise. Let's go tell Hélène. I can't wait.
Mama, something's wrong.
It's nothing, I tell you.
Somebody looked through my things!
I was tidying up. Your costume fell down.
And what's this?
Even if you never come,
I will wait for you every day at the waterfall."
Agnès, tell me about your job.
What kind of work is it exactly?
Are you sure no one will recognize you if you work in public?
Don't be rash, Agnes.
I'm not being rash, Mama.
Shall I lock you in?
Please, just give me a second.
Do those men frighten you?
Isn't there another exit?
No, and they're not leaving.
I know. They've been watching for you since this morning.
The price of fame.
What fame?
They want autographs.
Come on, everyone knows you.
The whole store is talking about it. They know you're a dancer.
What's wrong?
It's hopeless.
There's no way out of this.
Explain it to me, Mama. I don't understand.
Is there nothing more to life than carrying the burden of one's past mistakes?
It's not fair.
Someone recognized you. I told you.
Always "'I told you"!
There's no hope. I give up.
But we can't go back to that horrible life that you hated.
Men are vicious!
Not all of them.
Whom are you referring to?
You're so impatient! Like a bull at a gate.
You decide this, decide that. You rush into things.
Just let things be.
Look.
What's this?
Put them on.
Where did they come from?
Put them on and look at yourself in the mirror.
You think it's not having fine things that makes me unhappy.
See how beautiful you are.
It's not the lack of fine things that makes me unhappy.
If they were real pearls, I'd throw them out the window.
Hello, Agnès.
What lovely pearl earrings!
I recognize them from my jeweler's shop. I noticed he had sold them recently.
I knew I'd find you wearing them.
You've got it wrong.
Should someone your age be wearing such expensive jewelry?
Take them off right now.
You're hopeless.
How could you? - You've got it wrong.
You're behaving like a tramp.
A horrible little tramp!
Send these pearls back where they came from with a curt note.
How can Agnès behave so foolishly and inappropriately?
You must keep an eye on her, my dear.
Stop her from doing these things.
Don't destroy everything I've built.
Don't tear apart what's taken such effort to put together.
How can you allow your daughter to be treated like a tramp?
That's what you do when you allow her to accept gifts like that.
But I suppose it's my fault.
I ask you to live like hermits, and I'm sure it must be very dreary.
If this life seems a bit oppressive, why don't you tell me?
You must recognize I've helped you and that we've almost achieved our goal.
Yes.
Then help me to help you.
And warn me when that little fool does anything stupid.
You promise?
Yes, Hélène.
I think you're right. I promise.
I'm not the courageous type.
I'm writing to tell you what I'd never dare say in person.
And yet -"
Where are you going?
Where are you going? Answer me!
I'm sure she's up to something foolish.
She hasn't been the same since yesterday.
I told you to watch her.
You asked for it.
Asked for what?
The worst... for you.
Where is she?
If I knew, we'd try to save her.
No doubt she's outdoing herself this time.
She'll end up ruining everything.
I've waited every day, but I never thought you'd come.
I didn't come to meet you but to give you this letter.
A letter?
Is it bad news? - Very bad.
Then I don't want it.
Please read it. I insist.
I'll tear it up.
No!
We're unlucky. Every time we meet alone, it's raining.
Come. Let's get out of the rain.
So, you live in this cave? How odd.
I've only a moment to tell you so much.
Let's make this moment last forever.
We can do it.
We can make it last an entire lifetime, Agnès.
You're not saying no? I don't frighten you?
Tell me this isn't some absurd dream.
Tell me you're putting up barriers between us that don't really exist.
That everything is clear and simple, and nothing separates us.
Read this letter.
We'll read it together one day, in the sun.
There's a train at 7:00 waiting to take us away.
We just have time.
Take a cab and meet me at the station.
Gare de Lyon at 7:00!
Where are you going?
Where have you been?
Did you tell him everything?
I told him nothing.
You love him!
My dear friend, you are very foolish.
I told you your idea was doomed. These women are impeccable.
Yes, I am foolish. You were right.
Now you spend your whole life waiting - on stairways, in caves, at train stations.
What about your work?
I can't work.
I can't talk to anyone anymore.
I can't read or write or live anymore.
I haven't a shred of will left.
I'm a walking ghost.
I wish I could just sleep.
Sometimes I feel like driving in my car until I fall asleep and crash.
I wouldn't advise traveling. You'd drive 20 miles and turn back.
My dear, we've come -
Actually, Agnès didn't want to come, but I'm sure that in your kindness you'll understand me.
It's a very serious and delicate matter that has me quite upset.
I hesitate to mention it as you've always been very good to us.
It's only our long-standing friendship that allows me to speak.
Excuse me.
Hello?
Speaking.
Go, then, my dear friend.
What?
! I'm not helping you?
That's all I'm doing, helping you.
It's true.
What do you expect me to do?
Then go!
I don't understand a word you're saying.
You've shown how fond you are of us, and I'm sure we can come to understand each other.
I don't know if we are of use to you in any way-
Not in the slightest!
Agnès is going through a difficult time. I'd like us to help her.
We feel obligated to have your consent before we do anything.
Consent?
We are in debt to you, and it weighs heavily on Agnès.
I'd like to hear you say she's free.
Free?
I set you both totally free.
But you're hardly free, since you're practically married.
Married?
You're such an odd one, my dear Agnes.
You drive a man mad - what do you expect me to do?
You must choose: Marry him or tell him everything.
Or shall I tell him?
Mama, let's go.
Marriage is out of the question.
I won't do it.
Why?
If I accepted this horrible solution, where would it lead?
He would find out everything. No one would think twice about telling him.
People aren't criminals, Agnes.
Be a woman. Fight!
Don't spoil your life forever.
You'll tell him afterward.
Things will change then.
In any case, you no longer have a choice.
Let's go.
How many miles?
Sixty, round trip.
Well?
My mind is made up for good.
God knows you and I are not the marrying kind.
Oh, leave me out of this.
Could you see yourself getting married?
Yes, and today I can tell you that.
But there's only one man I would marry.
Who?
You.
You disapprove of my marriage?
She's perfect for you. You're very lucky.
I'm so glad to hear you say that.
And after all I've asked of you, I'd like to ask for one final favor that should be no trouble at all.
I put my fate in your hands.
Tell them of my intentions. I don't think they'll need much convincing.
Not so fast, my dear Jean.
This isn't about them. It's about you.
I must know more about this.
I don't want you rushing into some new adventure.
You said they were impeccable.
Of course they are.
If things work out, I'm at their disposal.
They seem to prefer to avoid people.
If they like, we can have a simple wedding.
On the contrary.
I envision a huge wedding.
Let me organize it. I'll take care of everything.
But I repeat: Slow down.
No, make it as quickly as possible.
I could never do enough for your happiness.
I'm afraid I was completely wrong about that girl.
I'm afraid for you.
Look at people's expressions.
Ask some questions.
About what? And whom should I ask?
Agnes.
Where's Agnès?
I don't know.
Come along.
Come!
I can't face them or anyone anymore.
Come along.
Kill me, but don't drag me out there.
Let go.
Do what you like with me. I deserve it.
But I beg of you -
Let go! Hélène has told you everything, and now that you know -
I know nothing and wish to know nothing! You hear me?
Madame has fainted. Look after her.
Hélène!
Hélène!
You look upset. What's wrong?
What is this horrible mystery I'm involved in?
I don't understand a thing.
Please tell me. Don't be afraid of hurting me. I'm going crazy!
It's quite simple.
You've married a tramp.
She was a cabaret dancer.
You played a trick on me, and now I've played one on you.
You? !
Yes, me.
You don't seem to realize where a woman's scorn can lead.
You? !
You? !
Don't be absurd.
You've married a tramp. Now you must face the consequences.
You're suddenly so sentimental.
You're horrid!
Since your marriage seems to mean so much to you, you mustn't run off.
Return to Agnes' side.
You won't be the only one to console her. All her lovers are inside.
And there are plenty of them!
She's very ill. She's fainted three times.
Her heart may fail any minute.
I'm very worried. We must do something.
Please, madame, let me by.
You're here.
In time perhaps you'll forgive me.
But don't hurry.
So many honest girls become dishonest women.
Perhaps I'll show the opposite can happen.
I'm not yet worthy to have you come close to me.
Wait.
Just leave me a little hope.
Then you can judge my behavior.
I'll be happy if you can bear my presence.
Show me a corner of your house where I can live.
I'll stay there without protest.
I'm not evil.
I know myself.
I was weak.
And I was in love with you - that's my only excuse.
I lacked the courage to tell you the truth.
Remember the letter you wouldn't read?
It wasn't pleasant.
You can forget me.
I won't trouble you anymore.
It will be easy.
Agnes!
Agnes!
Hold on to life with all your strength.
Hold on to me!
I love you. You can't leave me!
Try to hold on! Fight!
I am fighting.
You're my wife. I love you.
Stay with me!
I'll try.
That's an order. You can't disobey!
Stay with me!
I will stay.
THE CHILDREN OF PARADISE
PART ONE "THE BOULEVARD OF CRIME"
Old clothes to buy.
Step right up. Truth is here.
Come in and see her.
Once you've seen her, she will fill your thoughts, haunt your dreams.
Totally unadorned, naked for all to see.
You can pay as you leave.
Our show is enticing.
Audacious. Arousing.
For those with eyes to see.
For lovers of beauty.
Step right up, gentlemen.
None of your "Stage door, please."
You can't fool me.
You bluff your way in to catch the show for free and from a box seat.
It's the manager I want to see.
The manager. Is that so?
What do you want from him?
It's simple. I want to see him... so he hires me.
Hire you. And why not put your name on the marquee?
In great big letters.
Why not, Mr. Still Life?
Hey, you.
Yes, I see it, foresee it.
My name up there in huge letters.
Frédérick... Frédérick Lemaitre.
Etch that on your feeble, doddering memory.
Remember the name.
Look.
Not bad. You know her?
Not yet.
You smiled. Don't deny it.
How marvelous. Isn't life beautiful.
And you're just like it, you're beautiful, too.
You've been running.
Yes. After you.
After me? But you ran toward me.
Yes. I saw you a moment ago.
The shock. The emotion.
Before I could move, you were gone. So...
So?
So as I hate to follow a woman,
I ran ahead so I could meet you face to face.
Now I'll never leave you. Which way?
That's simple.
You go your way, I go mine.
They may be the same.
And why not?
I have a rendezvous.
Rendezvous?
O Cruel Fate.
Together for two minutes and you're leaving me already.
Why? For another, of course.
And you love this other?
I love everyone.
I don't mind, I'm not jealous.
But this "other" is.
How do you know?
All men are... except me.
But let's talk about us. We have so much to say.
Do we?
Yes, we do.
First, my name. Frédérick.
Now tell me yours.
They call me Garance.
Garance. How lovely.
It's a ﬂower.
A red ﬂower, like your lips?
Well?
Well, good-bye... Frédérick.
You can't abandon me, all alone on the Boulevard of Crime.
When will I see you again?
Soon, maybe.
Chance will tell.
Paris is so big.
Paris is so small for such great lovers as we.
You smiled, don't deny it.
How marvelous. isn't life beautiful.
PUBLIC SCRIBE
My love, light of my life, time weighs on my heart like chains on a convict's limbs.
Come back, I beg you.
Never again, I swear...
Yes, I solemnly swear never to raise my hand against you, as I once did."
Will that do?
Will it? it's grand, moving.
If that don't bring her back, nothing will.
Poor fool.
You gotta admit, it's swell.
What is?
Being educated.
My poor Avril.
Honest, Mr. Lacenaire.
How d'you find the words?
Enough nonsense.
Down to business.
Have you the silverware?
It's sterling.
Sterling, indeed.
Spoons today. Clocks yesterday.
Here's my guardian angel.
I'll see you tonight.
Out of your well, my angel, my sweet?
The well's over with. And so is the Truth.
So soon?
The customers got too demanding.
Truth, but only from the neck up.
They were disappointed.
Those good people wanted more.
The whole truth." I understand them. The costume must suit you.
Maybe, but it's always the same.
How modest. How chaste.
It's not that.
They're just so ugly.
Ugly, indeed.
I'd like to stamp them all out.
Still cruel, Pierre-François?
I'm not cruel, I'm logical.
I declared war on society long ago.
Any recent victims?
None, my angel. See? No trace of blood.
Just some ink stains.
But I'm planning something grandiose.
You're wrong to smile. Truly, I'm not like other men.
My heart doesn't beat like theirs. Absolutely not.
Have you ever been humiliated?
Never
Nor I. But they've tried.
Beyond the limit for a man like me.
As a child, I was more lucid and clever than the others.
They never forgave me.
I had to be like them, talk like them.
Lift your head, Pierre-François.
Eyes down."
They crammed my mind with books.
Old books.
So much dust in a child's head.
A fine childhood.
My worthy mother favored my dim brother.
My confessor would say,
You are too proud. Withdraw into yourself."
So I withdrew into myself.
And there I remained.
The fools. Leaving me alone with myself, yet warning me against bad company.
How thoughtless.
But what a splendid destiny.
To love no one. To be alone.
To be loved by no one.
To be free.
True, I love no one.
Not even you, Garance.
But you are the only woman for whom I have no contempt.
I don't love you either.
That's fortunate.
Then why these daily visits?
Because I don't demand what all other men do?
You're no coquette. So why?
I'm bored.
Do I amuse you?
Yes, you talk all the time. It's like watching a play.
It's entertaining and relaxing.
You don't take me seriously.
If I were vain, I'd be deeply offended.
But I have no vanity, only pride.
And I'm sure of myself. Absolutely sure.
Thief by need, murderer by calling, my path is charted out.
I'll Walk with my head high... until it drops... into the basket.
My father used to say, "You'll end up on the guillotine."
You're right. Always listen to your parents.
Still writing plays?
In my idle moments.
Misconduct." A tragedy?
No, a slightly ribald farce.
I loathe tragedy.
Such an inferior genre.
Characters who kill one another, yet never get hurt.
How depressing.
Here comes Judgment Day.
It's Jupiter.
Alias Jericho, because of my horn.
Alias Medusa, because of my gaze.
Greetings, Lacenaire.
My respects to Beauty.
What do we have today?
How much?
I have no secrets from the lady.
My compliments.
Don't mention it.
How much?
Twenty francs.
You're joking.
Remember, they call me the Tightwad, the Niggard, the Rat, cause I scavenge...
like a rat.
Step right up, ladies and gentlemen.
A franc for the boxes if you're well-to-do, four centimes in the Gods if you're badly off.
Come in and see...
Perils of the Virgin Forest" or "Crime and Virtue."
A pantomime that's magic, exotic, pyrotechnic.
Come in and see a girl of 15 pursued by a mountain lion.
A forest fire.
An abduction by balloon.
And you shall see me, the one and only, the incomparable Anselme Deburau.
I who performed in the harem before the Grand Turk and his 82 Turkesses.
But inside you won't see - have no fear - this one here.
Because he's a know-nothing.
A dolt.
A sleepwalker... even sitting down.
An unbelievable nincompoop.
A deplorable blockhead.
An utter good-for-nothing.
And this, alas, is my son.
Here sits the shame of an artistic family, a famous father's despair, the cause of his gray hair.
When I say my son, luckily I exaggerate.
One night - it was a full moon - he fell from above... into a bucket.
When I got home it was already too late.
But I won't wash dirty linen in public.
The show's about to begin. A unique show.
For the penny-pinchers, the tightfisted, the miserly, or the parsimonious... the management, sparing no expense, leaves them Baptiste, free of charge.
Say, Baptiste, if you have pups, save me one.
He really looks stupid, doesn't he?
I think he has nice eyes.
Nice eyes.
That deserves a hand.
My watch.
Someone stole my watch. My gold watch.
She did it. It had to be you.
Thief!
Let go of me. You're crazy.
And she insults me. Thief! Police!
Officer! Someone!
What's going on?
This gent had a watch, now he doesn't. And he blames me.
Why? A mystery to me.
Naturally, you're innocent.
As a lamb.
Are you sure of this?
Absolutely. Arrest her.
It wasn't me.
So you say.
Any witnesses?
Me.
I'm a witness.
What did you see?
The whole thing.
What do you have to say now?
Why, nothing.
I'm sorry. Anybody can make an error.
An error of justice.
May I go now?
You're free.
Fine, because I adore freedom.
You're on next.
What are you sniggering about?
Artists don't laugh here, the audience does.
Here's Jericho, alias the Trumpet, alias the Flask, for my drinking, alias Woe-ls-Me, for my hard lot.
Greetings, stage manager.
Here are the props:
a hunting horn, a royal blue tunic, three skulls, gold epaulettes, patent leather shoes and a wedding gown.
Interested, Nathalie?
It's contagious. Another pillar of salt.
Love cheers the heart.
Same old story?
Her father against it?
He wants what she wants. No, it's that dunce.
He should count his blessings.
I'll have to do something.
It's no business of yours.
They also call me The Spark, The Stoker, The Dove-keeper, because I like to unite turtledoves.
How now, my lovely. Show us your palm.
An amazing fate line.
Oh, fate and me...
Don't be silly.
It says here it will all work out.
Take it from a wise old pappy.
You'll marry the one you love.
Do you think so?
It's plain to see.
And when you set up house, remember old pappy has sterling silverware at a reasonable price.
Sorry to interrupt your daydream, but I'm looking for the manager.
Is it important?
I'm warning you, the manager's in a foul mood.
Then I'll try him another day.
But he's in a foul mood every day.
Well, then, I'll try my luck.
Wait here.
What a charming playhouse.
What a fine profession.
It would be, if it fed us properly.
Speak to me." About nothing, probably.
This fop here? You're on.
Young man?
Remember, post the fines. "Seraphin, two francs:
On-stage drunk and swearing."
What's got into them?
They sense a storm brewing.
You can't imagine. My theater is torn by hatred and jealousy.
We perform on a volcano.
This isn't pantomime, it's a vendetta, a corrida.
They're worse than the Horatii and the Curiatti.
Worse than...
The Montagues and the Capulets.
Never heard of them.
It's Shakespeare. Romeo...
Don't know him.
Alas, few know and appreciate Shakespeare.
Who knows you? Who appreciates you?
What do you want?
I keep asking you.
What I want...
I want to act.
Act. Act.
You've got the wrong theater. We're not allowed to act here.
We walk on our hands.
I can do that.
And you know why?
They bully us. Why? They fear us.
If we put on plays, they'd have to close their great, noble theaters.
Their public is bored to death by museum pieces, dusty tragedies and declaiming mummies who never move.
But the Funambules is full of life and movement.
Extravaganzas. Appearances, disappearances, like in real life.
And then...
Wham. The kick.
Wham. The slapstick... like in real life.
And the audience.
Sure, they're poor, but they're pure gold.
Look, up there in the Gods.
Watch out, the old fogey.
The king of the desert.
Shut up! We can't hear the pantomime.
He hit him too hard.
Did he?
You animal.
You snake.
You'll pay for this.
Friends, he dared strike Anselme Deburau.
Help, Barrignis.
Curtain!
Fine everyone 3 francs.
Pull them apart. Curtain.
Stop this instant.
It's shameful.
What's shameful is a lowly Barrigni striking a Deburau, like a traitor, and in public.
I demand an apology.
Yes, an apology.
Apologize, and on with it. The audience is losing patience.
A Barrigni never apologizes.
We're leaving for a better offer across the Boulevard.
You're not serious.
To work for Saqui?
Yes, right this minute.
Come, Barrignis.
This is a fatal blow. A conspiracy. A disaster.
Stage manager, a chair.
O Deceit. Treachery. They stabbed me in the back.
Curtain! Curtain!
What a disaster. Listen to them.
My dear audience. Refund!
How's that?
Refund?
Never. I'd rather... I don't know... anything.
Or anyone. I'm your man: I'm anyone.
I'll slip into my character's skin and show my stuff.
But I don't know you.
Where have you played?
What parts have you done?
Lion parts.
I've done the whole lion repertoire:
Gulf of Lions, Richard the Lion-Hearted, Pygma-lion.
Thieves! Thieves!
Hurry. They'll tear the place up.
The voice of the people. The Christians demand a lion.
Disaster upon disaster.
How much...
Wages, already. No.
How much time on stage?
As little as possible.
I'm warning you: It won't be easy to call me off.
Relax, I know the plot.
Enter Pierrot...
Pierrot.
We lost our Pierrot. Disaster.
What about Baptiste?
Never
Never will my unworthy son tread the boards with me.
They loved him out on the street.
You saw it?
The cashier saw it.
The cashier?
Vox populi.
She's got an infallible eye. She's never a centime off. Get Baptiste.
I protest.
And I command.
Go on.
The Funambules is sinking. The rats are abandoning the ship.
Storm winds blow... the audience howls...
I'm sole captain on board... after God.
I'll make an announcement.
Ladies and gentlemen.
Prepared for any sacrifice, the Funambules Theater is proud to present, for the first time, at no extra charge...
What is it, Baptiste?
Nothing. Why?
Yes, there is something.
You're handsome.
You know you are, because I love you.
Today, you're even more handsome.
You're shining.
What's that ﬂower?
A ﬂower.
A ﬂower.
Are you glad to perform at last?
Perhaps.
I'm happy, too.
I have such faith in you.
Oh, Baptiste, if only you wanted to, we could be so happy together.
But you don't love me.
I know.
You're fond of me.
I don't want your fondness.
I want your love.
Loving is so easy.
You're doing it on purpose.
Or you're in love with someone else.
This ﬂower. What's this ﬂower?
Someone gave it to you?
Who was it?
Answer me, Baptiste.
Remember, you said I was your friend, that you had no secrets from me.
Answer me.
Was it a woman?
Where did you meet her?
Do I know her?
What's her name?
I don't know.
I was gazing into a well.
Others were looking, too.
But only I saw her.
Still dreaming and laughing at me.
It's true.
What more can I say?
I saw her again, by chance. She gave me this ﬂower.
That's all.
Well, it's not much.
And you love her.
Oh, yes, I love her.
How you said that.
My little lambs, you're on next.
You look fine, Baptiste.
A nice touch, the ﬂower. It will get a laugh.
You know the plot:
You love her, she laughs at you.
Play the fool. Nothing to it.
Look alive, children.
This mulled wine is splendid.
It goes down like God in red velvet tights.
To your health, Baptiste.
And to yours, friends.
Remember that tonight you drank with Julius Caesar.
Julius Caesar or another.
Charles the Bold, Attila,
Henri IV, Ravaillac.
Yes, I'm sure of it.
It's my destiny to resuscitate the great men of this earth.
They played their parts. It's my turn now.
Give me my chance.
Rise, Julius Caesar. Frédérick is here.
I'll dust him off, and drag his shadow across the boards.
He'll live again to astonish the world once more.
Thanks to me.
Go ahead and laugh.
I won't end my days at the Funambules in a lion's skin.
A lion who can't even roar.
What torment, when inside me here, there's an entire orchestra, a whole universe.
Words and phrases leave you cold.
You tell your story without speaking.
And you do it so well.
You really astonished me.
You speak with your legs, answer with your hands.
A glance, a shrug, a step forward, back... and they understand in the Gods.
They understand, though they're poor.
I'm like them. I love them, I know them.
Their lives are small, but their dreams are grand.
I don't want only to amuse them.
I want to move them, frighten them, make them weep.
All that without a word?
Without a word.
That's not easy.
Think it's impossible?
Not easy. it's not the same.
Barkeep.
Consider yourself lucky I can pay for a drink.
But not a bed.
Try my place, the Post House.
A hotel?
No, but they let rooms.
On credit?
If not, I'd have to move.
You really don't want the second-ﬂoor ﬂat?
A small room is fine.
What a shame.
It's perfect for a bachelor. It has ﬂower-print curtains.
But I'll show you the rooms upstairs.
I'm sorry it's so late, Madame...
Madame Hermine.
Don't apologize. I usually turn in late.
I often read for hours... in bed.
Love stories, no doubt?
Mr. Baptiste, this young man knows a woman's soft spot.
After you, Monsieur...
No, after you.
Oh, please.
Good night, Frédérick.
Good night, Madame Hermine.
Going out at this hour?
He goes out every night.
A real alley cat, your Mr. Baptiste.
Silent, stealthy as a cat in the night,
He slinks through the shadows towards love's light,
To his beloved, his heart's pyre,
His naked companion, atremble with desire."
How beautiful, Mr. Frédérick.
And slightly...
And slightly?
You'll make me say something silly.
After you, please.
After you.
Here are the rooms.
This one's quite nice.
Yes, quite pleasant, cheerful.
Or if you prefer this one...
It has a double bed.
Yes, I'd prefer that.
A double bed.
Poor Frédérick.
All alone at night in a big bed.
But beds are for sleeping, no matter the size. Not so?
Of course, Mr. Frédérick.
Well, I'll leave you.
Good night.
The key's in the door.
I always leave my door unlocked.
You do?
A pretty lady might wander in.
A pretty lady-"
Young people are so demanding today.
Did I say you were homely?
Alms for a poor blind man.
Why do you tiptoe by?
To avoid giving me anything?
Why won't you give alms to a poor blind man?
Why?
I have no money.
No money?
Hear that, bird?
That's a good one.
Folks strut around with full pockets.
Easy to pick when you can see.
It's not my trade.
His trade.
Hear that, bird?
Hasn't a cent, but he's got a trade.
A fine trade that feeds a man.
A fine trade, even so.
May I sit here a moment?
I've walked a lot and I'm a bit tired.
What are you doing wandering the streets at this hour?
Taking in things.
Hear that, bird?
Taking in what?
Everything-
Say, you're nosy. Too curious, you are.
Say, pilgrim, would your trade be...
Oh, no. Don't worry.
We're not worried.
We just don't like "ﬂies," the bird and me.
So, where do you work?
At the Funambules.
You sell oranges?
No, I perform.
Perform?
Yes, pantomime.
I just love pantomime.
I often go.
You?
Sure, I can't see it, but a friend describes it all.
So that's it.
So you're an actor.
Why didn't you say so? Let's celebrate.
Sure, let's get a drink.
And when I say a drink...
Thank you, but...
Thank me when we're good and drunk.
Let's go, bird.
Your coach is leaving.
We're not going far. It's just around the corner.
The Red Breast."
You're curious, so you're in for a treat.
Shall I lead?
No, thanks. I know the way.
Nice name, eh?
The Red Breast."
On account of the former owner.
He got bled one night behind his bar.
So the name "Red Breast" stuck.
Take a seat. We'll be fine here. This is my place.
Hullo, Silk Thread.
Hullo, Little Louis.
Rotgut and your best grub. I've got a guest.
Something for the bird, too?
Naturally.
Is this gold or imitation?
I'll see.
Gold. You didn't get taken.
Thanks.
Can't believe your eyes, funambulist?
It's quite simple.
Out there, I'm blind. A hopeless case, blind as a bat.
In here, I'm healed. A miracle.
So I do some appraising.
Jewelry, stones, gold.
What d'you say, artist?
Nothing?
You're a wise man.
Never say a thing.
Do you dream about cats?
Do you dream about dogs?
Have you seen troubled waters?
Here's the key to your dreams, bound and illustrated.
Greetings, boss.
Lacenaire's on his way with his merry gang.
Mum's the word.
I get it, thanks.
Here's Jericho, alias the Trumpet, alias the Sandman, alias Sweet Dreams, because he cures nightmares.
Do you dream about snakes, fires, new-born babes?
Believe it or not, Silk Thread, a real collector's item.
Well, I'll be.
You here, Baptiste? In a place like this?
What would Deburau say? And Nathalie?
Don't mention Nathalie.
So gentle, fresh as a rose, pure as a lily.
I won't listen. I don't like you. I don't care about you.
I told you so. Leave me alone.
Hear that, Silk Thread? Try and be helpful...
What I said is for your own good.
Here comes high society.
Greetings, Mr. Lacenaire.
It's wonderful.
What's wonderful?
Everything- Life.
His lawyer tells him not to talk.
But the priest says, "Confession is half remission."
So he confesses.
But the judge says, "You killed and confessed.
Off with your head."
The man, disappointed, protests:
But you said confession was half remission."
But since justice had to be done, they cut off half his head.
That's a good one.
Why so sad and silent, my angel?
Life is beautiful.
Why do you always harp on death?
I only talk about other people's deaths.
Mine is for later.
What can I say? Life is like that.
Philosophers think of death, beautiful women think of love.
So, that makes you all philosophers.
Why not?
How cheerful, charming and neat your philosophy is.
And love is cheerful, charming and neat, perhaps?
A sight better.
I've seen 'em lovesick, but you take the cake.
I'm not one to give advice, but if you want to wake up tomorrow, you'd best leave now.
The former owner... they're the ones who did him in.
I shouldn't tell you.
She doesn't love him. It's obvious she doesn't.
Must you go?
I'm tired and bored.
This is serious. Never have I felt for a woman...
Love, Pierre-François?
Spare me your nonsense.
I desire you, that's all. But I have my pride.
So you want me to make the first move.
Your head's too hot for me, and your heart too cold.
I worry about drafts.
I watch my health.
A pity. We could have done astounding things together.
I'd spill torrents of blood to give you rivers of diamonds.
I'd settle for less.
What a lovely hand.
May I, Lacenaire?
Your future, beauty?
If it amuses you. But I don't believe in it.
I only believe in what I love.
Such as?
Anything, anyone.
Still, if you predict traveling, I wouldn't mind.
That's just what I do see: a journey.
And a long one, too.
To India, maybe?
Why India?
Because it's far away.
The consultation's over, Jericho.
But explain this for me: I dreamed about you.
You were in the street, shouting:
Ragman. Used clothes for sale?"
But in my dream I heard something else:
Rat-on-the-man.
Friends for sale?"
Do you really deal with those "gentlemen" and sell friends?
Lies. As sure as I'm called...
You're called Snitch, Forked Tongue, 13th at Table.
That's spiteful talk.
It's not spite, but I suggest you be more discreet.
You'll betray me, my angel. It's your right.
You're wrong.
You will, my angel. If need be, with my help.
Leave me alone. You tire me.
I came here to have fun, to dance...
Would you dance with me?
How 'bout that, Mr. Lacenaire?
Who is he?
Nobody.
An actor at the Funambules.
An actor.
What a breed.
I see why the Church buried them at night.
I didn't recognize you at first.
But be careful.
They're vicious. Be careful.
I don't care. What could happen to me?
I'm so happy-
How 'bout it, Mr. Lacenaire?
If that's your pleasure.
Let go of him.
What about my window?
Say, owner... can't we have fun... at "The Red Breast"?
I didn't mean to... it's late.
I'll escort you home if you like.
Poor Avril.
What do we do?
Nothing.
Unless someone disagrees.
Lacenaire doesn't complicate his life over a woman.
No great deal, women.
Back to serious matters.
Once a month, bank messengers carry small fortunes.
Attacking them outside is common and risky.
And one might catch cold.
Best to work at home, by appointment.
So I rent an apartment, and when the bank messenger calls...
He gets the message.
You catch on so quickly, Avril.
You don't look that strong.
I'm not strong.
But back there...
I had a rough childhood. I learned how to defend myself.
You were unhappy?
When I was, I slept. I dreamed.
But people don't like that.
So they beat me to wake me up a little.
Luckily, my sleep was heavier than their blows, and I ﬂed them in my sleep.
Yes, I dreamed,
I hoped,
I waited.
For you, maybe.
Even back then?
Why not?
I surely saw you in my dreams.
Stop smiling.
By throwing me that ﬂower you may have awakened me for good.
You're a funny boy.
You're so beautiful.
No, I'm just alive.
The most alive of all.
I'll never forget tonight and the light in your eyes.
Just a glimmer, like everyone else.
Down there, look at the lights of Ménilmontant.
People sleep and wake.
Each has a glimmer that glows and fades.
It's nothing much.
I can't even find the room I lived in with my mother.
In Ménilmontant?
I was born and grew up there, very happily-
Yet Mother was poor and my father left her.
She worked for others as a laundress.
She loved me, I loved her. She was lovely and cheerful.
She taught me how to laugh and sing.
Then she died and everything changed.
You were left alone.
I was 15.
Around here, a girl who grows up too fast isn't alone very long.
Please don't be sad. It pains me.
Me, sad? I'm as happy as a lark.
I love your laugh.
So do I. I'd be lost without it.
And me, without you.
Tell me your name.
You're shaking. Are you cold?
I'm shaking because I'm happy.
Happy because you're here, near me.
I love you.
Garance, do you love me?
You talk like a child.
People love that way in books, in dreams. Not in real life.
Dreams, life... they're the same.
Else life's not worth living.
But it's not life I love. it's you.
You're the nicest boy I've ever met.
I won't forget tonight, either.
I like you.
I love you.
Love is such a simple thing.
A storm.
You'll be soaked.
So what?
You've no coat.
I'll take you back.
Where?
Home.
I don't have a home.
I quit my job The lodging went with it.
I can get you a room where I live.
A room?
Yes, do come.
Don't wake the house for a room.
Where is she?
Coming. Coming.
It's you, Mr. Baptiste. What is it?
Miss...
Excuse me, I was upstairs.
Someone's ill. Nothing serious.
Can I help you?
A room.
She was caught in the rain.
Of course. Caught in the rain.
She's charming.
Take her to room 10.
A good thing I left the key in the door.
Have a good night. And no bad dreams.
You're drenched.
The storm's passed.
I'll hang my dress out to dry.
Turn around if you're embarrassed.
It's not bad here, though it's a bit sad.
Why sad?
It's always sad when you sleep alone.
You can turn around now.
Charming costume.
It's like being in India.
You're so beautiful.
But I must let you sleep.
I'm not very sleepy.
Remember, you could work at the Funambules.
But I can't do anything.
I'll help you. You need work.
Why not? I could show my legs.
The public doesn't ask for much.
But I love you.
Please don't be so solemn. It chills me.
Don't be angry, but I'm not the way you dreamed.
You have to understand me. I'm simple, so simple.
I am what I am. I want to please those I like.
And when I want to say yes, I can't say no.
I prefer moonlight, don't you?
The moon?
Of course, the moon.
My homeland, the moon.
He's not one of us. He's not like us.
One night during a full moon, he fell to Earth.
He dreams of the impossible."
Why "impossible," if I can dream it?
You don't realize how much
I want you to love me the way I love you.
Yet I'll not shed her blood nor scar that whiter skin than snow and smooth as monumental alabaster.
Yet she must die, else she'll betray more men.
Put out the light, and then..."
Yes, let's put out the light.
Good night, Desdemona.
Good night, Othello.
I am a I am
I'm made as you see
When I feel like laughing
I laugh heartily
I love those who love me
Am / really to blame
If the one that I love
Is never the same?
Charming outfit. But I prefer the other one.
A question of taste.
Exactly.
Do you live here?
Of all places to meet.
Paris is so small for such great lovers as we."
You're alone, I hope.
Sadly, all alone. Left to do penance.
Poor Garance.
You're not afraid, all alone at night?
The sun will be up soon. It's an early riser.
And you?
Me.
What does it matter?
If it's up before us, we close the shutters.
And your door, my love, is it locked?
I'm not afraid of thieves. What's there to steal?
The incomparable Baptiste, my own son, his father's pride, is the sole author of the show we present today:
The Palace of illusions" or "Lovers of the Moon."
Unique in the annals of the Funambules Theater, the show, ladies and gentlemen, is in its fourth week, for ever more select audiences, at still reasonable prices.
Only 1.50 francs for a box, 30 centimes in the Gods.
Have you ever seen such a splendid creature?
She's ravishing, simply ravishing.
Now I know where you spend your evenings.
And nights.
Wrong, as usual, Georges.
I've never even met the young lady.
Hard to believe.
Perhaps. But absolutely true.
I haven't dared.
Hey there, Baptiste.
The laurels adorning his father's brow have bloomed overnight on my son's.
A family of prodigies.
And him? isn't he prodigious?
He's clearly gifted.
But he's no mime.
What is he?
An actor.
It's marvelous.
Quite amusing.
How funny.
Those people are amazing, simply amazing.
Someone shouted on stage.
A three-franc fine. Five francs.
Who was it?
My daughter?
Just three francs.
What got into you to yell?
You know it's forbidden. Do you want to shut us down?
Answer me. Why?
I was frightened.
Frightened of what?
Baptiste frightened me.
He frightens me.
You don't understand.
You don't see, you don't feel.
You don't see how he's changed. He's not the same.
The way he looks right through you now, as if he were lost.
Lost forever.
You've lost your wits.
Never has Baptiste been more cheerful and alert.
A father knows best.
You may know him, but I love him, and I see his torment.
And that rope.
That was his idea.
A fine idea, no?
A splendid idea.
The son is worthy of his father.
Mine beat the craft into me, with the motto:
A kick in the butt, if well aimed, makes the whole world laugh.
It's true.
There's an entire order, a science, a style of kicks in the butt.
Alas, traditions die out.
Audiences always want something new.
Something new. Novelty.
What does that mean?
Novelty is as old as the hills.
Distress... That's meaningless.
Are you distressed?
It's not the same.
Why?
Because I have faith.
Faith?
I hope...
I believe one day you'll love me.
You're sweet.
So are you.
We're not to blame for the situation.
But it's so stupid and unfair.
We run in circles, like circus horses.
I love you. You don't love me.
You love Garance.
She loves Frédérick.
How can you say she loves Frédérick?
I don't know. Because they live together.
That proves nothing.
If all couples living together were in love, the earth would glow like the sun.
They don't live together.
They only pretend to live.
Your pantomimes are killing me.
I'm dying of silence, like others die of hunger or thirst.
As a boy in church,
I wanted to speak from the pulpit in the priest's place.
Don"t get angry- You gave me a fright.
I thought you wanted a raise.
I've such expenses. We'll work it out.
You could be the sideshow barker.
That might tide you over.
Sideshow? Why not?
Anything, anywhere, but not dumb shows for deaf-mutes.
I'd rather play a cripple running in the streets, singing ballads.
Or play hospitals for the blind.
Joan of Arc was blissful. She heard voices.
I don't ask for that much.
I'd be glad just to hear my own sometimes.
Sweet nightingale, where have you been?
At last, rose of my days, light of my nights.
My raven-haired blond Isolde. My sweet, gentle Iphigenia.
Let me know when you finish.
Ingrate, you'd still the voice of love itself.
The voice of love.
What's on your mind, lovely sphinx?
Nothing.
A lot of things.
I was thinking that all over the world, there are lovers who make love in silence, or else they use simple words.
I think that's beautiful.
Aren't you happy with me?
You're not happy with me either.
Me?
If you were, would you joke all the time?
If you thought I was happy, would you try so hard to amuse me?
Not happy, not unhappy. We're somewhere in between.
We're not in love. No one's to blame.
All the same, it's nothing to be proud of.
A gentle moonbeam in her pitch-black hair."
Would you rather I badger you with questions, pry into your memories, spy on you, follow you in the street, hugging the walls on which I've written your name?
Or should I shake you awake at night to ask who you're dreaming of?
Besides, that's unnecessary.
Why?
You dream out loud, my love.
Out loud?
Yes, my love.
Only last night. You talked in your sleep.
What did I say?
Nothing much.
Baptiste!"
I said "Baptiste"?
Yes, my love, that's what you said.
anything else?
Nothing.
Just "Baptiste."
That's all?
That's all.
What do you mean?
But isn't it enough to fill my heart with despair?
O perfidious creature. Othello killed Desdemona for much less.
For nothing.
Othello became a widower by his own hand.
For nothing.
For a triﬂe. A little handkerchief.
A batiste handkerchief, no doubt.
Someone insists on seeing you.
Why all the ﬂowers?
Has someone died?
Yes, someone has died.
An overconfident man who thought he'd seen everything.
And you killed him.
You're frightening me.
Have no fear. Because of you, another man is born.
He entrusts his life to you.
To do what?
As you wish.
I am your prisoner. Do with me as you will.
All that I possess... and I possess a great deal... all that is mine, I lay at your feet.
Forgive me.
Never have I been so moved, so overcome.
I express myself poorly.
I realize I speak in platitudes, banalities.
What I say is of no importance.
What matters is your reply.
One word can change your life.
Tomorrow, if you wish, the most feted beauties will bite their lips bloody hearing your name.
Their rarest jewels will pale next to yours.
The finest equipages...
I'm afraid of horses.
Don't say no.
Why say yes if I don't want to?
Then say nothing. Let me hope.
While you do all the talking.
And being overcome, you'll spout more banalities.
Diamonds, horses, the strap, the oats, then the harness.
The easy life.
If it all fell from heaven, I might say yes.
But the way you talk:
One word can change your life."
So my life is a triﬂe.
A bagatelle of a life.
What if I enjoy my little life?
But you just walk in and take over.
You take inventory.
I appeal to you. Fine and dandy.
What if someone loved me?
Out of the question.
You're much too lovely to be truly loved.
Beauty is an exception, an affront to an ugly world.
Men rarely love beauty.
They pursue it to blot it out, forget it.
Are you a hunter?
Don't misunderstand me.
I'm being serious.
I merely offer you shelter.
Shelter?
I've changed.
It's regrettable, but I can't help it.
Ever since I saw you,
I've been dreaming absurd, childish things.
I'm getting old, or else lightning struck.
I no longer exist, I'm shattered.
Listless, made of air, cardboard, like this chicken.
Lightning struck.
And that's thunder. A three-franc fine.
My apologies.
I know how troublesome I've been.
Who sounded the thunder?
I did.
You know the fine: three francs.
You owe me three francs.
But there's no rush.
I have work and enough to live on.
Enough to live on. I hope that's true.
Allow me to take my leave.
Forgive me if I've looked foolish.
Your beauty alone is the cause of my confusion.
I haven't introduced myself. Unforgivable.
Count Edouard de Montray.
Do keep the card.
One never knows. Misfortune strikes at random.
Someday you may need help or protection.
If you do, come what may,
I remain your faithful servant.
You can have complete faith in me.
Flowers. A wreath.
Just as I said, a funeral.
Mine, perhaps.
You're mad. Why Say that?
Why shouldn't Baptiste have his funeral?
Like everybody else.
It's true, I think of it sometimes.
A good idea: Baptiste takes his secret to the grave.
Stop it. It's stupid to talk that way.
His secret.
His little glimmer.
The memory of the night he thought he'd be happy forever.
Spare me that expression.
A funeral's not so sad.
A few rays of sunshine and everyone's happy.
Think of it this way.
It's merrier than a wedding with just a groom and no bride.
I don't like this wedding bouquet.
I hate these ﬂowers.
I hate everyone.
That man who was just here.
I hate Frédérick.
I hate myself.
Baptiste?
Who's this Baptiste?
His beloved doesn't love him, he's a nothing, a will-o'-the-wisp, an automaton, a bogeyman.
No more Baptiste.
Here lies Baptiste.
Life gave him a red ﬂower, a good beating, a pinewood overcoat.
Who says I don't love you?
I say so.
How would you know?
When it comes to Baptiste, I know, see, understand, feel.
I forbid you.
It's true. You have nothing to say.
Of course, I don't mean you're lying.
But I know.
All the love in the world for Baptiste is mine, mine.
There's no room for others.
It's fate. it's written.
I have it all. That's how it is.
Go ahead and smile.
I always do.
You're lucky.
I hardly ever smile now.
Nor do you.
You were so lively, devoted to your work.
Stop it, please.
Leave me, leave us alone.
Get out, do you hear?
Go. It's your fault he's like this.
Forgive me for saying that.
It's not just jealousy but I have so much faith.
I'm absolutely certain
Baptiste and I were made to be together.
Mr. Forestier?
Second ﬂoor, rear.
Places. Our prey is here.
The hamper's in place. Fine.
You give me the creeps.
Remember: He knocks, I let him in, you hit him.
If necessary, I finish him off.
He's in luck. Mr. Forestier's rarely in.
In the two weeks he's been here, I've seen him twice.
What's he like?
A gentleman.
Commended by Miss Garance, oddly.
You don't like her?
I ignore her.
She bamboozled poor Mr. Frédérick.
But I rented the ﬂat.
A well-bred boarder is a nice change.
Murderers!
Murderers! What is it?
Just a drunken brawl.
I'll get the police.
Murderers!
Poor Avril. You were as white as a sheet.
Like the victim.
His face was so close. His eyes.
You should've hit him sooner.
What will you have?
A stiff brandy.
A hot chocolate.
Like a lion, you hear?
Quiet, please.
You say this "Mr. Forestier" knew Miss Garance?
An odd name, no?
I fought like a lion.
They thumped me, but I held my bag like a lion.
My head's solid.
Enough.
A solid head, all right.
You were saying.
I don't know. I'm in such a state.
Mr. Forestier. Such a gentleman.
But when I asked Miss Garance, she said, "Don't know any Forestier."
Thrown from the third ﬂoor.
Horrible. A father of six children.
The third ﬂoor.
I heard he jumped from the third ﬂoor... because of a woman.
What happened?
A man threw his wife out the window. Horrible.
A mother of six.
You can't go in.
I live here.
All right, then.
That's her.
I know her.
I arrested her over a watch.
She went free, but it was suspect.
Better and better.
Anything you say may be used against you.
I'm not talkative.
We'll see about that.
What do you call yourself?
I never call myself.
I'm always here. There's no need.
But others call me Garance.
That's no name.
It's a ﬂower.
My real name, my maiden name, is Claire.
Claire what?
Claire as the day.
Your surname.
My mother was Reine.
Madame Reine.
She didn't have family.
A foundling, as they say.
Your trade?
I'm an artiste.
I'm surprised Madame didn't tell you.
Put down "artiste."
Artiste... in the boudoir.
Why so rude?
We're not rude.
We're just joking.
Where do you perform? And since when?
The Funambules. About three weeks.
Just passing through town.
And before that?
I was a model.
Sure. For who?
Lots of people. Mr. Ingres, for one.
Don't know him.
He's a bit like you.
He fiddles around.
None of your jokes, my girl.
You joke, too.
I imagine I needn't ask the lady what outfit she poses in.
A beauty like that?
Some question.
This is my inquiry.
Your inquiry's done, since I'm safe and sound.
He threw his wife out the window?
He doesn't look mean.
That's enough.
What did I do wrong?
I don't understand.
You'll understand soon enough.
But first tell us who this Mr. Forestier is.
I told the lady I didn't know him.
The nerve.
But you may know him by another name.
Young, dark clothing, manicured hands, very mannered speech, and impeccable white shirts.
Ring a bell?
White shirts?
You know, I used to be a laundress.
A respectable trade, at least.
Yes, and it could even be pleasant if folks were cleaner.
Chief, I saw the fellow with her.
I did. The day you stole the watch.
So you deal in watches, too?
It wasn't me. You let me go.
I was sorry I did.
If it wasn't her, it was him. And they were together.
Why the face? This watch business is nothing.
Just an appetizer before the main course:
attempted murder.
Accessory. That'll get you five or six years, at least.
It's for your own good. We're only trying to help you. We set the table.
Now fork out.
Hands off.
Respect, is it?
Why not? I'm innocent.
That'll do.
Pack her off.
Pack me off. Careful.
Fragile: Work of art.
Use a bit of tact, please.
You don't know who you're dealing with.
Kindly inform this person I've been the victim of a judicial error.
END OF PART ONE
COMING UPI PART TWO
CHILDREN OF PARADISE
The famous mime Baptiste Deburau passionately loves a minor actress, Garance.
Out of timidity, he misses his chance to conquer her.
Instead, she becomes the mistress of the great actor Frederick Lemaitre.
At the Funambules Theatre, a rich dandy, Count de Montray, offers her his protection.
She turns him down.
But when wrongly accused of taking part in a murder attempt by her friend Lacenaire,
Garance holds out the count's card to the astonished police.
PART TWO "THE MAN IN WHITE"
Several years have gone by...
The worst play ever seen on the Boulevard.
The absolute worst.
Why do it then?
Because I signed on.
Why did you sign?
I need money.
You earn a fortune.
I end up with nothing, since I spend more than I earn.
Hurry UP- The authors are impatient.
Alas.
THE INN OF THE ADRETS IN REHEARSAL
If punctuality is the courtesy of kings... it's not that of Frédérick Lemaitre.
And they call them authors.
Why do honest folk persist in writing tales of brigands?
Even convicts could write better than that.
At least they have experience.
A drink, my little kittens.
Thank you, child.
Not at all convincing.
Poor Robert Macaire.
What's going on, my kittens?
I can't hear you.
We're sad.
We both love you, but we're friends, so...
So?
We don't want to quarrel.
Then do as I do.
Act.
It's your chosen profession.
When I act, I'm madly in love.
You hear?
At the final curtain, the audience leaves with my love.
Understand? I make the audience a gift of my love.
The audience is gratified, and so am I.
Then I become sensible, calm and free again, silent as Baptiste.
Not that again.
That's all I hear. "Have you seen Baptiste?"
Even Théophile Gautier:
Don't miss Baptiste in The Ragman. A masterpiece."
Calling a pantomime a "masterpiece."
Théophile's gone too far.
Don't touch. It's a souvenir.
It pricks.
Viper of memory, stab of regret, red light of oblivion."
it's all nonsense, fantasy, hot air.
What I like is reality.
Only two acts, but well made. Compliments to the authors.
What vulgarity, really.
You think it's funny.
Well, I don't, you hear?
That's it. We've quarreled.
Are you angry with me?
Excuse me.
What is it?
Nothing. Just some people waiting for you.
Poor authors.
Not them.
They started rehearsals without us ages ago.
Admirers, no doubt?
That's it... "admirers."
I'm coming.
Back in a moment, my sweet.
Tidy up after you finish snooping around.
Poor costume.
As bad as mine.
The manager wants you.
So, where are our knaves?
You make debts, you pay them.
The cad.
Box his ears.
Jealous husbands, angry creditors.
As usual.
Grumblers and malcontents. A fog of men.
You go first. We'll plunge into the fog once more.
Gentlemen?
Swindler. My money.
My bills.
You ham.
Help. They're striking Robert Macaire.
Call out the cossacks.
They're killing Frederick the Great.
So I run out of the inn when I hear the shot.
You rush over to the body.
Where the body should be, as Mr. Lemaitre isn't here.
Fine.
Shall we?
The hour of justice strikes.
You won't escape punishment.
Alas, you have killed him.
O woe.
He was a wicked man, but he was my husband.
Excuse me. I got carried away.
However, I would like just a bit more...
A touch more...
A touch more feeling.
Yes, that's right. Feeling.
Feeling, feeling, and more feeling.
Dare I hope, gentlemen, my costume is to your taste?
Not bad. It has something.
This must be some kind...
Of a joke.
Robert Macaire and his evil sidekick haven't been to their tailor's, but in a penal colony.
They're bandits, not dandies.
But that eye patch.
It's hideous.
The eye behind it is even more hideous.
Gentlemen, let's not argue again.
He's here, so let's rehearse Act II, scene 9.
On with it.
I'd rather do the scene with the gendarmes. It's funnier.
We are not here to amuse the gallery.
A pity.
Oh, well, if you insist.
Come on, Latour, old girl. Scene 9.
My son.
You give me the courage to face the wretch behind our misfortune.
Egad, my wife.
Yes, your wife and victim.
Woeful Marie.
She does look glum.
Spare us your asides.
On with it.
I am found out.
You betrayed me, Marie.
To save my son.
To save your son, you betray his father.
Alas.
I shall feign to be moved.
Marie.
My poor Marie.
Robert.
My poor Robert.
Could you really have committed all those crimes?
What can I say, Marie?
No one's perfect.
Stop!
That's not in the play.
So?
Your play's empty.- It needs some padding.
Outrageous!
That's right. Your wretched "inn" is empty.
Think the audience will bring their supper?
They'll bring tomatoes.
You call this a drama?
Some drama. And in three acts.
One each. So no one feels cheated.
Three acts. I call them actionable.
Don't play with words.
What can I play with?
Your ideas? You have none.
Come now, Frédérick.
We can't be insulted by someone who got his start in pantomimes...
On his hands.
Why not?
You wrote a play with your feet.
Monsieur!
You force us to take drastic measures.
Monsieur, you signed a contract and have received...
And spent.
...a generous advance.
Are you prepared to honor your obligations?
Are you prepared to perform our play?
Why, certainly, gentlemen.
Provided it plays along.
Enough. We have a description of the culprit.
Don't try to escape. You're surrounded.
One of them calls himself Rémond, but we know his real name.
It's Robert Macaire.
And Robert Macaire...
Is you.
Prove you're not him, if you can.
He's in a bind. it's not in the play.
By the time he thinks of a line,
I'll have escaped again.
Come on, Rover, let's be off.
The drama isn't played out yet.
Frédérick, please, come back.
Stop them. They'll get away.
Don't move, you're surrounded.
Just when I get a chance to see the play.
Enough speeches. Surrender.
To whom?
You clever boy.
Come now.
You've been unmasked.
We know you're Robert Macaire.
If you're not Macaire, the escaped convict, answer me this:
Who are you?
I am Frédérick Lemaitre.
Liar.
You're under arrest. Not again.
Shall We kill him?
Killing gendarmes never hurt anybody.
Fall down, you fool.
You're dead.
Alas, you've killed him.
O woe.
He was a wicked man, but he was my husband.
Don't worry, dear widow, it was a false alarm.
Dry your tears. Your little hubby lives.
Not for long.
It had to end like this.
I die.
Farewell, Marie.
Forgive me.
I wasn't a bad man.
It was the company I kept.
I was but the arm that executes, the hand that strikes, the foot that leaves its mark in the dust of crime.
But the true criminals, those who plotted in the shadows...
I point out to Divine Justice.
The true authors of this crime are there.
A triumph.
A disgrace without precedent.
So, gentlemen, I trust you're satisfied.
Monsieur, you've insulted us.
Only your ignorance prevents you from seeing that by insulting us, you have deeply insulted the Dramatic Arts.
You have sacked and trampled our oeuvre, debased our prose.
It's good luck.
Vulgarian.
We demand satisfaction.
As you like. Tomorrow morning?
Not a duel.
The Holy Trinity feels offended, so we have to cross swords.
Arrange it.
Let them draw straws. I'll fight the winner.
You may have the choice of arms.
I'll be at the chestnut grove at dawn... with my seconds.
A wise precaution.
What are you doing here?
How did you get in?
Hands off. it's a souvenir.
It might be one for me, as well. Who knows?
And who are you?
My name will mean nothing. As you're famous enough for two, let's forego introductions and get to the purpose of my call.
I'll be brief. I need money.
Everyone does.
More or less.
Maybe, but I'd like to know why you come to me.
I don't even know you.
No matter.
I know you.
All Paris knows you.
You're too kind.
But let's not get carried away.
Yes, you are already famous, and no doubt rich enough for a man at bay to appeal to you, quite simply.
At bay?
It's a matter of life and death.
Seriously?
Do I look like I'm joking?
I'm not rich, but perhaps Fate sent you.
I won at the lottery last week.
I haven't spent it all. You're in luck.
I'd give it all to a friend or brother.
But as I haven't the honor of knowing you... all I can say is:
Let's share it.
If this little amount can help, it's all yours.
Quite simply."
You amaze me. Actors are said to be misers.
Great ones, especially.
Fine, then.
There's still progress to be made.
You practice a peculiar craft.
The finest.
No doubt. But you make hearts beat every night at the same hour.
You don't understand.
That's the beauty of it.
It's dazzling.
To feel and hear your heart and the heart of the audience beat at the same time.
How promiscuous.
If my heart starts to beat loudly,
I take special delight in being the only one to hear it.
May I ask what the owner of such a heart does in life?
If I told you, you wouldn't believe me.
I write plays in my spare time.
You're an author.
An neglected author, no doubt.
Yes, neglected. But I have no regrets.
I write light pieces, but nowadays people prefer tragedies.
I'm fond of one of my plays, though.
A short piece full of joy and sorrow.
Two lovers are parted, reunited, then parted again.
The setting, all in soft green: a garden, a fountain.
Interesting.
But tell me... now that we're acquainted... was this money business really a matter of life and death?
Yes. For you.
For me?
Had you been so foolhardy as to refuse...
I can assure you the blade doesn't retract into the handle.
You don't think Frédérick would resist?
I didn't come here alone.
Incredible. Like a scene from the play.
Happy now?
I sure am.
This imbecile is a great admirer of yours.
The thought of...
I felt sick.
No, really?
How nice.
So there are decent folks in every trade.
So, did you enjoy the play?
Don't ask. The boy is shy about his feelings.
But you were there tonight?
Well?
Interesting.
I wouldn't criticize...
Please do.
It's not every day you come across a specialist.
A connoisseur.
This is marvelous.
Do me the honor of supping with me.
I had it prepared for the authors. But I doubt...
But I doubt...
It's most kind of you, but we don't wish to intrude.
And you must be tired.
Not at all.
Just famished. No formalities. Let's eat.
If you insist.
I have to regain my strength. I have a duel at dawn.
It must be unpleasant to die on an empty stomach.
A duel?
With whom?
With some fool.
You'll kill him, I hope?
If we had to kill every fool...
Indeed.
Yet it would make life so much easier.
And with success at our doorstep.
You're killing the goose that lays the golden egg.
The goose might...
Kill us.
Gentlemen, please.
I'm the only one dueling.
Because you're the only one who can use a pistol.
A pistol.
Here he comes.
And for once, he's on time.
He's drunk.
Gentlemen, my apologies.
No time to change into black.
We talked all night. The time ﬂew by.
True, we're not here to exchange pleasantries, but lead.
Let me introduce my seconds, who, for political reasons, shall remain nameless.
You can't be serious. You're not your usual self.
My usual self? What's that?
You can't even walk straight.
No matter.
I'm not going far.
Besides, in such ceremonies, the line of sight is the shortest distance between two points.
NO PERFORMANCE
it's sold out, I tell you.
And tomorrow?
Not a seat left.
Unheard of. A ticket seller without tickets.
Oh, Mr. Frédérick.
You're hurt?
From a pigeon shoot. A peck in the arm.
I bet the pigeon's worse off. Is that why you're closed?
I heard your play was a hit last night.
The talk of the Boulevard.
It's like with Baptiste.
Things were slow, and then all of a sudden... it's incredible.
The whole town's fighting for seats.
But you'll find me one.
That won't be easy.
I've got an idea.
A young society woman comes every night, all alone, incognito, to see Baptiste.
Lucky Baptiste. Is she pretty?
I don't know.
She wears a veil and leaves without saying a word.
Excuse me, Madame, just this once.
A seat for an injured gentlemen.
It's all right.
Garance!
Frédérick!
What brings you here, sir?
Paris is so small for such great lovers as we."
Why the sir; Garance?
Don't be angry.
I'm like that with everyone now.
O Desdemona. Perfidious creature.
To walk off like that, saying,
See you later," and then vanish for years.
And when she decides to return, she asks innocently,
What brings you here, sir?"
I never left. I knew you'd be back.
I waited in this chair. For years.
You haven't changed.
Neither have you, Madame.
But, in fact, you have.
You have changed.
You're more desirable than ever.
And I don't know... you're.
More distinguished?
You're hurt?
It's nothing. it's already healed.
There are other wounds that take longer to heal.
Wounded pride, perhaps, but a wound all the same.
So it was that man,
Desdemona, that man with the ﬂowers you left with?
Where did you go?
Where did he take you?
That nabob.
I did go to India.
But not for long.
I lived in England most of the time.
And Scotland.
Is Scotland beautiful?
Yes...
But it's so far away.
I love only Paris.
Paris and its memories.
Baptiste, for example.
Baptiste, whom you watch every night.
As if you didn't know that Frédérick Lemaitre also performs nightly.
Listen to the Gods.
I used to laugh like that once.
I'd burst out laughing, just like that, without thinking.
But nowadays...
You're sad.
No, but I'm not cheerful either.
A spring broke in the music box.
The tune is the same but it's in a different key.
He's marvelous.
He's gentleness itself. How does he manage to look so cruel?
So you love him?
Since I left, not a day goes by that I don't think of him.
He knows you come every night to see him?
No. He has his life, I have mine.
What would be the point?
This can't be happening to me.
This is absurd.
What is it?
I think I'm jealous.
I don't know.
I've never felt anything like this.
It's insidious, unpleasant.
It infects your heart.
You try to reason, but your reason fails you.
Do you realize, Garance?
Just now, because of you, because of Baptiste,
I felt jealous.
Me, jealous.
And full of regrets.
That man, that traveler taking you away, and me letting you go.
And to make things worse, there's Baptiste performing like a god.
It's not that I want him to be awful, but maybe just...
Yes, just a bit bad.
Not bad.
But mediocre... I'd have liked that.
At least, when I talk about it, it stops.
You see? It wasn't so serious.
A slight attack. You're already recovered.
Recovered?
Why should I recover so fast?
What if I enjoyed it?
What if jealousy was helpful to me?
Useful, even necessary.
Thank you, Garance.
Thanks to all of you,
I can at last play Othello.
I didn't feel the character. He was alien to me.
Now he's a friend, a brother.
Othello, my heart's desire.
After you, Desdemona.
I'll go embrace Baptiste. I owe him that much.
Shall I take a message?
Really, Frédérick.
I mean it.
True, I may be jealous, but I understand.
And he has a wife and child. That makes me feel better.
Whereas that other man...
Well, Garance?
You might mention me.
And if he seems to care, say I'm passing through Paris, that I'm leaving soon, and that I'd be happy, so very happy, if he came to say hello.
So it's you, ingrate.
After all these years.
But the prodigal son returns.
Don't forget Alexis's fine for being drunk, brawling, and breaking a vase.
Five francs.
The fine's gone up? Noblesse oblige.
The price of success.
You're not doing so badly yourself.
I'm glad. Bravo.
You've come.
And I took the first step. On one hand.
Hardly. I've been to see you several times.
And no hello?
I didn't dare. Besides, I was so moved.
You're a great actor now. The greatest.
Really, no.
What you do is sublime.
No, it's you, There are many great actors.
A few, anyway.
But great mimes...
before you there was no one. You're unique. You invented it all.
I'm glad you like my work.
It's Nathalie.
You're a real beauty now.
I'm not beautiful, Frédérick.
Just happy-
Beauty and happiness go together.
This little fellow's yours?
What's your name?
Baptiste.
Like his father.
Quite a family, is it not?
Greetings, Frédérick.
It's truly a great day when the greatest actor in Europe and beyond at last calls on the world's undisputed masters of pantomime.
And there we are.
Greetings, all.
This is Jericho, alias Wild Boar,
Lone Sleeper.
I can't stand his repulsive looks and distasteful voice.
Here you are, bandit, body snatcher.
Don't start.
Shame on you. You stole my looks, my identity.
You're not the only ragman in Paris.
Besides, you supplied the costume.
I didn't realize what it was for.
Every night, Baptiste kills a poor old man like me... as entertainment.
What an example. Enough, friend.
You're drunk and babbling.
Go home to bed.
I may be drunk, but I've still got principles.
Why don't you ever say hello to Ol' Papa Joshua?
You're just like your father.
You despise and shun me.
What's Baptiste got against me?
Nothing.
Only that you don't mind your own business.
Is it his business what is or isn't mine?
I've always lived all alone. So I take an interest in others.
Always alone. That's no life.
No one to love me. Nothing, zero, naught.
If I were a widower, at least I'd have memories.
But no woman would have me.
They preferred little ﬂy-by-nights and libertines.
Listen, Nathalie.
Let me tell you something.
Sure, it's none of my business, but it's for your own good.
Spare me your gossip.
Just listen. This won't take long.
Garance is back.
She's here, in Box 7, and she's waiting for Baptiste.
Garance!
Like the ﬂower.
Box 7.
Don't forget.
Mama.
Listen.
It's true, you know.
I often miss the Funambules.
Do you also have good memories of our work together?
Yes, good memories.
You're not angry with me?
Why should I be angry?
Garance.
Let bygones be bygones.
It's all behind us now.
Come in.
Hello, Madame.
I have a message for you.
I came to say we're happy together, Mama, Papa and me.
Did your father send you?
No, Mama did.
But Mama, Papa or me... it's the same.
Mama was right.
About what?
You're beautiful.
When I grow up, I'll get married to someone like you.
Or like Mama, if I can.
You're a darling boy.
Are you married?
You don't have a little boy?
I don't have a little boy.
Then you're all alone?
Yes.
I'm all alone.
Weren't you curious about this woman who comes to see you every night?
Perhaps you're used to it.
You're on, Baptiste.
Listen, Baptiste.
I should have told you sooner.
That woman is Garance.
She's back, but not for long.
She'd like to see you, you understand?
What's wrong?
Good evening, my angel.
Pierre-François.
Who?
Ah, yes, Pierre-François.
Forgive me. I lose track of all the names I use.
A childish precaution. The police are so inept.
Unlike me. I am well informed.
For example, I knew about your return at once.
I learned where you were living, and with whom.
Nothing escapes you.
And I know they've put my angel in a gilded cage.
I'm not throwing stones.
I've been in prison myself lately, and in the provinces.
Not even a hint of a smile? I used to amuse you.
Have you lost your gaiety, or is it so unpleasant to see me?
On the contrary,
I'm glad to see you. Yes, it reminds me of...
An entire era.
Yes, the easy years, the happy days, the good life.
Never look back at the past, my angel.
It leaps at your throat like a mad dog.
I was lucky enough to be happy.
Despite all.
Back then.
Don't be silly.
Then as now.
Time has nothing to do with happiness.
Really?
And the man in white?
Do you think your friend, the mime, is happy?
To think I had the absurd notion of killing him.
Comical, no?
One might as well stab at a breeze or a moonbeam.
And the other one: Frédérick.
I considered him too.
I even called on him on an amusing pretext.
Which was?
To ask this complete stranger for money. He'd refuse and...
And he gave it to you?
A large sum. Amazing.
Unselfish people still exist.
People.
Actors aren't people. They're every man and no man.
People of high society: Those are people.
Like Count de Montray, one of France's richest notables.
You've changed.
Have I?
You used to speak of yourself, rarely of others.
But what's become of you?
I've become famous.
A few sensational crimes.
The name Lacenaire has been in the crime columns.
Hunted by police in the provinces, while he is here in Paris with his guardian angel.
You're a celebrity.
I'm becoming one.
But upon reﬂection, I'd have preferred literary success.
Never satisfied.
They say the count is a generous patron of the arts.
I'd enjoy meeting him.
Do you really need to?
Don't worry.
I'd like to meet the man who laid the icy hand of wealth on the pale shoulder of my angel.
There were no strings attached.
I'm still free.
Perhaps. That's what bothers me.
It's so painful to see you again, and find you unchanged.
I'd prefer to find you ravaged, submissive, rendered stupid by wealth.
Then I could have lived with an easy conscience, and my fine idea of mankind.
My poor Pierre-François.
You think I'm a monster, don't you?
Possibly, but you're not the only one.
Alas.
Edouard de Montray, I presume?
Himself.
I was so anxious to meet you.
And now I have. I'm delighted.
How amusing.
Amusing and unexpected. And to whom...
No one. it's of no importance.
You do realize that I find your manner most distasteful.
Who are you, Monsieur?
Is it not absurd to ask people who they are?
Excuse me?
That's why they're so evasive.
They give you the easy reply: a name, a title.
But who they are really, who they are deep down, they conceal with great care.
You speak for yourself.
No, everyone. You as well.
I find your ways quite indiscreet.
You don't know me, yet you ask who I am.
The nerve.
Enough. Where can my seconds...
Pointless. I'm not a man who duels. Absolutely not.
That explains things in part.
Or if I do, the choice of arms is always mine.
I choose one, just one, and I keep one for me, on me, and I kill when I'm sure, when it pleases me.
Of course, it's more expeditious.
To each his own method.
Quite.
I presume you have nothing more to say.
Valentin.
I warn you I am not a man one throws out.
I would regret having to kill a servant.
Have no fear. Valentin is an old retainer to whom I'm very attached.
Will you show the gentleman out?
Good evening.
Good evening, my friend.
How strange.
When I'm not home you sing, but when I come in, you fall silent.
You only like serious music.
Sadly, our tastes differ.
May I ask where you spent the evening?
At the Funambules.
Again.
And you, at those ghastly animal fights.
Ghastly" is too strong a word.
They threw a mangy bear to three mastiffs like a bone. It wasn't sport, but butchery.
A most dreary evening.
And the Funambules?
I won't be going back again.
I'm delighted.
Don't belittle the Funambules.
You forget we met there.
Which no doubt explains your pious nightly pilgrimage?
No, my friend.
The contrary would surprise me.
May I know the name of that man who just left?
Were you at the Funambules with him?
That man?
I see.
An old acquaintance. He came to say hello.
A most peculiar individual. What does he do?
He writes.
To be perfectly honest, when I knew him, he was also a thief, and something of a murderer.
I hope there was nothing between you and this individual.
I trust you entirely.
No merit in that.
I've never had a chance to lie to you.
True enough.
Oblige me by seeing such people as seldom as possible.
Actors, perhaps, but thieves, murderers... isn't that rather shocking?
Remember the young Scot you challenged to a duel in Edinburgh?
I remember quite well.
He wasn't nearly as good a shot as you.
Of course. Everyone knew it.
But you killed him anyway.
Feelings, Garance, in an affair of honor...
All because I smiled at him.
Yes. In public, and frequently.
But I told you I was thinking of another.
Please understand how much I want your love.
For yourself.
Don't torment me.
You know what I'd do for you, because of you.
Because of me.
I love you as no man...
Could ever love me.
So why complain?
I want you to love me.
I do love you, my friend.
You're charming, rich, witty.
Friends admire you, others fear you.
You appeal to women.
Everyone loves you.
How could I not do the same?
Stop it.
You know what I desire, what I want.
You're incredible.
Not only are you rich, but you want to be loved as if you were poor.
But what about the poor?
Be reasonable. Don't deprive them of everything.
Understand me...
I do.
And I'll continue to do my best to please you.
But don't ask the impossible.
However, if you like, if it makes you happy, tomorrow all Paris will know I'm mad about you.
Yes, mad.
I'll shout it from the rooftops.
But to you, privately, my friend, I say this:
I loved a man, and I still love him.
I came back to Paris to see him.
He let me know he'd forgotten me.
All I can think of now is to leave once again, to get away.
Come in.
Your dinner, Mr. Baptiste.
Thank you, but I'm not hungry.
You're being unreasonable.
True, I'm unreasonable.
Shutting yourself up like a monk.
Monks pray.
I sleep, I dream.
Everyone's looking for you.
Hardly everyone.
The Funambules is closed.
Your wife, your son, your father, the whole troupe... you can't just forget them like that.
But I couldn't go on living like an idiot in an asylum, with everyone around me whispering,
What's wrong?
Is he ill?"
I even saw a doctor to make them happy.
What did he say?
That I was fit as a fiddle.
Mild depression, overwork.
It's nothing." And his prescription?
Go see Baptiste. That will cheer you up."
What if I don't want to cheer up?
What's today?
Thursday.
Tonight's the premiere of Othello, with Mr. Frederick.
You should go. It will cheer you up.
Oh, sorry.
Othello would make a nice pantomime.
A man kills his beloved and it kills him, poor man.
A sad, absurd tale, like so many others.
Like mine or yours, Madame Hermine.
You spend your empty days in your empty rooms with your poor empty heart.
It's all so absurd and sad.
Like me.
Years ago, I stood here by this bed, in this very room.
And she stood there, smiling, happy, so lovely in the fresh night air.
And she said,
Love is so simple."
And I didn't listen.
I didn't take her in my arms.
I set conditions: "Love me as I love you."
And I shut the door, forever, between my love and me.
What are you doing here?
I'm talking to myself. Not to you.
Forgive me. I didn't mean to be unpleasant.
You've helped me and been so discreet.
It's only natural.
I can't...
I can't stay here any longer.
All alone.
I have to get out. I have to walk.
Did he eat?
He Will.
Good.
Thank you for telling me. I was so anxious.
It's only natural, between women.
He needs to be alone.
We mustn't disturb him.
He's not like other men.
Of course not.
He's like a sleepwalker on a roof.
If you call him, he falls.
We mustn't call him.
We have to leave him, wait until he's calm and wakes on his own.
When he wakes, he'll come back.
Get me some poison, Iago, this night.
I'll not expostulate with her lest her body and beauty unprovide my mind again.
Do it not with poison.
Strangle her in her bed, even the bed she hath contaminated.
Let her rot and perish and be damned tonight,
for she shall not live.
Such savagery and lack of decorum.
I can't say I like this Mr. Shakespeare.
True, one goes to the theatre today not for the play, but for the actors.
Don't forget, my friend, you insisted on coming.
No doubt I had my reasons.
Hang her.
I do but say what she is.
The pity of it, Iago.
The pity of it.
May I?
Of course.
Desdemona came tonight.
Othello is no longer jealous He is cured.
You see?
I assure you, you're wrong.
Naturally, I'm wrong and you're innocent.
Othello, too.
Please tell me the truth. Is it him?
No, my friend, it's not him.
That handkerchief which I so loved and gave thee thou gavest to Cassio.
No, by my life and soul.
Send for the man and ask him.
Sweet soul, take heed.
Take heed of perjury:
Thou art on thy deathbed.
Dying: easily said, and just as easily done.
WW do you laugh?
Because if we duel in the morning he won't be here to talk of death in the evening.
You're mad.
Why should you care, if it's not him you love?
Kill me tomorrow: Let me live tonight.
Nay, if you strive...
But half an hour.
Being done, there is no pause.
But while I say one prayer.
It is too late.
The play's not over.
We're just going to the foyer.
I really must congratulate this remarkable actor.
If you do, I'll never see you again.
Nor him either, for that matter.
Come.
Where?
I don't know.
Monsieur, you play the bloodthirsty brute so naturally.
You're too kind.
I merely played him as Shakespeare wrote him, as naturally as possible.
A peculiar fellow, this Mr. Shakespeare.
I hear he made his literary debut as a butcher's apprentice.
Why not?
Which would explain the bestial nature of his plays, and his popularity among dockers and carters.
And kings.
I see why I found this play so distasteful and shocking.
I'll buy my coachman a seat.
It's worth trying.
Then allow me to offer you a box for your horses.
It's worth trying."
I thought you'd forgotten me.
I thought I'd lost you forever.
I've never forgotten you.
You were even in my dreams.
You saved me from growing old, dull and used up.
My life was so empty. I felt so alone.
I kept thinking I had no right to be sad because someone loved me.
But I still love you.
I always have.
And do you love...
Don't answer.
I won't ask for anything.
You're here. That's all that matters.
Here, alive in my arms, like the first time.
I ask for nothing.
Only... the warmth of your body against mine,
that mouth of yours.
Those eyes of yours.
My compliments.
You were superb.
May I introduce...
No need.
We met once before. One time too often.
Amusing.
These gentlemen seek a quarrel with me, all very politely, I admit.
We all must kill time in some way.
Gentlemen, you're wrong about my friend here.
I haven't known him long, but in his way, he's a remarkable fellow, and not lacking in talent.
All kinds of talents, no doubt.
It takes all kinds to make a world, or unmake it.
Amusing.
An amusing pleasantry.
Quite.
You really find him amusing?
Then let us amuse ourselves.
Besides, we run no risk.
The gentleman doesn't duel.
Absolutely not.
How do you exercise your talents these days?
Since you ask,
I'm putting the finishing touches to something that will cause a sensation.
A tragedy, no doubt.
A comedy, a farce.
Or a tragedy, if you prefer.
It's all the same. There's no difference.
Or so little.
For example, if a king is deceived, it's a tragedy of infidelity.
He's deceived not by his wife...
But by Fate.
Yes, Fate.
But if it's a poor devil like you or me, Monsieur de Montray... and I use "me" as a figure of speech... it's no longer a tragedy, but mere buffoonery, a sorry tale of cuckolds.
Yet it's the same wood under the pauper's cap or the king's crown.
The dead wood of love rotting in the heads of the unloved.
Always the same matter, the same stories, the same tears.
So the genre is nothing. My play need only amuse.
Starting with the author.
If it's performed.
Don't worry, gentlemen. It will be.
It's in progress as we speak. If you'd like a role...
Very funny.
It is very funny.
But, I warn you, there are murders, and at the final curtain, the dead won't rise for a bow.
This man is a bore.
Shall we throw him out?
Good idea.
Don't try to humiliate me.
I'm not some character out of a farce.
But you are.
And I'll prove it.
What have you done?
It doesn't concern you.
Gentlemen, I've just savored a most exquisite moment.
Too bad for you.
I said I wasn't a man to be thrown out with impunity.
Again, this doesn't concern you.
How do you know?
Jealousy belongs to all if a woman belongs to none.
They're going to duel.
Because of us?
Because of me.
But not before tomorrow.
We have the night before us, with us, for us.
If I'm not at home, I'll be at the baths, where I'll be expecting...
My seconds.
You do me a great honor sending to the next world a man who is not part of yours.
You see here a man who's been ousted, unceremoniously.
But the mere thought of them killing one another over a woman, because of me, comforts me.
So we'll be seconds again?
I doubt we'll be asked this time.
Too bad. I like duels.
That can be arranged.
If not a duel, you may be witness to something else.
Because in this affair of honor
I, Lacenaire, am the offended party.
Offended, insulted, even humiliated, because they threw me out, ignominiously.
How lovely the moonlight is.
Look.
It's shining for us, like that first night.
And like that first night, the window is wide open.
It's wonderful.
Everything is the same. Nothing has changed.
The table in the same place.
The bed I slept in.
You haven't changed either.
The same gentleness in your voice.
The same light in your eyes.
A little glimmer.
Your heart beating against my hand.
You were right.
Love is so simple.
Carnival time. Life is beautiful.
A bath, gentlemen?
We merely wish to see Count de Montray.
At this hour? He's resting.
He's expecting us.
In that case, please follow me.
What is it?
Two gentlemen.
They say you're expecting them.
Two gentlemen.
Show them in.
My poor Avril.
The play is over.
You can go now.
You'd be wise to go to the country for a while.
What about you?
Me. I'm staying here.
I won't risk losing my head to a country executioner.
Absolutely not.
It was a wonderful night.
But I must go.
I can't let Frédérick die because of me.
What will you do?
Find Edouard.
Tell him I lost my head.
I'll beg him not to duel.
Will he listen?
Yes.
If I say I love him, and him alone.
You're incapable of lying. He won't believe you.
He doesn't care if it's not true.
I know him.
All he really wants is to hear me say it.
What matters is not that I love him, but that I love no one else.
That's love to him.
What if he asks you to leave with him?
I'll go.
Perhaps I'll come back.
I'd have to leave someday.
Why?
You know why.
You have a sweet little boy.
Stop it.
You love your little boy, and you love your work.
And Nathalie.
It's you I love.
Wait here and be good.
Will you be long?
No, I'll come back for you.
What for?
It's a surprise.
Don't leave me. I can't bear it.
What about me?
I have only you.
Excuse me.
I came by...
I thought you'd be alone.
All alone.
You see, it's carnival today.
Our son was so happy.
So I came by...
He's dressed as a hussar.
A lovely hussar uniform.
Please don't let me stand here like this.
It's awful.
Talk to me at least.
Answer me. Say something.
Anything.
Tell me to go away, laugh in my face.
Is that all you can say?
I really must go.
Again.
How easy it must be.
How easy what must be?
Easy to go, then come back.
You go. You're missed.
Time works for you.
Then you come back, embellished by memory.
That must be easy.
But to stay and live with someone, share his everyday life... that's something else.
You can't fight that.
I've lived with him for six years.
So have I.
You, too?
Me, too.
Anywhere, everywhere, every day.
And every night.
All those nights spent at another's side, I was with him.
Let her finish.
I want to know everything about you two, know what's left for me.
If there's enough to live on.
What do I care if you love him?
You don't count. You don't exist for me.
Listen to me. Answer me.
I'm not afraid to suffer. Everybody suffers.
But I must know. Tell me now.
Without thinking about it.
Look at me.
Were you always thinking of her while living with me?
You don't dare answer.
But your silence tells me a lot of things, things I do understand.
Answer me.
Were you always thinking of her?
Answer me. Even at night?
What about me?
What about me?
The game's up. Time to go home.
Let me go.
For shame.
As sure as I'm called Old Maid,
Wise Counsel, Prim and Proper, for my sense of morality.
Let go. You make me sick.
Out of my way.
When Joan was only one year old, she knew where she was going.
Going right?
When she was five, she was writing, "Dear Father Christmas, I don't want a doll,
and I don't want a big red ball. "What I want is a pair of silk stockings.
She was 12 before she got her first pair of silk stockings, and they were artificial.
All the other girls are waiting to catch the bus. And waiting. Look at her.
Here she comes, straight for the milk van.
At 18, she's a working girl, and she still knows what she wants.
A boy wants to take her to the movies... twice a week, if she'll let him. She would rather have a dinner at the best hotel in town, even if he can only take her once a month.
There she is, that tall, skinny girl.
She's 25 now, and in one thing she's never changed.
She still knows where she's going.
Good evening, Miss Webster.
Good evening, Leon.
I got your telegram.
I thought you were spending your holiday at home.
Oh, I'm sorry, but you see me every weekend. - Did you bring my money? - Yes.
Here you are. Forty seven pounds, ten and nine.
Would you sign the receipt and count the money?
You don't mind my taking it all out, do you? - It's your own money.
As your bank manager, I'd prefer you to leave the account open.
As your father, I... Nothing for me, thank you.
Oh, but you must have something tonight.
He'll have a sherry.
And the usual for you, Miss Webster?
Bring him a gin and Dubonnet.
You have no consideration at all for my position. Oh, darling, be reasonable. Just think of all these girls here.
They've all got fathers who have positions.
Not everybody's father is a bank manager.
Thank you, miss.
Darling... please stop being a bank manager for once.
Just be my father for tonight.
Now look here, Joan, I've come all the way here from Eccleshall, and you know I don't like being seen in expensive places.
You know what my clients will say...
Daddy, I'm going to be married.
What?
Your table, Miss Webster.
Let's go in, darling.
Diamond, huh?
Who is he?
Excuse me. That's a works pass of the CCI.
You can't marry Consolidated Chemical Industries.
No other name on this except your own and...
You can't mean...
Just what I do mean. Robert Bellinger's one of the wealthiest men in England.
Anything wrong with the soup, Miss Webster?
Oh, we were talking. It's cold now.
Excuse me. - Now here, Joan, stop acting.
You're not Lady Bellinger yet.
Anyway, you'll come with me to the station.
I'm picking up the Scotch Express there.
Going to Glasgow? - Further. The Western Isles.
Have you got your ticket? - It's all arranged. Everything's arranged.
I'm going to an Island called Kiloran.
Where is it?
In the Hebrides. It takes a day and a night to get there. It's his island.
We're going to be married there, away from people.
Have you ever been there?
Often. - What? - In my dreams.
He's told me all about it.
There's an old house, and the war's a million miles away.
There are famous sands and sheep and birds and Atlantic seals.
Bellinger must be nearly as old as I am.
And what's wrong with you, darling?
Come on, Daddy, let's dance.
No, no, Joan. Oh, come on, Daddy. You can dance.
Good evening, Hunter. - Good evening. Follow me.
I hope you will be comfortable, miss.
Thanks, Mr. Hunter.
I managed to prevent them from putting you over the wheel.
It's lovely, Hunter.
See you in the morning, Miss Webster.
Yes, please. We get in at 6:30.
I'll call you half an hour before, all right?
Yes, thank you. - Very good, Miss Webster.
Thanks, Mr. Hunter.
It was very clever of you to get a sleeper, Hunter.
Sir Robert's orders.
Not so easy these days, all the same.
We have our methods, sir.
This is my father.
How do you do, sir? Here is an itinerary that I had prepared at Sir Robert's desire.
Would you study it? When you arrive at Glasgow, you change to Buchanan St. Station.
Mr. MacAllister, director of the Bellinger Metal Works, will meet you on your arrival at the central.
You arrive at Oban at 11:30. - Just leaving, sir.
Oh, I must be off. Excuse me.
Good-bye.
Good-bye, Hunter.
Good-bye, Daddy, darling. Send me a wire. I'll be back in a week.
Hunter will give you the address.
Good-bye, darling.
God bless you. - Good-bye, Hunter. - Good-bye, miss.
My very best wishes.
Don't forget to write. Darling, don't worry about me. I know where I'm going!
# I know where I'm going # # And I know who's going with me #
# I know who I love # # But the day knows who I'll marry #
Itinerary of Miss Webster's journey... from Manchester to Isle of Kiloran, Scotland.
Manchester... departure at 1:10 a.m. From Platform I.
# Some say he's black #
# But I say he's bonny # - 12:27 a.m.
# The fairest of them all # # My handsome, winsomeJohnny #
Go to ship Lochinvar, 1:15 p.m. Sail for the western...
# I know where I'm going # # And I know who's going with me #
# I know who I love # # But the day knows who I'll marry #
You can't marry Consolidated Chemical Industries.
Can't I?
Do you, Joan Webster, take Consolidated Chemical Industries... to be your lawful wedded husband?
I do.
And do you, Consolidated Chemical Industries, take Joan Webster to be your lawful wedded wife?
Good evening, Lady Bellinger.
Everything's arranged. Everything's arranged.
Charged to your account tomorrow, of course.
We'll send it, madam. We'll send it, madam.
Five hundred guineas.
Five hundred guineas.
Thank you, madam. Lady Bellinger's car!
# You take the high road and I'll take the low road # # And I'll be in Scotland before thee #
Next station, Gretna Green. You're over the border now.
Glasgow Central! - Oh!
Yes? There's a gentleman to meet you. The station master's with him.
Miss Webster? - Yes.
I'm MacAllister.
How do you do?
This is Mr. Finney.
How do you do?
It's a grand day.
It is.
You'll need all your time to get to Buchanan Street.
Miss Webster? I'm David MacBraynes's agent.
It's a fine day.
Miss Webster.
How do you do, Captain?
Yes, yes. I had a letter about you from Mr. Lee. It is your first visit?
'Tis a sublime day.
Miss Webster? - Yes?
Be getting in quickly, Uncle Bridie.
It's a pity about the day. An hour ago, it was very pretty.
Ah, but it never stays fine for long in the isles. You'll soon get used to it. Are you for Kiloran, Miss Webster?
Yes.
Is it far to Port Erraig? - Quite a step if you walk.
Only 40 minutes if you have a car, and you have a car.
Port Erraig is down yonder behind the trees.
That is Moy Castle, the ancient home of the MacLaines of Erraig. - Where do they live now?
Down there in Erraig House.
Ah, but they'll all be dead now or in New Zealand.
There will only be Catriona MacLaine.
Is anyone allowed in the castle?
Oh, yes, anyone can go in, except the lairds of Kiloran. There's a curse on them. - What sort of curse?
If they should ever set foot across the threshold, man, they say it's a terrible strong curse.
Will I take them for you?
Oh, no, I can manage.
I'd better wait a wee while.
Ruairidh Mhor may not be willing to cross over to Kiloran in this weather.
Oh, no, my fiance is coming over to fetch me.
Oh, so the rich gentleman in spectacles is your fiance?
Yes.
Well, well, a thousand blessings on you both." - Thank you.
But in a fog like the one that's coming up, your fiance won't see any better with six pairs of spectacles than with one.
Good-bye.
Oh, bad luck.
No crossing today.
But isn't that the boat from Kiloran?
No.
And if she was, it is not today she'd be getting back, milady.
That's the ferry boat.
Pity you didn't keep lain's car. That's why I was shouting. But we didn't understand.
Why should I keep it, anyway? To go back to Tobermory and spend the night in a comfortable bed.
But I intend to spend the night on Kiloran.
But it's been arranged for the boat to meet me here, and I'd better be here to meet it. I know the people. Thank you.
Good.
It's the big house up the bray.
Yes, milady.
What would it be but the Gaelic? - - What's that noise?
That would be the seals' signal, miss.
The seals? Yes, yes.
They like the warm, foggy weather.
If my boat doesn't come, will you take me?
No, I will not, milady.
Port Erraig, 5:15 p.m. The boat from Kiloran will meet Miss Webster...
I'm looking for the house. You'll see a wee gate up the bray.
Thank you.
May I be the first to welcome you to these halls, young lady?
You've met the colonel, I see. - I've had that pleasure. My name's Barnstaple.
Colonel Barnstaple. - The greatest hawk trainer...
Falconer, my dear Torquil.
The greatest falconer in the Western Isles.
In the world, old boy. Catriona's out.
She's our hostess.
She's no idea you and I are here, but she'll find a corner for us.
She's a grand girl, bless her heart.
I've known here since we were kids.
She married an Englishman called Potts. He's in the Middle East, and the kids at boarding school.
How's business, Colonel? - Fair. I've got a new line now.
Eagles.
I've been training a golden eagle for seven months. An eagle!
Hunting with it, like a hawk?
That's shaken you.
Where is it? I'd like to see it. Sorry, old boy.
I lost him four days ago, and I haven't got him back yet.
Where did you see him last? - On Golly's leap. I was trying with rabbits.
And the blighter lost interest, sailed off and disappeared in a cloud.
Every day I'm out after him. I've trodden that mountain almost into the ground.
But I'll get him back.
Torquil!
Brown stuff, this Gaelic.
Still got those half-starved hounds?
How do you feed 'em? Oh, we live off the country.
Rabbits, dear, a stray hiker or two.
What do you expect me to do? Eat them myself just when the strain's getting known?
How's that for bone?
Look at that head, eh?
Torquil, it's good of you to come and see an old bag like me.
Good evening. - This is a fellow traveler to Kiloran. Oh, I see.
Ruairidh wouldn't take you over.
You're right, but I love you just the same.
I came over on the midday bus just to see you. - This is Miss... - Webster.
How do you do? - How do you do?
I'm sorry I didn't see you.
It's Torquil's fault.
You'll stay here tonight.
I don't want to be any trouble. Oh, it's no trouble at all.
I haven't heard any intelligent female nonsense for months.
Besides, there's nowhere else you could go. You won't have to sleep on the floor, though the men will. Oh, don't worry.
I don't know which way you came, but I suppose you noticed the place was knocked about.
Well, it did look a bit bleak. Oh, it's no wonder.
I only just got rid of the boys. - What boys?
Well, the RAF, of course.
I've had them for two years, 80 of them, no less.
But surely they'll compensate you for the damage.
Oh, yes, they've been very fair about that, apart from trying to sell me their concrete foundations.
I wasn't having any. No, they'll pay a lump sum, or do the place up as it was. - After the war, of course.
Which are you gonna take? That's the question, Torquil, my boy.
MacLaine versus Potts.
Will you have a draft?
We'll get dinner.
We'll make a pie.
The colonel says you're a dead shot these days.
My dear Torquil, I have a tip that will improve your own shooting.
After scrounging a few cartridges out of the local comptroller, find a sitting rabbit, take aim, say to yourself,
If I don't shoot this rabbit, I don't eat," and you don't miss. - And she doesn't.
What's your other name? - Joan.
Mine's Catriona.
Can you skin a rabbit?
That's a queer girl.
Not a thing.
Then you know as much as I do.
Taming a woman must be worse than taming an eagle.
Can't be done, old boy.
It can't be done. - How's the war treated you?
Not bad. Saw the world. - Been home much?
Not for four years. - Staying long?
Eight days.
Not much.
There's a right way and a wrong way to skin a rabbit.
I only know the wrong way. Colonel, you're wanted. On parade!
I thought for a moment it was the old boy, back again. - Colonel!
Right! - What did he think he heard?
His eagle.
A little odd, isn't he?
Who isn't?
Six inch to the mile.
If the winds gets up, it'll soon blow the fog away.
Sounds as if it is. - Are you staying long on the island?
A few days. - You know anyone there?
Mm-hmm.
It's a fine island. - I know.
Been there before?
No, but I've heard all about it.
Do you know it well?
I've known it for 29 years.
I shouldn't have thought you as old as that.
Four years older.
Are you staying on the island?
I've got eight days leave. I want to spend it there.
Do you know Sir Robert Bellinger? No, I've never met him.
Does he know you're going to Kiloran? No.
Do you know him? - Very well.
Nice chap. - The nicest.
I'd like to meet him.
Well, you're bound to, aren't you, on a small island like Kiloran?
It's not so small.
I heard you could walk it in an hour and a half.
I suppose you can if you want to, but who wants to?
There are better things to do. - Such as?
Shoot grouse, fish for salmon, bathe in Kiloran Bay, picnic at Pig's Paradise.
Where's that? - On the north shore. There's an eagles' aviary there.
I promised to take the colonel.
Oh, so the colonel's going too? Yes. He's got a permit from Bellinger.
So one does need a permit? - In wartime, for ordinary visitors.
But I'm staying with a factor.
He's got a house on the west side.
Kiloran House is near the lake, isn't it? The loch, yes.
With luck, we'll be able to cross in the morning.
Oh, thanks for telling me. - See you in the morning.
Good night. - Uh, good night.
In half an hour, I shall be asleep.
There's a grand view of Kiloran from here.
At sunrise, the light shines on the sands.
With a glass, you can make out the people.
Have you got a match or a lighter? Thanks.
I'm going to be married on Kiloran.
It's an honor for Kiloran.
Well, may your pulse beat as your heart would wish.
Thank you. - Is it to be soon?
Tomorrow, weather permitting.
Have you got any beams in your room?
Yes. Why?
Count them before you go to sleep, and your wish will come true.
As easy as that?
For only the first night.
People in modern houses don't know what they're missing.
Good night.
I warn you, it doesn't work if you don't believe in it.
Please, Lord, don't let the wind drop, and let it blow the fog away.
Your counting beams certainly works. Trouble is, you wished too hard.
Why? What's the matter?
We've had a gale warning.
What will that mean?
Ruairidh Mhor will tell you.
How long will the gale last?
Oh, just as long as the wind blows, milady.
It can last for a day.
It can blow for a week. It looks so near. In half an hour, we could be there.
In less than a second, you could get from this world into the next.
Can I speak to the island?
By radio, from the Coast Guard post. - Can civilians still use it? - Yes, yes.
Where is the Coast Guard post?
Tobermory. - Can we get a car?
No need. We can go by bus.
Ruairidh, we'll be at the Western Isles Hotel.
I think perhaps we'd better move into the hotel.
We're a bit of a strain on Catriona's household. - Oh, yes, of course.
All right, then. Breakfast? And cheer up.
Oh, I'm all right.
But why just here?
It was a dry summer when they put it here, and they forgot the rain.
Hello? - It's all right.
You have a big room. - What about you?
Oh, I have a small one.
Haven't you, really? - Are you coming in now? - No, I don't think so.
But you needn't be afraid of the curse that's on the castle.
What have you heard about that?
Well, I know that it's upon the lairds of Kiloran.
I don't know whether the wives or the future wives... of the lairds are involved, but I'll risk it.
I am MacNeil of Kiloran, and I am the laird of Kiloran.
Sir Robert Bellinger has only rented it for the duration. I see.
My father never entered Moy Castle, nor did my grandfather or his father, and nor will I.
How on earth can you stand it? Aren't you curious? No.
Shall we go?
I knew you when you were a boy, Kiloran. Knew your father well. My wife is from the island.
Katie Clark.
Katie Clark? - Mm-hmm. Then you're John MacAllister.
Yes, yes. You have your father's memory, Kiloran.
And are you back for good, Kiloran? - Only a week's leave.
Oh, dear. - But it won't be long now.
Ah, no indeed. - I'm waiting for the boat. How is everybody on Kiloran?
Hmm, well, now.
They're fine.
They're very fine.
And my son was after telling me about the rich man on Kiloran.
Him that is your tenant, Kiloran.
Like a little king, he is. Yes, yes.
My wife's second cousin... was working up there the entire spring... on a swimming pond he was building.
A swimming pool. - Oh, what foolishness.
And the hold wide open sea to be swimming in.
Aye, and the loch.
Money spent is money earned. Ah, yes, yes. My wife's second cousin was not complaining.
Meat does not fall from an empty krill.
He has no care of money, the rich man of Kiloran.
He brings salmon with him from the mainland. - The waters here are full of salmon.
Who is fishing for salmon?
But who would be fishing when there's no one to be buying? So he would have to start buying before anyone would start fishing.
But can't he now fish for himself? No, he cannot.
Yes, yes, the fish do not know him, no.
What are all the guns for? Ah, we're losing lambs.
There's an eagle been seen. - Aye, a golden eagle. - And it's 12 years...
Seven years.
Since an eagle was seen in this part. - Where was it seen?
Up on the shoal.
I could hardly wish them good hunting.
Hardly. - You didn't mind what they said?
I thought it was nonsense.
Why shouldn't one build a swimming pool?
Personally, I like swimming pools. - A matter of taste. - Exactly.
I also prefer to call up the fishmonger if I want to eat some salmon... instead of wading about knee-deep in water, waiting for salmon to pass by.
The Legend of Corryvreckan"? It's the second-biggest whirlpool in Europe.
It lies just northeast of Kiloran.
Corry" means cauldron or whirlpool.
Vreckan" was a prince of Norway.
He sought the daughter of the lord of the isles in marriage.
Hello, hello, hello.
Hello, Coast Guard.
Hello, Coast Guard.
Go on.
The lord of the isles refused to give away his daughter.
Of course. He was a Scotsman. - Except on one condition:
Prince Vreckan must anchor his galley... in Corryvreckan for three days and nights.
What was the catch? - The catch was that he thought he would be drowned. It's a terrible place.
When the tide's running, whirlpools form and you can hear the roar for miles.
And that's true. You can hear it from Kiloran.
I bet he anchored, though. - What he did was to go straight back to Norway. There, he asked the advice of the old men.
They told him to take three anchor ropes, one of hemp, one of...
Wait a moment... - Flax. - Flax.
One of flax.
And you know well what the third rope was made of, Kiloran. The third rope was made of the hair of maidens... who are faithful to their lovers. Of course.
Go on.
The maidens willingly gave their tresses, and Prince Vreckan sailed for the Hebrides.
The first night, the hemp rope broke. The second night, the rope of flax broke.
The third rope held fast.
The third night... Hello, Tobermory. Hello, Tobermory.
Isle of Kiloran speaking. Isle of Kiloran speaking.
Over to you. Over.
Hello, Kiloran. Hello, Kiloran.
Tobermory speaking. Tobermory speaking. Tobermory speaking.
Miss Webster's here to talk to Sir Robert Bellinger. Stand by, please.
In there, my dear. - Thank you. Hello?
Robert?
Joan speaking.
I'm here in Tobermory.
I had a very good journey. Isn't it a shame about the weather?
If you want Sir Robert to answer, say, "Over to you."
Over to you.
Hello, my dear.
Robert speaking. I'm glad to hear your voice, at any rate.
We're all ready here, ready and waiting.
Cartier delivered the ring, I hope. I hope you like it.
I take it Hunter saw you off. Over.
Of course, Robert. Everything was lovely.
Is there anything the matter with your voice?
Have you got a cold? Over.
Oh, no, I haven't got a cold.
Do I sound as if I had? Now, listen, Joan, have you got a pencil?
Write down a telephone number. Are you ready?
2-3-6. 236. You got it?
It's the Robinson's number. They've rented the castle. Robinson's done a lot of work for me, one way or another.
He's one of the best. So's his wife. They're the only people worthwhile knowing around here.
Ring them. They'll be glad to put you up.
I'll be over to fetch you as soon as the gale blows out. Over. Hello, Robert.
I'd rather stay in a hotel. You don't mind, do you? Over.
Right, my treasure. Do just as you like. I say, Joan, Major Foster, MacNeil's factor is here beside me.
He's waiting to talk to Mr. MacNeil.
I thought he was in the Army. Over. Hello, Robert.
He's here, and he's in the Navy. Well, good-bye, Robert.
I hope to see you tomorrow. Over. Cheerio, my pet.
It'll be a quiet wedding.
But full of surprises, I promise you.
Chin up. You can always ring 236. This gale can't blow forever.
Good-bye.
Good-bye. Go ahead, Foster.
Foster speaking. Hello, Kiloran.
It's good to hear you're back, even though you're stuck in Tobermory.
Is there anything you want done? Over. Hello, Foster.
Tell Duncan that I expect the trout to jump and the krill to perch on the end of my gun. I've read all your reports.
I'm longing to talk things over. - - Good-bye, Tobermory.
Over. Good-bye, Kiloran.
Good-bye, Kiloran.
How much is that?
Well, it's nine pence each, Kiloran.
Thank you very much.
Not can change that for you, Miss Webster.
I'll pay you back at the hotel. Good.
She wouldn't see a pound note from one pensions day to another.
People around here are very poor, I suppose.
Not poor. They just haven't got money.
Any messages?
No, Mr. MacNeil.
Come on, ladies and gentlemen.
Mr. MacNeil.
Yes?
I want to ask you something.
Anything. - Do you mind if we sit at separate tables at lunch?
You do understand, don't you? - Of course I don't mind.
We are strangers. Not even properly introduced.
Yes, but you understand why I'm asking you?
I think you're the most proper young lady I've ever met.
Please let the gale drop.
I must get over to the island tomorrow.
It's blowing great guns!
The wind's shifting all the time!
It's gone from southwest to northwest since daylight! Where is it now?
Blowing from every point of the compass at once. Ruairidh says they've got savers in the northwest.
But you know all that before anybody. Poor beggar.
I bet you're fed up to the gills. No, it's all right.
I'm a patient man. I can wait. Now, listen, Colonel.
Eh?
Blast the waterfall! Speak up.
There's a good chap.
What? Big bird, my foot!
It's my eagle! That's what I'm trying to tell you.
They're after it with shotguns.
Ignorant clods! If they touch a feather of old Torquil, I'll gore 'em!
I've christened him Torquil. You don't mind, do you, chap?
He reminds me of you.
Oh, thanks. What? As to this outrageous accusation, I shall refute it!
If lambs are missing, ten to one it's a fox or a wild cat!
I don't know anything about that. Every village bumpkin believes the eagles carry schoolchildren with satchels on their backs.
Ballocks! Anything!
Absolute poppycock! Talk it over with Catriona, don't do anything rash and ring me tomorrow.
Hello, Peigi.
It's an awful pretty day, Kiloran.
Is Miss Webster about?
She's away.
Away? Where? She was away in lain's car before 8:00.
She went to Erraig, then she came back here, she used the telephone and she was away in the car again.
The family will be down in a moment, madam.
What's your name?
Good morning, Miss Cheril.
Who's she? Miss Webster has called to see Mrs. Robinson.
Can I offer you anything, Miss Webster?
No, thank you. - Are you Joan Webster?
Yes. You're going to marry Sir Robert Bellinger?
Yes. Do you mind? - I don't mind.
He's rich, isn't he?
Well, I haven't counted his money.
Are you rich?
No.
Excuse me, madam.
Can I have the afternoon off? Now, Martin, that's too bad, but I'm playing bridge.
I see, madam.
Then that's quite all right.
What do you mean? I'd intended to spend the evening at Achnacroish myself, madam.
What do you mean? Has Mrs. Crozier asked you to make a fois?
No, madam. I'm invited by Mr. Campbell, Mr. Crozier's head gardener.
He's giving a ceilidh.
It's his diamond wedding.
Diamond wedding. Fancy being married to you for 60 years.
Well, if Mr. Robinson doesn't mind, I don't.
We leave at 4:00. - Thank you.
That's all right, Martin.
Adam, surely you told me Robert was having breakfast with us!
No, my dear. I said that Robert's fiancee was coming to breakfast.
Here she is. - This is wonderful! My dear, we're going to be such friends.
That man woke me up and mumbled something. I had no idea you were here. I'd have been down in a flash.
What did Robert say your name was?
But we'll be calling you Lady Bellinger soon.
Her name's Joan Webster. Good morning, Cheril darling.
You, of course, know everything.
If only we'd known that you were stranded here.
You brought your luggage? Have the blue guest chamber open for the future Lady Bellinger, Hooper.
Well, really, I do... I'm one of Robert's oldest friends, and you're going to be his wife.
Now, let's have a look at you.
Oh, yes, you pass with honors.
That reminds me, we need a fourth at bridge.
We are going this afternoon to old Rebecca Crozier's.
Do you play?
No.
Oh, this generation.
Mind you, Cheril plays, but we're not quite in her class. She says we play a stingy game, don't you, Cheril?
Oh, fairy stories at breakfast.
Are you coming with us to see Auntie Crozier, darling?
It depends.
Now, that's too bad of you. You promised. Daddy's a witness.
Well, how are you, my dears? Come in. Come in.
Rebecca, darling, you look wonderful!
Murdoch, you go and light the lamp.
I'm sorry to have kept you all standing in the wind. Cheril.
Who is this charming young lady?
This is Joan Webster, who's going to marry Robert Bellinger.
Oh, I congratulate him.
How do you do?
Put down your things, everybody, anywhere.
Undo your own buttons.
How on earth can you manage with three people in a house like Achnacroish?
Oh, I always have plenty of guests.
They give so much work.
Not my guests, my dear.
Torquil, these are friends of mine. They've taken Sorne. The English family Robinson.
How do you do?
This is Joan Webster.
How do you do, Miss Webster?
How do you do? - Hope you've got a good long leave.
Six more days.
It's certainly far enough from the war here.
Plates, Torquil.
Anything else, ma'am?
No, thank you.
One, two, three, four, five, and half for the little one.
Did you know, Torquil, this young lady's going to be the mistress of your house? I hope you'll be very happy there.
I'm sure I shall.
Are you the owner of Kiloran? Really? How interesting.
You know, we nearly took Kiloran ourselves.
We found it just a little bit too expensive.
Your agent asked an enormous rent for it.
I'm afraid that's the only income I ever get from Kiloran.
You see, for three years' rent, I can live there myself for six. - That's highland economics.
Everybody's had tea?
Rebecca!
Yes, please.
If I was to let my house, I should never live to enjoy the money I would get for it.
Oh, you'll outlive us all. Achnacroish is a breeding place for Methuselahs. - Look at Campbell.
Gardener's giving the Ceilidh.
Martin's invited.
Campbell's diamond wedding. Quite a start on you, my dear. - I'll catch up.
I shall have to put in an appearance later on.
But bridge first. Thank you.
Yes, bridge first.
Have you ever seen any highland dancing? No, never.
You ought to see our Oban gathering in peacetime.
Of course, it's not so big or famous and Braymar or Inverness, but it has its own quality. - You came through Oban?
Yes.
The harbor was wonderful. And that lovely green island.
Imagine it full of yachts, big and small. And there's racing and highland games all day.
And at night... at night, they give a ball.
You can't imagine what a wonderful sight it is.
The assembly rooms are all hung with special hangings in dark red.
And the women wear tiaras, those that have them. Oh, the place blazes with jewels. The men...
The men are more splendid than the women.
With their velvet doublets and scarlet waistcoats,
Their lace, cuffs and jabots. Their buttons of gold and silver, their cairngorms.
Their buckle shoes and their filibegs of every shade and color.
And the pipes play, and we dance. We dance all night... till the sun shines through the curtains.
Lovely.
What does filibeg mean? The kilt.
It really means "the little kilt" as worn nowadays. Now, what about bridge?
Joan doesn't play.
Do you play, Mr. MacNeil?
Oh, I'm sorry, no.
I can't see from here. - You can see more from the ladder.
Do you mind going up a little further?
One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four.
Martin, it's Scottish, not a minuet.
They must've come over from the mainland.
Do you think you could dance the Scottish? - I think so.
Good.
I suppose we ought to go back now.
Oh, no hurry.
Friends and neighbors, I ask a hundred thousand blessings on my father and mother.
They're 60 years married this day.
Peace and happiness be with them.
The pride of the great Clan Campbell.
Come on, Mr. Campbell.
How about you and I going outside and having a little ceilidh on our own?
I went down to Erraig this morning. - I know. - I went into Moy Castle.
Did you?
Shall I tell you what it's like inside?
Yes, please.
It's just as you told me in the story.
I saw the hall where MacNeil feasted... and the dungeon and the thickness of the wall.
It's awful. And on the ramparts at the top, there's a stone-
With a curse written on it.
You've been inside. No, but I was young once.
I had a nanny.
No! - Mm-hmm.
Anyway, I've read it.
It's a terrible strong curse. - Terrible.
Leave me alone.
Now you know why a MacNeil dreads to enter the castle.
No! No! No!
It's only you I love. - You do? - Yes.
Come and get it! - Buns? - Aye.
Excuse me, but is you not MacNeil of Kiloran?
Yes, and you'll be a Campbell. - John Campbell of Kiloran.
I must tell my father that you're here.
You'll do nothing of the sort. A MacNeil at a Campbell ceilidh.
Hey!
Wait a minute now! Allister.
Naught Brown Maidens." Do you know it? Tune up, boys!
It goes, "A Rome and a brown maiden.
A ream and a brown maiden. Row, row, row, maiden.
You are the maid for me."
Is this the way to treat an old friend on the day of his diamond wedding?
We didn't want to intrude, Mr. Campbell.
Here's length of good life to you and Mrs. Campbell. Thank you indeed, Kiloran.
Intrude, is it? You and your lady must come in and meet Mrs. Campbell.
Torquil, I must go. - You can't go now.
It's going to be a grand ceilidh, just grand.
It's very good of you, but Kiloran knows I must get back.
Kiloran knows nothing of the sort.
You must see the dancing.
But I saw perfectly well from here, thank you.
You've seen nothing yet, milady.
We've got three pipers.
Three of'em, just by luck.
They were ordered by the rich man on Kiloran.
Just by luck, they couldn't get.
It was the gale stopped them. Cheer up. They are your pipers.
How do you do, Mrs. Campbell? This is Miss Webster.
May I be allowed to say that you were the best dancers at the ceilidh.
Thank you, Martin.
You know how important it is for me to get to Kiloran.
Please... let the gale drop... or let me get to the island somehow.
Please. Please.
Hello, Kenny.
Good morning, Miss Webster.
Wind's backing a bit.
Uh-huh.
It's not blowing near so hard.
Oh, yes, tomorrow we'll be crossing to Kiloran, or maybe the day after.
But not today? - Himself is going to Tobermory by the bus to see the dentist.
Tooth aching this morning?
No, but if he doesn't go now, there's no saying when the next gale will be.
It's only then himself has the time.
Saw you at the ceilidh. How old are you, Bridie?
I'll be 17. - You'll be marrying soon.
When the right man comes along.
How old are you, Kenny?
Eighteen. Getting on. Not thinking of taking a wife?
Oh, I'll be called up soon.
But anyway, I'd have to wait another three or four years.
Or even more. - Why is that, Kenny? - It takes money to get married.
How much?
Twenty pounds.
Himself is asking that for half a share in the boat.
Who's himself?
Ruairidh Mhor. - Father.
I should have thought he would've given you a share as a wedding present, Kenny.
If Kenny can buy half, he'll get the other half for nothing, right enough.
Good day to you, milady. - Good day. - Good day to you, Kiloran.
I wish it was. Oh, it will be.
Yes, yes, it will be.
Oh, yes, yes, indeed it will be.
Yes, yes, it will be.
Of course, I am not saying it is not blowing as much as it was, but it is near the end of it.
Indeed, it is just like the sun, milady.
It seems always biggest just before it sets. - A poet, Ruairidh, boy. - Do you think we can cross today?
No, no, no, milady, no.
Well, will you stand by in case it drops?
I'll pay you for your time, of course.
You said it might blow down. It's very important.
I must get across.
I'll pay you anything you ask. I will take you to Kiloran as soon as it is humanly possible, milady, and I will not be wanting extra payment for that.
We'll be up at the house. And I will be in Tobermory.
Fine doings indeed.
That girl is so foolish. She's a woman already.
Colonel's doing it. - Good.
Hello, Joan.
Hello. Hello.
Torquil.
Will you help me to get to Kiloran? If I had a fair-sized boat.
But I haven't even a small one.
But Ruairidh would listen to you. If you asked him, he'd try to get me there.
Besides, you're wasting your whole leave. - I don't mind. Yes, you do.
You haven't been there for years.
I don't mind.
his duty, if you like.
If he could, he would. Can't you wait till tomorrow?
I can't ask him to risk his life or yours.
He's been out in a gale often enough. - If a ship was in danger...
It's different when people are in danger and need help. Yes, but...
What?
I want help desperately. Do you think it will blow out tomorrow?
I don't think so.
Congratulate me, young lady.
Torquil the eagle is found.
His good name's cleared.
It was a fox killing the lambs.
A shepherd saw it.
The old boy's safe and sound. - Found. I'm off there after lunch with a lure.
By gad, I hope I get him back.
You coming?
I'd like to. What about you?
We'll be back by tea time.
I think I'll stay here.
But I can see something else.
You know, Torquil...
Pot him.
Please, ma'am, I'd like to be speaking to Miss Webster.
It's about the boat, miss. Don't be thinking of taking it out, miss.
Himself will murder Kenny.
Nonsense. I'll look after your father. Anyway, Kenny's a man.
But never in a gale! Himself would never take it out.
But it's blowing out. Your father said so.
It's going down all the time. - Himself would never take it out today.
What about the money? Do you want to wait another four years to marry him?
Well, I would, then, if it has to be.
Some folks there are can't be waiting a day to satisfy their passions.
What are you saying?
Some folks there are want to drown fine young men and break poor girls' hearts... so that they can be wedded one day sooner!
You'd better get out! - I'll get out when I please.
Who are you to be giving orders, you that come to this city... with your airs and graces and your heart of stone?
Why should you think that our lives don't matter at all... and that yours is so important?
But you don't understand. Bridie, don't cry.
You think that I'm risking Kenny's life when I could stay safely here. But I'm not safe here.
I'm on the brink of losing everything I ever wanted.
What do you think you're doing?
You're off to losing Ruairidh's boat and drowning.
Don't be a fool, Kenny. How much did she pay you?
Twenty pounds. Now who's the fool? I'll make it up to you.
Come on, boy. Give her back her dirty money.
Ah, Kiloran, I can't do it.
I promised. She made me promise, and that's the truth of it.
Oh, Kiloran! - Where's Miss Webster?
Go on, say something.
I will. Are you a complete fool? Well?
How dare you speak to me like that?
Is it not enough that you've been told that you cannot sail today?
Ruairidh said it was going down.
Kenny said so too. What do you expect Kenny to say? You bought him!
There's no need to shout! - Why, the lad has never seen £20 in his life.
If you must commit suicide, why can't you do it in Manchester?
Don't shout at me! You're insulting!
And stop bothering about me! - What about Kenny? - Well, what about him?
What about Bridie? What about the crew? What about their wives?
What about their children?
Do you think I'm standing here wasting time over you?
I'm not interested in your reasons.
Are you not?
Are you interested in anything but yourself?
I do know how to mind own business!
That won't carry you far on this island or on Kiloran.
You can have this island, and you can have Kiloran!
Fine!
Then you won't be in any hurry to get there.
You can't think you know more about these waters than Ruairidh.
Because he wanted to go to the dentist.
Oh, go ahead, then!
And drown yourself!
Torquil. - Mm-hmm?
They'll never make it. - What do you expect me to do?
She'd only jump out the window.
She doesn't realize the danger.
And you're the last person to stop her.
I?
She's running away from you!
Say that again.
Are you the praying type?
Sometimes.
Are you?
Always.
If we can stay on our course and right side up, we've got a chance.
Aren't we on our course? Every mile nearer Kiloran, we're two miles nearer Scaba.
Is that dangerous? - Yes. - Why?
Corryvreckan. The whirlpool.
You never finished the story about the Norwegian prince.
You said that two ropes broke.
What happened to the one made from the hair of faithful maidens?
It held until the tide turned. Nothing is stronger than love. No, nothing.
Feeling sick? - Oh, no.
But one maiden was untrue to her lover.
Kiloran!
Look out!
This is the way to bail!
Get the cover!
My dear chap, my very dear chap, you've missed the experience of a lifetime!
Have I? - You certainly have.
While you've been messing about, a new chapter has been written in the history of falconry.
Oh, you've got him back. - Ah, listen to this.
He was up on the warren and came to the lure like a lamb...
like a hawk, I mean. Then MacGillivray suggest a hunt for this fox that's been killing the lambs.
So we went off, and, by gad, we found the fox, and by Jimmy Christmas, he caught it!
Caught it? Who? - Torquil!
Stooped at the blighter as though it was a rabbit. Killed him stone dead. Here he is.
God fox. £20 of his allowance.
I'm gonna have the brush mounted for you, Torquil.
Now what have you got to say? - Where is he?
Torquil, come on!
Wah, loo-loo-loo! Tally-ho!
Get onto him!
You must think I'm awful.
I don't think anyone's awful.
Not even when I'm breaking my neck to marry a rich man? Oh, what's wrong with that?
I thought you didn't care about money. Who says so?
I'd swim to Oban for £10.
Glasgow for 20.
And what about Torquil? He'd do it for 15. Oh.
But I thought that you and Rebecca Crozier and Torquil... were perfectly happy without money.
Well, you could sell Erraig, and Rebecca could sell Achnacroish... and Torquil could sell Kiloran.
Yes.
But money isn't everything. Now go to sleep.
Thank you.
Good night, Catriona.
And if you count the beams, your prayers will come true.
Now, Torquil, onto your perch.
That's it.
I can't do anything with my hair.
I wonder what happened to my wedding dress.
A mermaid will marry in it.
How is Kenny this morning?
Butter wouldn't melt in his mouth. He's helping Ruairidh with the boat.
And who's to Kiloran? Not the colonel.
The only persons I can see... are you and three pipers.
I'd better go down and meet him.
Always the little lady doing the right thing. I'm sorry.
You're all right as you are. Bye-bye, Mrs. Potts. I'm for the bus.
Will you do something for me?
It depends.
I don't care where or when, but somewhere, sometime, will you have the pipers play "A Rome and a Brown Maiden"?
It might be done.
Will you do something for me before I go away? It depends.
Now, Mr. Torquil, I've told you a thousand times.
Once upon a time, hundreds of years ago,
MacNeil of Kiloran took a beautiful wife from the mainland.
But she was in love with a cousin of hers, a MacLaine who held Moy Castle.
After a year and a day, when her husband was away ravaging the mainland, she escaped from Kiloran... and took refuge in Moy Castle with her lover.
One black night, Kiloran came.
He besieged and took the castle... and killed every soul except the two lovers. There's a deep dungeon just off the back of the great hall.
It's a well with nine feet of water in it... and a rounded stone... just big enough for a man to stand upon... or drown.
Kiloran stripped the two lovers, chained them together... and threw them into the dungeon.
He sat in the great hall... feasting upon them while they held one another... above the water till their strength failed... and they dragged one another down.
Before she died, the woman cursed Kiloran... and every future MacNeil of Kiloran... if they should ever cross the threshold of the castle.
There to this day. It's a terrible strong curse.
It goes...
This is the curse of Catriona MacLaine of Erraig. "My curse on MacNeil of Kiloran...
and every MacNeil after him.
If he shall ever cross the threshold of Moy, never shall he leave it a free man. "
I was lying to you.
I'd rather swim in the sea than in a swimming pool.
I know.
And I'd rather catch salmon in my own stream, if somebody would teach me how. I know.
And I'd rather see Ruairidh Mhor not have the hell I've raised.
I was lying to you too.
I'm not really afraid of this place. - I know.
Never shall he leave it a free man.
He shall be chained to a woman till the end of his days... and he shall die in his chains. "
# I know where I'm going #
# And I know who's going with me #
# I have stockings of silk #
# Shoes of fine green leather # # Combs to buckle my hair #
# And a ring for every finger # # Some say he's black #
# But I say he's bonny # # The fairest of them all #
# I know where I'm going #
# And I know who's going with me # # I know who I love #
Miss Carmichael, please.
Dr. Petersen is ready for you.
I'm awfully sorry. I have to go.
Had a perfect hand. Would've beaten the pants off you.
Harry will take you, Miss Carmichael.
Thank you.
Watch her carefully.
Don't take your eyes off her.
How are you today, Harry?
Fine.
You look a little bilious.
It's the light.
I worry about you, dear.
I'll be all right.
Must we dash into Dr. Petersen's office?
Can't we go sit somewhere in private and talk, just you and I?
Love it, if I had time.
Would you?
Come in.
You ruined a very interesting card game, Dr. Petersen.
You may go now, Harry.
I'll be outside.
I hope you feel better today, Mary.
Well, I don't.
You will.
I think this whole thing is ridiculous.
What whole thing, Mary?
Psychoanalysis.
It bores the pants off of me.
Lying on the couch like some dreary nitwit, telling all.
You don't really expect to get anywhere listening to me babble about my idiotic childhood.
Really.
My patients invariably regard me as a wretched nuisance during our first talks.
I see. It's my subconscious putting up a fight.
It doesn't want me cured.
Exactly. It wants to continue enjoying your disease.
Our job is to make you understand why.
When you know why you're doing something that's bad for you and when you first started doing it.
Then you can begin curing yourself.
You mean I've been telling you lies?
The usual proportion.
You're right.
I've been lying like mad.
I hate men. I loathe them.
If one of them so much as touches me,
I want to sink my teeth into his hands and bite it off.
In fact, I did that once.
Do you care to hear about it?
Tell me anything you remember.
We were dancing.
He kept asking me to marry him, panting in my ear.
I suddenly pretended I was going to kiss him and sank my teeth into his mustache and bit it clear off.
You're laughing at me.
That smug frozen face of yours doesn't take me in.
You just want me to tell you all this so you can feel superior to me.
You and your drooling science. I detest you.
I never want to see that nasty face of yours again!
I can't bear you.
You and your nickel's worth of nothing!
Come on, Miss Carmichael. Silly fool.
Letting a creature like that worry me.
Miss Frozen Puss.
Dr. Fleurot, I want to talk to you alone.
I can't stand that woman.
I'll see you later, Mary.
Come, Miss Carmichael.
Murchison must be really out of his mind to assign Carmichael to you.
You may report your findings to the new head when he arrives.
You can't treat a love veteran like Carmichael without some inside information.
I've done a great deal of research on emotional problems - and love difficulties.
Research, my eye.
I've watched your work for six months. It's brilliant but lifeless.
There's no intuition in it.
You approach all your problems with an ice pack on your head.
Are you making love to me?
I will in a moment.
I'm just clearing the ground first.
I'm trying to convince you that your lack of human and emotional experience is bad for you as a doctor
and fatal for you as a woman.
I've heard that argument from a number of amorous psychiatrists who all wanted to make a better doctor of me.
But I've got a much better argument.
I'm terribly fond of you.
Why?
It's rather like embracing a textbook.
Why do you do it then?
Because you're not a textbook.
You're a sweet, pulsing, adorable woman underneath.
I sense it every time I come near to you.
You sense only your own desires and pulsations.
I assure you, mine in no way resemble them.
Stop it.
I'm mad about you.
I'm afraid I'm boring you. No.
Your attitudes are very interesting.
You're exactly like Miss Carmichael. I'd like to throw a book at you.
But I won't.
May I borrow this?
Certainly.
Oh, and forgive me for my criticism.
I think you'd better stick to books.
And another thing...
Pardon me for marching in, but I'm spreading the tidings.
My successor will be due any moment.
Dr. Murchison, it's been a pleasure working under you.
Thank you very much.
Coming, Dr. Petersen?
I'm in no mad hurry to welcome Dr. Edwardes.
It's hard to imagine this place without you, Dr. Murchison.
Yes, I sort of go with the fixtures.
More than that. You are Green Manors. It seems unfair.
You're very young in the profession.
You haven't learned the basic secret of science.
The old must make way for the new, particularly when the old is suspected of a touch of senility.
That's ridiculous.
I should think the Board of Directors would realize you're feeling much better.
You've been like a new man since your vacation.
The Board's as fair and all-knowing as a hospital board can be.
I agree with you. I'm as able and brilliant as ever.
But having crumbled once, I might crumble again.
You were overworked.
A charming diagnosis for a broken-down horse.
I shall always remember your cheerfulness today as a lesson in how to accept reality, Dr. Murchison.
Don't be too taken in by my happy air, Constance.
It's the least difficult way of saying goodbye to 20 years.
Yes, I know.
Come in.
Your mail, Dr. Petersen and Mr. Garmes.
Come in, Mr. Garmes.
You're not leaving today? I'll see you again?
I shall hover around for a while like an old mother hen.
At least until Dr. Edwardes is firmly on the list.
How do you feel today, Mr. Garmes?
Somewhat better, Doctor. The thing seems a little less troublesome.
May I do that for you, Doctor?
Thank you, no. I can do this myself very well.
Please sit down. I'll be with you in a moment.
So that's the mighty Anthony Edwardes.
He looks a little younger than I expected.
He's only brought one suitcase.
Perhaps he doesn't intend to remain very long.
Leave those daydreams to Dr. Murchison.
Gentlemen, our new chief, Dr. Anthony Edwardes.
Dr. Fleurot. - How do you do?
How do you do?
I am Dr. Graff.
How do you do?
Dr. Hanish.
How do you do?
There's still some staff members missing, Dr. Edwardes.
These are your quarters.
They're very festive for an institution.
Dr. Edwardes, Dr. Murchison.
How do you do, Dr. Murchison? I've heard a great deal about you, sir.
And I naturally about you.
You're younger than I thought you'd be.
My age hasn't caught up with me yet.
Mine has, it seems.
I'm pleased to hand over the reins to steadier hands.
I'm leaving you my library which contains, amongst other items of interest, your latest volume, The Labyrinth of the Guilt Complex.
I hope Green Manors will inspire others as fine.
I'm very grateful.
I don't know the formal words for an abdication, Dr. Edwardes.
May I say, merely, that these quarters which I've occupied for 20 years are now yours.
Will you excuse me?
I spent a half-hour with Dr. Edwardes.
I must say, I was most favorably impressed.
I intend to learn a great deal from Dr. Edwardes.
I think we all can, from a man with such obvious talents.
You're familiar with his work?
Yes, I've read all his books.
A very keen, unorthodox mind.
It would be dreadful if Dr. Murchison's successor was unworthy of him.
He's joining us.
I think you know everyone here, Dr. Edwardes.
No, not yet.
This is Dr. Petersen.
How do you do?
Dr. Edwardes.
Dr. Hanish has been showing me the grounds.
It's a remarkable institution, Dr. Murchison.
Must be quite beautiful in the summer.
I pointed out to Dr. Edwardes our various open-air diversions for the patients.
Dr. Murchison always argued we did not do enough in that direction, and I agree with him.
Let me warn you that Dr. Petersen is a frustrated gymnast.
Dr. Fleurot considers anything beyond sitting and standing gymnastics.
I imagine you're very fond of sports.
Yes, I am, and I miss them, particularly winter sports.
Did you show Dr. Edwardes the elm grove?
Yes, yes indeed.
That's where we hope to have our new swimming pool.
I'm a great believer in the swimming pool.
There's a perfect spot for it among the elms.
Not an oblong one, but an irregular pool, something...
Something like this, you know.
Bathhouses should be here.
I take it that the supply of linen at this institution is inexhaustible!
Forgive me.
That reminds me of my professor in psychiatry, Dr. Brulov.
He could never stand a sauce bottle on the table or even a salt shaker.
They took his appetite away.
I remember once at a banquet in his honor, he refused to sit at the speaker's table because he was completely surrounded by... by ketchup.
Last night at dinner, a dimple appeared in your cheek that was never there before.
And I detected the outcroppings of a mother instinct toward Dr. Edwardes.
I detest that sort of high-school talk.
Your reactions have upset one of my pet theories about you.
To wit, that you were immune to psychoanalysts and would end up in the arms of some Boob McNutt with spiked hair.
If I were looking for that type, Dr. Fleurot, I would long ago have adored you.
Come in.
Excuse me, it's from Dr. Edwardes.
Love notes already.
The French school of science.
I didn't want to come to this institution, but my brother insisted.
I can see no sense in it myself.
